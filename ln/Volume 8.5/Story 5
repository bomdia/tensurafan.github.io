# Story 5: Hot Spring

All right, this may seem sudden, but it's a matter concerning the region to the west of the wetlands that the lizardmen inhabited. There you would find a vast underground cavern, the natural labyrinth formed by an active volcano. Its complex interior structure was made up of countless winding roads, spanning an area so immense, that even the lizardmen were unable to fully grasp it. Should you choose to explore one of these paths, you might be led to a frozen cave world, whereas another might lead to a world of burning lava. There also seemed to be hidden paths that lead to magical hotspots, though they were deemed too dangerous to traverse.

However, the labyrinth wasn't the focus of this expedition. Rather, it was the existence of the active volcano. Because of that, there might be hot springs there as well---that thought set this whole thing in motion.

![soft scene break]

"Everyone! I want to take baths in hot springs. What do you all think?" my voice echoed in the meeting room, though my thoughts didn't seem to resonate with everyone too well.

"I mean...a hot spring is just hot water, right? You can just wash yourself in the river."

"Hm-hm, in Dwargon, hot spring water is channeled into the bathhouse, but I didn't think much of it."

The dwarves Kaijin and Garm seemed uninterested, Dold and Mildo also nodded in agreement with Kaijin. Hot springs didn't seem to be anything special, well that view wasn't necessarily wrong. But my vision was completely different from the dwarves'.

"Hot...spring?" Benimaru pondered. "What is that supposed to be?"

"Seems to be a place accumulating hot water boiled by a volcano's extreme heat, isn't it?" Souei answered quickly, he was surprisingly knowledgeable.

Anyway, regarding those who had no interest in hot springs, I needed to make them understand the beauty of bathing. In terms of hygiene, bathing at a bathhouse could prevent disease; more importantly, as a former Japanese I'd made up my mind to promote bathing culture and was looking forward to enjoying it for that reason. But I suppose that went without saying.

"Exactly! Well, there are volcanic mountains without hot springs, but we'll ignore that for now. As Souei said, hot springs heated by volcanoes are the goal of this expedition. By heating the water underground, a variety of minerals get dissolved in the water, which I've heard are very good for your body. I would even go so far as to say that it is the best cure for a tired body after combat."

After emphasizing that part, Benimaru also seemed intrigued.

"Sounds pretty good, it would be interesting to try it out."

"Incredible, Rimuru-sama, you sure know a lot."

It seemed like they had warmed up to my idea, so next up I had to win over the old dwarves.

"Moreover, imagine this: you have to wear some clothes while bathing in the river, correct? If you were only taking a bucket shower you wouldn't take off all your clothes, but if you were bathing in a hot spring then it would be completely reasonable to take off all clothes."

"No, even so..."

"We're fine with just a normal shower, right?"

"..."

Hmph. These old guys were slow on the uptake.

"Whatever you guys wish, but at least try to use your imagination a bit, for instance---"

"Ah?!" Before I could describe things in detail, Kaijin seemed to have realized something. "...Could it be! Master, to think you are---"

After Kaijin, Garm also figured out what I was trying to say.

"Fufufu, it seems you all have noticed. It is precisely that, my friends. It should be heavenly for you guys, don't you agree?"

My words made them gulp; their eyes now glowing with enthusiasm, it was the polar opposite of their previous attitude.

"Besides, the beauty of hot springs lies in the tradition of mixed bath---"

"Young Master, allow me to help!"

"Of course, we are all companions!"

"Hmm...that's how it is!"

"...!!"

![break]

The dwarves were now fully on board with the plan. Benimaru seemed to be on the fence about it, while Souei showed a disinterested expression.

And so, the operation bringing hot springs to Tempest began.

![soft scene break]

So why was bathing not possible? No, it doesn't mean there was no way to bathe, it was a far simpler problem---the expenses were way too high. The large amount of firewood required to heat a hot spring was unaffordable. Although we already collected scraps and woodchips left over from all of the construction projects, there was no way this would be a sustainable source. Even though we collected branches from the forest, cooking also required fire, so it would seem irresponsible to waste firewood on bathing.

![break]

Now that the on-site investigation had been completed, we'd discovered the most suitable source with the right temperature. Now it was time for me to utilize my Skills; using 'Shadow Step' to connect Tempest and the hot springs through pipelines out of magisteel. Normally, working in the shadow space forced you to hold your breath, but that wasn't a concern for me. The real problem I was facing here was the nightmare of routing all the different pipelines within the shadow space. Luckily for me, I could leave it all in the hands of 'Great Sage', who made quick work of this issue.

The dwarves decorated the bathhouse with ornately carved marble. The words "Mixed Bath" must have given them plenty of motivation since the final result looked extremely luxurious. At a glance, one could already feel the opulent atmosphere radiating from the elegant construction.

The hot spring later became a famous attraction for visitors from all around the world, but that's a story for another time.

![break]

Eh, so what happened to the "Mixed Bath," you ask? As if things really worked like that in this world.

"Oh wow, you did a tremendous job, as expected of dwarven craftsman. Now that the **FEMALE ONLY** side is finished, I hope the male only side you've planned to make will turn out just as exquisitely," Shuna said with her most charming smile, immediately shutting down any room for discussion.

Benimaru comforted the dwarves by saying things such as "it's good enough that we got hot springs". So, they would continue to build the male only bathhouse 'enthusiastically'. It was all according to plan.

By the way, since I was a slime, I got to enter the female only side to my heart's content, but that didn't have anything to do with them.
