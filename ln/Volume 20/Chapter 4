# Chapter 4: Battle of the|Sacred Tree


Returning to a time before Veldora's departure:

In order to stop Milim's rampage, I performed a 'Spatial Transportation' and went to the old Eurazania region.
The area that Velzard covered with ice and snow was too difficult to reach directly due to poor visibility. In anticipation of this, we arrived at a point a short distance away from the site.
From there, we followed a straight line, searching for signs.
Because Milim and Velzard were supposed to be clashing, I approached them with caution.
But my thinking was wrong.
And in a bad way...

"Tch, you're earlier than I expected. But it's too late now. Milim, use your power to destroy the Sacred Tree!!"

Not only Milim and Velzard, but also Feldway was there.
Or rather, he appeared to be a different person, so much so that one would wonder if he was truly Feldway.
He had an overwhelming presence.
It was so overwhelming that I doubted I could win even if I were to fight seriously now.
And for some reason, he was haughtily giving orders to Milim.

Milim, however, had undergone a terrible change.
It was unclear and deformed in the video, but up close, her ominous form was obvious.
Upon her back was a pair of jet-black wings. A single red horn was sprouted from her forehead and glowed with iridescent colors. The rest of her bare skin was covered with hard, shining dragon scales of dully changing hues, with mysterious patterns floating on them.

I wondered if this was the true 'Stampede' Milim, and at the same time, I sensed a power that almost made me shudder.
Demon Lord Milim, who has manifested as an incarnation of absolute destruction, was truly a being worthy of the title "Destroyer."
Why was such a Milim taking orders from someone?
What in the world is going on...

![break]

<<The 'Regalia Dominion' was an ability of the Ultimate Skill 'Justice King Michael'. It seems that Feldway has succeeded in controlling Milim.>>

![break]

Wha?
No, hold on a minute?
As if the rampaging Milim isn't bad enough, but now she's being used as a pawn by Feldway?!
That's already something beyond the worst-case scenario...

![break]

<<Fortunately, it doesn't seem like he has complete control. Even though Feldway has turned the entire calculation domain over for Milim's control, it seems that he is only able to issue simple commands.>>

![break]

No, no, even that is more than enough.
I'm just lucky he didn't order her to kill me.

Feldway didn't seem happy about our appearance, so he was not planning to fight here. He didn't pay any mind to us, and just gave the order to Milim and left.

![break]

<<Because Milim's control is unstable, he may be inflexible. Or perhaps he wants to prioritize the destruction of the Sacred Tree.>>

![break]

Does that mean that Feldway's control does not allow him to revoke an order once it has been given?
That was quite possible.
Just the idea of a serious Milim trying to kill me in earnest made me shudder. I should have been glad that it wasn't the case, but I never thought that something like this would happen.

![break]

<<It is completely unexpected. The fact that she went out of control means she must have lost her ability to resist...>>

![break]

I, too, had known that Feldway had a domination ability, but I never considered the possibility that Milim could be manipulated. Ciel-san could not be blamed alone.
In the first place, Milim should have been very strong against the domination power. She had always said that such a power would not work on her.
If it wasn't for her rampaging state, it was assumed that the domination would have never succeeded.
No, rather that was what he was aiming for...

![break]

<<If we let Milim run berserk, the world is in danger of collapsing. However, to remove that worry with Regalia Dominion...it's a very bad gamble.>>

![break]

Since Ciel-san is so vague about it, it must have been a strategy that would hardly succeed.
Frankly, it would be crazy to do that.
If that's the case, there's no point in worrying about it.
More importantly, what is this Sacred Tree that Feldway had set as Milim's goal?

![break]

<<It is a divine tree that protects the capital of the Sorcerer's Dynasty of Sarion. It is a tree large enough to hold even a huge city, and seems to play a role in stabilizing the magicules of this world and preventing natural disasters.>>

![break]

Ciel-san answered my question smoothly.
It's as knowledgeable and reliable as ever, but I couldn't ignore what was just said.
I have never been to Sarion, but it seems that the capital of the country was in a tree---ah, that's not it. I could only picture it vaguely, but if the capital is in the tree, it would be a disaster if said tree was destroyed.
We must stop them, that's all there is to it.
If that's not possible...

If not, we must at least buy enough time to evacuate the residents, or else there's no doubt that it would surely be a catastrophe.

"Hey, now, that sounds like quite the predicament."

Guy expressed his opinion as if it were someone else's business.
This isn't a children's essay, so he should say something more substantial.

"Do you have something to complain about?"

"No, I don't. I'm sorry."

*I don't need that kind of presence detection,* I wanted to complain, but I tend to get caught up in things that are too long.
I pulled out of the situation so that we could comfortably do our best.
Rather than thanking me for my response, Guy complained in a disgusted tone.

"Still, that bastard Feldway... He's as sly as ever."

"Hm?"

"I'm just wondering if it turned out to be a good decision to let you take me along," Guy said, and I agreed with him.

I was finally able to persuade Guy to come here, but if Guy had not come because he was worried about Ivarage's attack, it would have been a dead end at that point.
Guy was able to deal with Velzard, and I was able to deal with Milim.
If it had been just me...

Whoops, I don't care about such hypotheticals.
There is no time to dawdle, Milim is on the move.

![break]

Guy naturally went in front of Velzard.

I tried to follow Milim after calling El-tan to let her know what was going on, but for some reason, I couldn't get through to her cell phone.
It was as if she was busy---I had a bad feeling about that.
There was no choice but to follow Milim while contacting Benimaru.

While connecting 'Telepathy Net' to Benimaru, I tried desperately to catch up with Milim and launch attacks in an attempt to attract her attention. However, Milim did not care about my attacks.
While they weren't serious attacks, they were still very powerful.
I had no time to lament.
Milim simply roared, and a mysterious power burst out.

The principle behind it was probably that the sound vibrations from her voice interfered with and broke molecular bonds. I managed to escape, but a river dried up in the aftermath.
It would be too dangerous to mess with Milim unwisely. I thought so, but at this rate, I knew that the collapse of Sarion was imminent unless something was done.
While wondering what I was going to do, I felt Benimaru and connected through telepathy.

![break]

<<Although the probability of success is low, I've come up with a plan.>>

![break]

There was no more time for hesitation.
With the extraordinary speed of flight, dozens of times faster than the speed of sound, we were very close to reaching Sarion.
Even if the success rate of the strategy was low, I had no choice but to bet everything on Ciel-san.
And so, I came to the usual conclusion, informing Benimaru about the situation and ordering him to carry out the operation despite my doubts.


![hard scene break]


The Sorcerer's Dynasty of Sarion was currently in an unprecedented crisis.
Despite pandemonium breaking out around her, the Emperor Elmesia asked her mother, Silvia, in an easygoing tone of voice, while maintaining her normal, nonchalant demeanor, "So then, do you think Rimu-chi is going to come?"

"It's not possible. It seems that Demon Lord Milim has gone berserk, and he's on his way to stop her."

"Are you kidding me?!"

Elmesia couldn't hide her surprise as the situation had turned out to be more troublesome than she had imagined.

"Incidentally, it seems that the cause of the problem was Frost Dragon Velzard, so he even brought Demon Lord Guy."

It was one thing to say that he brought Guy, but only Rimuru could really do such a thing.
Understanding this, Elmesia had no choice but to let it slide.
That being said, this would be a problem.

Currently, the capital of Sarion, the city embraced by the Sacred Tree, has been turned into a scene from hell by Jahil's onslaught.
Not only Jahil, but there was even a man who called himself the Three Star Commander Zalario, and the area was in chaos.

"The Sacred Tree's defense system has been reinforced to the limit, but it's still no use at this point..."

Elmesia was worried about the situation.
The Magus was mobilizing all of their resources to deal with the situation, but one after another they were being shot down. Even so, Elmesia felt that it was great that they hadn't yet been destroyed.
Sarion was proud of their Magus, a group of high-ranking military officers who were also known as "pure-blood knights".

They were the ones who were qualified mediators as full-powered representatives of the Emperor.
Consisting only of those ancestral to the ancient bloodline, they were considered to be the supreme force of the Sorcerer's Dynasty of Sarion---that said, in reality, they were an order of knights composed of those who were compatible with a "magic cavalry" weapon.

Needless to say, these "magitech knights"---also known as Magus---were a national secret. The reason why they were called by the same name was to protect the secret from being leaked.
Their overall height was about 5 meters. They had a magisteel exterior and were powered by dragon muscle fibers. It was an intelligent weapon that possessed its own ego and would search for its own mark.
The true essence of this weapon could only be displayed while with its rider. Just as the true mastery of spirit users was to assimilate with spirits, these magitech knights were also designed to release their true power only when they were ridden by their masters.

Normally, they were stored in the space of a magical gem that had been processed into a necklace or a bracelet.
As a side note, Kabal and Gido also had them. When they had been confronted with the rampaging Ifrit where they first met Rimuru and his friends, they had been prepared to call upon the Magus.

However, mobilizing the Magus in other nations would be subject to the charge of leaking confidential information, and would surely be a liability for Duke Elalude. Moreover, even if they had launched the Magus, it was uncertain whether they could win against Ifrit. They had been fighting in person, judging that they did not need the Magus if they only needed to protect Elen and let her escape.
The true strength of Kabal and Gido was equivalent to A rank, and their fighting ability did not change enough to double even if they used the Magus. This was also the reason why Duke Elalude had chosen them as Elen's guards.

Thus, the fighting abilities of each individual varied widely, and there were also those who were weak on their own yet unbeatable when in the state of being a rider. The fighting ability of such Magus was at least equivalent to special A rank. About three hundred of them were currently facing the enemy in a squadron.

"I didn't know we had so many Magus."

"I've been working on it diligently."

The thirteen royal families of Sarion often quarreled with each other, but this time they seemed to be united in their efforts, and they appeared to have invested their forces without any hesitation.
Even so, things would have been useless if they had opposed the plan and Elmesia had intended to abandon the idea if that had happened. It was a blessing in disguise that this was not the case.
Be that as it may, the conversation between Elmesia and Silvia continued.

"Since Elemental Colossus development is also proceeding at Rimu-chi's place, it looks like our advantage will be lost in no time."

"If that happens, they'll probably try to propose a joint development, won't they?"

"Well, I guess so. Rimu-chi is sensible, and we all agree that we don't want our dangerous forces to leak out, so I think they will distribute them while limiting the number released."

It was surprising how open she was, despite her usual secrecy.
Even the leading figures who were listening to the discussion were surprised, but that was because they were escaping from reality.
Even now, another Magus ace had been dropped. Their existence value was estimated to be over 500,000, but even such an ace-class knight could not buy enough time against Jahil.

Aside from Jahil, there were other notable generals in the enemy's camp.
Zalario went without saying.
His subordinates, Dhalis and Nice, had also achieved remarkable results in the battle. They had taken physical form as undead elves and had destroyed the Magus with great power.

"That's a big loss," Elmesia unintentionally grumbled.

The survival of the nation was more important than money. They had to somehow hold on until reinforcements arrived, and that would be difficult as things currently were. Such calculations only made her feel like complaining.

"I guess we'll just have to make do," Silvia said with a resigned look on her face.

Incidentally, the most powerful force in all of Sarion were the mother and daughter duo of Silvia and Elmesia. The reason they were standing by was because they had been recalled by the elders.

"You mustn't, Your Majesty! Silvia-sama, please be careful."

"It is as he says. Regardless of the chances of winning, this time we are up against too much of an opponent. It is absolutely unacceptable."

Even the elders had come out and interfered with the two of them.
It was out of concern for their safety.
Few people knew that Silvia was Elmesia's body double behind the scenes. In fact, even the thirteen royal families did not know about it.
And yet, this time, the appearance of the two at the same time created chaos at the scene. Even so, the strength of the two could not be compared to the Magus, who controlled the magitech knights, and they had succeeded in temporarily restoring the situation.

All the Magus had sortied and were doing their best to buy time. The reason for this was to let Silvia, Elmesia, and other important people escape.
If the two returned to the battlefield, the warriors' efforts would have been in vain.
However, even so:

"Frankly, it's not in our nature to run away alone."

"I agree with Mama. I'm afraid Rimu-chi will make fun of me later, so I guess I'll do my best too."

The two of them had already made up their minds.

"Your Majesty!!"

One of the elders cried out with a desperate look on his face. A long time ago, he had been the minister who sent Laplace---Sarion---into battle.
Since that time, he had always regretted it. He vowed never to do the same thing again, and this time he was doing his best to protect their beloved Elmesia.
However, Elmesia showed the face of a ruler and asked back:

"Who am I?"

When posed with this question, he had to answer as an elder.

"You are Her Majesty the Emperor."

"Is there anyone who shall stand in my way?"

The minister wept in his heart, thinking that it was cowardly to wield power at a time like this. However, he understood that this was Elmesia's way of life, and there was nothing he could do to stop her now that things had come to this point.

"That cannot be."

He had no choice but to say so and bow his head.
The Minister---now that the current elder had given his approval, there was nothing else the rest of them could do.
The leaders of the thirteen royal families must also fulfill their kingly duties.
As the foremost subordinates of the emperor, they were entrusted to lead the people according to her orders.

"Eh, Your Majesty---"

"Elalude-chan. Elen-chan will be protected by Rimu-chi, so please protect everyone."

"I, as well---I will accompany Your Majesty as well!"

"Hmm, I'm afraid it will be a hindrance. It's true that Elalude-chan is one of the leaders of the Magus, but he's just going to die in vain."

It was not Elmesia but Silvia who objected to the idea.
From Elalude's point of view, they were new acquaintances, but from Silvia's point of view, he was her beloved husband's younger brother. Even when she had pretended to be Elmesia, they had met several times.
That is why she rejected him coldly.
Elise Grimwald, Elmesia's grandmother and Elalude's mother, nodded in agreement.
In her capacity as the head of the thirteen royal families, she ordered Elalude, the archduke.

"Refrain, Elalude. Listen to the other kings."

Although normally calm and composed, she declared this in a voice full of dignity.

"Do not be selfish, follow Her Majesty's will."

It was an overwhelming pressure.
The other kings, inner feelings aside, could not help but nod their heads in agreement.

"But Mother---"

Elalude still tried to argue but was silenced by Elise's stare.
It was the first time Elalude had ever seen his mother's genuinely angry expression.
One of the kings admonished Elalude.

"If Elise-sama had not stopped you, you would have been detained."

An older member of the royal family, who had long since given up the throne to his sons, tapped Elalude on the shoulder and spoke to him.

"Give it up. Silvia's been in seclusion since your big brother, that rascal Sarion, disappeared. It's no wonder you don't know how scary she is---but, ah, she's even scarier than Her Majesty."

"Yes, yes. We're no match for her even if we all teamed up. It's best to obey her orders and make a run for it."

It was an unspoken rule in Sarion never to say that he was dead. It was a natural habit because no one wished to incur Silvia's wrath.

![break]

And so, everyone lamented their own helplessness.
Once again, they were depending on them for their survival.
But if this was the wish of the emperor, it was the duty of the subjects to obey.
Even the young kings, seeing their elders, came to realize this.
There was no use in resisting.

At the same time, they were surprised to learn that Sarion was actually a monolith.
The parents' and grandparents' generations, who usually seemed to be at odds with each other, were talking to one another amicably. It was the first time for them to witness such a situation, but it was so natural that it didn't feel like they were lying.
Everyone was convinced that it was due to Silvia's and Elmesia's charisma.

Silvia was a spear master who wielded the vajra with her Ultimate Skill 'Thunder King Indra', the highest level of the weather system.
Her daughter, Elmesia El-Ru Sarion, also had a different facade from that of the emperor of the Sorcerer's Dynasty of Sarion. She had awakened to the Ultimate Skill 'Heavenly Wind King Vayu^[Like Indra, Vayu is another deity in Hindu mythology (I sense a theme coming...). Vayu is known as the god of air, winds, and breath/life. Vayu is also considered to be a sibling of Indra.]', the highest level of the weather system that appeared to have been split off from Silvia. She was a genius in battle, slicing her enemies to pieces by freely manipulating a mythical-grade chakram.
Although Elmesia's ability was inferior to Silvia's, it was not far behind.

Once again, the two returned to the battlefield with everyone's wishes on their backs.
And with that, the result was finding a way out.

*Heaven helps those who help themselves.* Through their courageous actions, hope would continue to lead uninterrupted into the future.


![soft scene break]


Benimaru, Souei, Leon, Kagali and Teare arrived in Sarion sometime after Silvia and her team had returned to the battlefield.
They had only appeared in the images of the Control Room after their second sortie. Therefore, they were already exhausted.
The wounded seemed to be receiving medical treatment on the leaves of the giant Sacred Tree.
Silvia and Elmesia were facing off against Jahil and Zalario respectively. The defense mechanism of the Sacred Tree was working, which was the only reason why everyone had not died.

"As expected of Rimu-chi, you really sent us reinforcements just when I thought it would be too late..."

Elmesia greeted Benimaru and the others with emotion.

"Rimuru-sama always keeps his promises."

Benimaru smiled and nodded, staring at Zalario and Jahil.
Leon flew in front of Zalario to replace Elmesia. The Flame Pillar in his hand shone, giving off a strong presence.
Before he knew it, Souei was sneaking up behind Zalario.
Everyone was floating around the Sacred Tree to engage in aerial battles, so it was no surprise that Souei was floating in the sky as well.
Although it was two against one, the combination of Leon and Souei was at a disadvantage in terms of the difference in strength. However, Souei did not care about the fairness, and he was prepared to make a surprise attack without any hesitation.

On the other hand, as for Jahil...

"I won't forgive you."

Saying that, Kagali floated next to Silvia. At their level, they could create footholds in the air as well as on the ground.

*Ah, they aren't going to replace me,* thought Sylvia, but she could still fight if she tried hard enough, so she was thankful for their cooperation.

"How impertinent..."

Jahil gritted his teeth, and Teare glared at him as if challenging him.
The three of them surrounded him in a three-on-one formation, and the battle was about to begin.
Benimaru grasped the battle situation from a bird's eye view.
With the exception of the generals Jahil and Zalario, the Magus's strength was the most outstanding in battle. They had quickly recovered and began to push back the phantom's forces.

*Now then, if we can defeat Jahil and the others, we will be victorious.*

Even knowing that it would not be easy, Benimaru read the battle situation with a fearless smile on his face.

![break]

Despite his usual expressionless face, Leon, who confronted Zalario, was in a bad mood.
Leon was easily misunderstood.
He was not a good talker, and even his well-meaning actions were often the cause of resentment.
The few people who understood Leon were Silvia, his mentor, and Elmesia, whom he considered to be his ally.
To torment both of them to this extent was the second most offensive act to Leon.

By the way, it went without saying that the first-place spot was awarded to Chloe.
Be that as it may, there were other reasons for his anger this time.
He couldn't forgive himself for being dominated by the enemy as they pleased, and he couldn't forgive himself for causing trouble to Silvia because of it.

He had wanted to take out Michael, the cause of the trouble, with his own hands. But it seemed that Rimuru beat him to the punch, and he felt bad for owing Silvia a debt he could not repay.
If he did not repay the favor here, he would never be able to hold his head high.

Silvia alone had been enough. Moreover, this time, Leon was sure that this was not just a problem for Silvia and her comrades.
Velzard's purpose was unknown, but it appeared that she was on her way towards them while fighting with Milim. If they were caught in the aftermath of the battle with Milim, this place could easily be obliterated.
Leon did not think that would be the end.

From here, if you go north from Sarion, there was no obstacle in the north to reach the Western Nations where mankind was thriving. Towards the west was the Desert of Death, and beyond that was the Holy Void Damargania. And if you headed a little further southwest, you would reach El Dorado, Leon's domain.

Although Velzard's intentions were unknown, there was no doubt that one of these places would be targeted.
If it was just Velzard, he could take countermeasures against her, whatever her intentions may be. However, with Milim running amok, it would be extremely difficult to interfere in any way.
Was this Velzard's will or Feldway's strategy?

*Whatever it is, we just have to stop it.*

That was Leon's determination.
Leon's credo was to make swift decisions and to punish even the questionable.
In this case, it was up to Rimuru and his team to stop Velzard and Milim, but there was no doubt that Sarion was one of the most important lines of defense.
The fact that this place was under attack was proof enough, and as a result, it was necessary to eliminate the enemy generals before Milim and the others arrived. That way, they could deal with Milim's rampage with their undivided strength.

Of course, it would be suicide to fight directly, but it would be possible to reduce the damage by making them change their direction. He could not let them go toward El Dorado, nor could he let them threaten the sphere of existence of mankind.

*The best might be to lead them to the Barren Lands.*

Although he felt sorry for Dagruel, Leon thought this would be the best option. For that reason, he would not allow himself to be distracted.

"Hmph, taking advantage of Milim's outburst, how very shrewd of Feldway."

Leon thrust the tip of his sword at Zalario while speaking to him.
Leon's fighting style was similar to that of fencing. He was skilled at a brilliant technique that mainly consisted of sword thrusts.
Some people might think that fencing is a style of swordsmanship for dueling and not suitable for actual combat, but that was not the case. The most powerful of all sword techniques is the thrust. If you miss your attack, your posture will collapse and you will be left defenseless---this was the great risk and the reason why it could not be used frequently, but Leon's swordsmanship overcame this weakness. Similar to Silvia's spear technique, Leon was able to avoid being pursued by attackers by combining his technique with high-speed body techniques.

On top of this, Leon's power was specialized in speed, and his weapon, Flame Pillar, was of mythical-grade quality.
In a serious fight, Leon did not rely on his golden circle shield, called Gold Circle. Combined with the fastest speed that disregarded defense and the most powerful swordsmanship technique that focused on a single point, Leon was also called the flash hero.
In addition, Leon was able to manipulate spiritrons at will with his Ultimate Skill 'Purity King Metatron'. This enabled him to perform the most powerful 'Disintegration' repeatedly, and no one had the means to stop him.
This is the reason why Leon was called the strongest.
In terms of existence value, Leon was far behind Zalario. However, in terms of combat ability...

Leon's efficient fighting style was well-suited to compete with Zalario.
A warrior understood a warrior.
Zalario had also acknowledged Leon.

"They said they were after Veldora's dragon factor, but I really don't know what they are thinking. Velzard is also acting on her own, so I would like an explanation."

He was speaking honestly from the heart.
In fact, Zalario has not been given any explanation.
He was waging a war to overthrow Sarion under Feldway's orders.
Jahil also wanted Luminas, but he was included in the operation.

*Since they are willing to go to such lengths, there must be a reason for them to take this land...*

There was no work more uninspiring than being forced to work without understanding the logic behind it. Putting aside the low-level soldiers who were expected to act as cogs in the wheel, Zalario thought this was an unpleasant way to treat a general.
It was because he was unable to resist Michael's control that he was willing to accept such treatment. However, Zalario, who had always been looking for an opportunity, got the chance to be released the moment Michael disappeared. Since then, he had been analyzing the system little by little and was almost ready to be released.
Since he was not obliged to explain it all, Zalario changed the subject.

"So then, Leon. Are you going to play with me? Or you, sneaking around behind my back, do you want me to deal with both of you at the same time?"

Zalario glanced at Benimaru and saw that he was not going to make a move. It's not that he was looking down on Zalario and the others, but he probably intended to distribute his forces appropriately on the battlefield.
That decision was tantamount to underestimating them, but it did not matter to the unmotivated Zalario. He could not disobey orders, so he would just let it slide.
Souei knew that his presence would be noticed because unlike Jahil, Zalario seemed to be on his guard.

Although Jahil was more threatening in terms of existence value alone, Benimaru's conclusion was that Zalario was more troublesome. Souei agreed with Benimaru's conclusion. Therefore, he did not intend to take Zalario by surprise, but was prepared to support Leon.

"If it's known, it's too early to talk about it. I don't have the leeway either, so we have to justify every action in order to win."

Souei proudly declared his intention to "cheat."
Leon had no objections to this.
It was meaningless if you lost, so it was only natural to aim for victory by all possible means.
Thus, the battle against Zalario began with Leon taking the lead and Souei assisting him.


![soft scene break]


Against Jahil, a three-way attack was launched by three people.
Silvia launched a lightning speed spear attack with her Vajra.
Kagali was firing long-range magicule bullets. The power was controlled with the Ruin Scepter where a mass of mana was refined and launched.
Teare was in the foremost position, acting as the diversion.
Although this was the most dangerous role, Teare was not afraid. She was angry with her whole body, raging on behalf of Footman.

"I hate you! Die!!"

"Shut up! Damn cockroaches who have no choice but to flock together, don't joke around!!"

"You're the one who's being annoying."

Teare retorted, throwing the scythe in her hand like a boomerang. It was a weapon given to her by an ogre called Kurobee before her departure.
It had a presence so ominous that it seemed to be the highest level of legendary-grade, or even mythical-grade. Teare intuitively knew that it was much better than her own broken scythe.
The scythe was called the "Tear Scythe".

Kurobee had told her that it was a scythe that reaped tears, not lives.
Teare thought that it was the perfect weapon for her.
She would have to end her sadness this time.

The Tear Scythe ripped through the air towards Jahil as if it had a will of its own.
At the same time, she rapidly improved her physical ability and approached Jahil at once. She dove at Jahil's chest and delivered a powerful punch. Then she quickly broke away and caught the scythe as it spun back around.
And then, as if nothing had happened, she maintained her position to protect Kagali.
This was a fact made possible only because she was controlling her own body with the Unique Skill 'Manipulator'.

Teare's Unique Skill 'Optimist' could only be activated under the vague and specific condition of "when she receives an order". This was because Teare's ego was weak and fluffy.
However, upon being given a piece of Clayman---the "information particle" that made up the "heart core"---Teare changed.
She became stronger.
She decided that she must protect Kagali in place of Laplace, who had disappeared, and Footman, who had been taken over.

.........

......

...

At that moment, someone called out to Teare.

![break]

<<If you accept, you will be given power.>>

![break]

It was a "voice" left by someone who was not here.
A sleeping Teare had been analyzed, and this had been planted in anticipation of her need for it.
It was to be able to respond when Teare desired power of her own will.
Of course, there was a price to pay.
But it had been paid in advance.
Teare's power had long been analyzed and determined to be harmless. Likewise, it was determined that it would not do any harm if integrated with Clayman's non-threatening power. It was planted in the spirit of service to strengthen her as much as possible while she was an ally.

*I'll take anything if you give it to me! I have to become strong!!*

Teare accepted without hesitation.
The change was completed quietly and swiftly within Teare.
Teare's Unique Skill 'Optimist' and the Unique Skill 'Manipulator' which had been reproduced from Clayman's "information particle", were combined to create the Ultimate Enchantment 'Optimistic Performer Orpheus'.
It was all the work of someone (Ciel).

.........

......

...

Thus, Teare was reborn according to her own will.

*Yeah! I understand, Clayman. I...we have to protect Kagali-sama!!*

Teare vowed.
And then Teare's power sprung forth. It was as if her late friend was helping her...

Her existence value of over 2,400,000, which had felt unmanageable, now felt unsatisfactory. By doubling the power needed at each moment, she would no longer be intimidated by the superior Jahil.

Jahil was not amused.

"Don't you dare mock me, you puppet freak!!"

An annoyed Jahil launched a huge fireball.
Aside from the super-fast Silvia, Kagali and Teare had no way of escape. Their souls should have been obliterated by the blow.
However, the figures of Kagali and Teare flickered and disappeared, reappearing a slight distance away.
This astonished even Jahil.

"What? You guys didn't have that kind of power...what the hell did you do?!"

Jahil carefully launched a fireball, trying to be sure this time.
The trick, which Zalario would have easily figured out, was as simple as deceiving a child. Benimaru was protecting Kagali and the others with his 'Heat Haze'.
Even Jahil realized it the second time, having been forced to suffer this by Benimaru many times before.

"What impudence!!"

He was easily enraged and launched a volley of fireballs at Kagali and the others in a fit of emotion. But this only played into Benimaru's hands.
Even though Benimaru had not dealt with Jahil directly, he was able to read into Jahil's thought and behavioral patterns to give Kagali and the others the best advice.
Therefore,

"Oops, there's an opening!!"

Upon saying that, Silvia's spear pierced Jahil.
It did not kill Jahil, but it did make Silvia feel a little better about the situation.
And Kagali, too.

The Ultimate Enchantment 'Domination King Melchizedek', the power given to her by Michael, had been taken away by Yuuki. Instead, Kagali, who was now free, had enhanced the Unique Skill 'Schemer' rooted in her soul and raised it to a level close to a near-Ultimate level.
Even so, no matter how excellent Kagali was, there was a limit to the level of non-divinity. It would be more abnormal for Kagali to be able to tamper with abilities at will like Ciel did.
Kagali had experienced this abnormality in a dream.

.........

......

...

The voice was clear.

![break]

<<If you wish, I can give you power.>>

![break]

This incomprehensible offer had been spoken to her in her sleep.
Needless to say, it was Ciel's work.
Ciel could do almost anything in the labyrinth.
Rather than a dream, it was a conversation within Kagali's subconscious. Ciel then offered her a contract.
In exchange for optimizing Kagali's power, she wouldn't be allowed to turn it against Rimuru.

Even if Kagali betrayed, the power would still be in Ciel's hands... It was a "two birds with one stone" proposal that combined both hobby and profit. Depending on one's point of view, it might even seem that only Ciel would benefit from the proposal.
But Kagali, who had been craving for power, agreed to the proposal.
She had thought it was just a dream and did not suspect that she was being cheated. This was a blunder for the normally cautious Kagali, but as long as she did not antagonize Rimuru, she would not suffer any disadvantage. For Kagali, there was no problem as she did not want to antagonize Rimuru for various reasons.

.........

......

...

And when she woke up, Kagali realized the presence of that power.
She understood it and now completely owned it.

"Give me back my Footman!!"

Kagali activated her power---the ultimate enchantment 'Book of Prophecy Agastya^[Agastya is an Indian sage of Hinduism. A noted recluse and revered scholar of languages, medicine, and etc.]'.
As if she could see into the future, her power predicted Jahil's movements. Seemingly able to make up for the gap in power, the joint attack was successful.
After all, it was the combination of Benimaru's judgment, Kagali's prediction, Silvia's action, and Teare's resolve. Even Jahil's evil power could not be overturned so easily.

Besides, Benimaru had fought against Jahil once before. When he first encountered Jahil, he had been flustered by the difference in power, but now he already understood the nature of Jahil's power.
If you understood it, you had nothing to fear.

Benimaru had inherited Rimuru's policy of never fighting a battle that could not be won. Therefore, the fact that Benimaru had come meant that he had a chance to win.
All the pieces of the puzzle---the fighting forces necessary for victory---were in place, and the moment of victory was just around the corner.
Unaware of this, Jahil barked out.

"So impertinent! You seem to have forgotten how terrifying I am."

Aiming at Kagali with a volley of fireballs, Jahil shouted as he hid himself in the aftermath of the explosion. Then, he used the explosion as a propulsive force to approach Kagali quickly.
He planned to kill Kagali first.
Targeting the weakest first was an ironclad rule, and Jahil's judgment was not wrong. However, it was too easy to read his thoughts and too easy to wait for that.
Everyone thought to themselves.

*No way, it's never been this easy to fight before,* thought Silvia.

I was aware of it, but Rimuru is not the only threat. They are a great help as allies, but I shudder to think of what would happen if they were our enemies---thought Kagali.
Teare, who was entrusted with the most dangerous role, felt a strong sense of security.
That's how excellent Benimaru's command truly was.

Although he was sometimes a wimp in front of Rimuru, he was a man with a sense of responsibility as a leader. Like Diablo, he became more dependable and hard-working when Rimuru wasn't around.
That's why Benimaru was now sharpening his nerves.
He was connected to those under his command through 'Telepathy Net', and through Benimaru's power---the 'Will Control' of 'Heat King Amaterasu'---all of them were able to work as if they were of one will.

The result was the reality that they were now more than equally able to compete with the far superior Jahil.
If Benimaru had been alone, it would have been impossible for him to win against Jahil. Because their powers were of the same lineage, he lacked the decisive power, so he could not win no matter what strategy was used.
As was before, he had no choice but to fight so as not to lose.
But now things were different.
They had Silvia, the decisive force.
They had Kagali, the safeguard.
They also had Teare for the perfect follow-up.
Benimaru's mindset was that he did not feel that he would lose.


![soft scene break]


Zalario looked at Jahil with a sideways glance and was a little surprised. Just by strength alone, he should have been superior to himself, but he was being overwhelmed by a lower-ranked opponent.

*Jahil is not a fool. He is arrogant, but he is not foolish enough to let his guard down. In other words, that man is superior.*

He understood this by glancing at Benimaru.
Although he was not directly involved in the battle's combat, he was always there to provide appropriate support at key points. Since Benimaru's power was of the same lineage as Jahil's, he appeared to be able to effectively neutralize his flame attacks.

The fire attribute was very powerful when it was focused, but its thermal efficiency decreased rapidly when it was deflected. The same was true in the case of Jahil, who launched superheated flame attacks by interfering with magicules through the dominance enhanced by his ability. It was natural that the focal temperature would decrease if the heat wave was directed in another direction.

It should not have been an easy task, but Benimaru appeared to be doing it with a nonchalant expression. Zalario was frankly impressed and felt that he was worthy of praise, even though he was an enemy.
Still, Jahil was far superior to Benimaru in terms of the amount of energy, and Benimaru would not be able to withstand a direct hit. No matter how strong the power of magicule interference was, there was nothing he could do if he was hit by uncontrollable energy.

*Hm, he seems to be doing a good job at avoiding such a situation, but isn't it about time that Jahil gets tired of it?* Zalario thought.

Jahil was a man known as the great sorcerer emperor. If he understood his current situation, he would realize that he would be in dire straits if he did not do something about Benimaru.

*But still, how impressive.*

It was no wonder that Zalario thought so.
Benimaru's guidance was truly skillful, and the explosions and impacts were just tremendous. At first glance, he appeared to be overwhelmed, which was the reason for the delay in Jahil's realization of the current situation.
And the coordination among their group was also efficient. Each of them was doing their role with great care.

Benimaru appeared to be directing all of this.
Benimaru himself was a warrior in his own right, but he showed greater talent as a general. Zalario secretly acknowledged Benimaru as a threat.

"You are underestimating me to look the other way while you are still dealing with me."

After the lightning-fast sword strikes clashed, Leon spoke in a calm manner.
He did not seem to be particularly angry, but simply spoke what he thought.
Zalario smiled wryly and replied:

"No, it's not like that. The skill-levels of both sides are on equal footing, so the one who is too hasty will be the loser."

Despite Zalario saying that, he was able to deflect Leon's sword with ease.
However, that did not mean that there was a lie in his words. It was difficult to distinguish between the two when one was a high-level swordsman.
The trajectory of a sword could be predicted from information such as the opponent's line of sight, body position, and the direction of their signs. If one was on such a level playing field, the victory or defeat would depend on how well they succeeded in their feints.
If that was the case, Zalario thought that it would be better to use conversations to keep things in check rather than trying to force a move and get injured.

The enemy was not just Leon, but also Souei, who was a troublesome ambush. He could not let his guard down even if the opponent was lower ranked. He would attack as if knowing when Zalario did not want to be attacked.
Existence value---it was a numerical value calculated by taking into account various things such as the elements making up the body, the amount of energy, various resistances, and so on...but after all, it was only a rough estimate.
In fact, just as Jahil, who specialized in power, could not catch up with his opponent who specialized in speed, a battle might turn out to be a toss-up if the two opponents are not well matched.

Zalario was well aware of such a truth.
He did not know their existence value, but he understood the strength of his opponents. On the other hand, he deeply understood from his years of experience as a warrior that if he judged everything just by that, he would be caught flat-footed.
Therefore, underestimating an opponent was out of the question. He had never let his guard down, even while he was fighting against Leon and Souei at the same time.
Leon had also recognized the nature of Zalario in a short period of time.

*He is a very troublesome opponent. It's really difficult to deal with him without creating any openings.*

Leon put his own situation on the shelf and thought about things.
If the enemy was careless, he could use his special attack, but it was unlikely that he would be able to do so with Zalario. No matter how good Leon was at one-hit-one-kill strategies, he would leave himself open whenever he unleashed his special technique. If he tried to avoid such a situation, he would not be able to avoid a long battle.

In such a case, the one who was inferior was at the disadvantage.
As for Leon, who was competing only due to his skill-level, he could foresee a future where he would be defeated.
In other words, Zalario's policy was correct.
Having read each other so far, their correspondence was in sharp contrast.
Zalario was calm and collected, but Leon was losing his composure little by little.
However, Leon was not alone.

"Calm down. Don't let the enemy's words deceive you."

Souei, who had stepped out of the shadows, whispered in Leon's ear. He then launched a seemingly reckless suicide attack on Zalario and was cut down with a single slash of the sword.
Needless to say, it was Souei's 'Clone'. However, since the attackers were able to launch a wave of attacks with a mixture of falsehood and fact, this worked surprisingly well.
Leon was the main slasher, but Souei took over whenever he got tired. By repeating this, they were able to continue the battle with as little wear and tear as possible.

Even for Zalario, this situation was not the best.

![break]

In the midst of the stalemate, a sudden change occurred.
Benimaru made a move.

"Your Majesty Elmesia, I have a favor to ask you."

Benimaru was talking to Elmesia, who had left the group to recover from fatigue.
Zalario listened in on the conversation without hesitation, thinking that he could afford to be relaxed even in the midst of battle.

"What is it?"

"Those knights over there, the Magus, right? I would like you to give up the command to me, even if only temporarily."

Zalario was immediately pulled into the conversation, thinking that it was a reckless thing to say.
Leon was also annoyed at this.
He felt ignored, though Leon was interested in Benimaru's story as well.

"Hah? That's kind of impossible---"

"I understand that it's impossible. However, it has been reported that Milim-sama will soon arrive. If we do anything and this continues, the damage to this region will be immeasurable, so I've been ordered to do whatever I can to stop it."

"Was that from Rimu-chi?"

"Yeah."

*Well then, it can't be helped,* said the look on Elmesia's face.

"Normally, this would never happen no matter how friendly we are, but if Rimu-chi is saying it, I guess it can't be helped."

"Like boss like subordinate, huh?" While muttering to herself, Elmesia summoned her group leaders.
Upon seeing this, Zalario thought to himself, *No, no, that's really not possible.*

"This is absurd."

"Well, that's Rimuru for you."

"To that extent?"

"Yeah. Frankly, I just don't understand."

For some reason, Zalario began to sympathize with Leon, who was supposed to be his enemy.
Still, Zalario thought to himself.
He wondered what that Benimaru guy was going to do while dealing with Jahil.
As he watched with interest, he noticed the group leaders complaining about the situation. It was a very natural reaction, but Elmesia threatened them into silence.
She appeared to be saying that it was a matter of life or death, and that Benimaru was doing something to prove it.
An image was projected in the air.
Apparently, Benimaru had projected a long-distance image into the sky through his own power.

"What is that?"

"It appears to be an application of mirage. Benimaru seems to have improved upon the surveillance magic, 'Argus' developed by Rimuru-sama."

For some reason, Souei explained the reason why.
Incidentally, the battle was still going on. Even now, the sword clashes were becoming even more intense, but there was still time to converse with one another.
Zalario's swordsmanship involved a strong sword that cut down his enemies with a single stroke.

Zalario's nemeses, the insectars, were covered with exoskeletons, so a normal sword would be damaged by repeated slashes. In order to prevent this from happening, Zalario had refined his technique to cut accurately at the enemy's weakest points.
Since time in the other world and the Cardinal World were different, Zalario felt as if he had been fighting for more than tens of billions of years. Despite this, his skill with the sword had plateaued because he specialized in the characteristics of insectar enemies. Nevertheless, some of them were unusually good fighters, so Zalario's strength had reached an unimaginable level.

Zalario's unwillingness to fight was the only reason why the battle with Leon and his group was successful.
Leon and Souei had also recognized Zalario's true strength the moment they had confronted him. Nevertheless, both of them were quite determined to chat with each other and explain the situation without panicking.

The video clip that appeared on the image projection showed Rimuru and his team in action.
Rimuru was facing Milim, and Guy was facing Velzard. Velgrynd was also there for some reason, and they were cooperating with each other so as not to cause further damage to the surroundings.

"I didn't expect Velgrynd to cooperate. As expected of Rimuru, his talent for manipulating others is terrifying."

"I'd rather you call it natural virtue."

Leon and Souei were arguing with each other, but Zalario couldn't care less.
He did not understand why Milim and the others were heading this way.
In the first place, it was not clear whether this was part of the plan or not.
Was Feldway planning something, or was this just a coincidence? There was also the possibility that Velzard was doing this on her own, but if that was the case, he couldn't imagine what she was trying to achieve.
But if this was Feldway's scheme...

*If Feldway had told Velzard something, this situation is also possible. In that case, what is the purpose?* Zalario thought to himself.

Milim and Velzard had been fighting, but this was done in a way that Velzard was able to stop Milim from going out of control. If Velzard set her sights on other targets, her hands would be free.
Milim would then go to the limit of her destructive power, and Guy would most likely move to stop her.
That was exactly what Velzard was aiming for.

Guy would not be able to afford to fight against Milim. She would take advantage of the situation and make Guy do her bidding.
It was easy to read that far, so he didn't think Guy would simply show up to the fight. It was only natural that he would bring along a collaborator, and it made sense that it was the Demon Lord Rimuru.
That much was understandable.
The problem was what came after that.

*It is obvious that Velzard's target is Guy. But if so, there is no point in moving to a different location. In that case, I should assume that Feldway's intentions are involved, but...*

Zalario, who had inferred up to that point, was now troubled.
Why would they bother to come all the way to Sarion, where they are already attacking?
To support Zalario's team?

*No, I don't think so. Hey Feldway, just what are you thinking?*

Zalario could not find an answer to his question and his frustration with Feldway grew.
This was something that should have been explained from the beginning.
If he didn't understand what was intended by leading Milim to this place, they might get caught up in the situation. If he didn't know whether they should cooperate or evacuate, they would be stuck.
That's what Zalario was thinking.

If the defending forces were only Silvia and Elmesia, Zalario and his men could easily take down Sarion. However, the situation was now in a stalemate because Demon Lord Rimuru had sent reinforcements.
It was weak reasoning to assume that they sent Milim after foreseeing such a situation. In that case, Zalario and the others should have begun their invasion after first hitting Milim to confuse the situation.
The fact that Milim would reach them only after the chaos was done would have made sense in that situation.
For example, precisely because no one could move, it would make sense to get in Milim's way.

With that thought in mind, Zalario turned his head to look behind him.
Standing there was the divine tree that had been standing upon this land since time immemorial.
The Sacred Tree, rooted in the earth and responsible for protecting the planet from all kinds of natural disasters, was still standing strong, even though it was exposed to the flames of Jahil.
In the past, the Sacred Tree had protected this land from the damage caused by the war between Milim and Guy.

In the north, there was Velzard.
Guy and Ramiris protected the human sphere ruled by Demon Lord Luminas.
The Nasca region guarded by Rudra was safe thanks to Velgrynd's cooperation.
However, the sanctuary of Damargania at the center of the damage, while it had not been destroyed because of Heaven's Tower, it still bore the scars of the devastation. Its former glory was still lost.
Even so, thinking about the other way around...

One could say that only so much damage had been done.
The world was protected by a god.
If one wanted to destroy the world, one would have to face many obstacles.

Guy, the mediator, was the best of them.
He was feared by mankind as the strongest and most wicked demon lord, but he had kept his pact with Veldanava and continued protecting this world. As such, there were several beings who played a role in protecting the world. Those were the demon lords selected by Guy, including Ramiris, another mediator.
And then there were their counterparts, the heroes.

In particular, there was Masayuki, the reincarnation of the most powerful hero of all, Rudra, who was now leading with Velgrynd at his side.
Apart from them, the sacred relics influenced by the god's hand, such as the Heaven's Tower, would also be in the way.
One such relic was the Sacred Tree.

*Feldway's plan to revive Veldanava-sama has failed because of the loss of Michael. In that case, what would he be after next?*

Zalario felt a chill run down his spine.
Only two relics remained in this world: the Sacred Tree and Heaven's Tower. There was also the labyrinth created by Ramiris, but that should be considered as a separate category.
After that, there were only a few notable presences left that would get in the way.

The six of Guy, Rimuru, Chronoa, Masayuki, Velgrynd, and Veldora, most of whom had been neutralized.
Guy was being blocked by Velzard.
Rimuru had his hands full trying to deal with Milim's rampage.
Chronoa and Masayuki were free, but they were probably exhausted and would not be able to move for a while.
Velgrynd appeared to be working to protect the planet. She was no longer a threat, as she appeared to be using most of her strength.
And Veldora was now in Ramiris' labyrinth.

While it may seem that Veldora was on the defensive due to Feldway's attempts to kill him, on the contrary, it could be said that he was now stuck in the labyrinth.
In other words, if Feldway's target was as Zalario expected, his situation was steadily improving.

![break]

*This is bad,* Zalario thought.
To be honest, Zalario had no desire for destruction. His true feelings were that if he was going to die, he alone should die. He had no intention of being involved in the destruction of the world, no matter how good a friend he was.
In the first place, Zalario was thinking that he should stop this foolishness because he was a friend.

*I don't know if I am right or not, but I should assume as such and act accordingly.*

Even if he was wrong, he could just say that the person who did not explain things was at fault. Zalario concluded in this way and began to change his mindset about what he should be doing from here on.
Then he looked around and noticed that Benimaru was leading the Magus in an imposing manner.
*Well done,* Zalario was impressed.

*He is playing his cards right against Jahil, but on the other hand, he is not neglecting his preparations for the coming natural calamity.*

In this respect, Jahil looked like the smaller person.
As for Zalario, who did not like Jahil, it was enough to give him a favorable impression of Benimaru.
*Then it's settled,* Zalario had decided.

![break]

Zalario spoke to Leon and the others.

"As you know, I am deprived of my freedom. I have regained enough control to be able to say what I think, but there is still Michael's control."

"...What are you trying to say?"

"If you've been through something similar, then you'd understand what I'm trying to say, wouldn't you?"

"Hm. You're asking me to help free you."

"It's good that you're so quick on the uptake."

In a casual tone, Zalario brought up a certain proposal...


![soft scene break]


Benimaru had taken control of the Magus.

.........

......

...

Even though Elmesia gave permission, the knights were dissatisfied.
It was only natural.
Benimaru could understand their frustration of why they had to be used by someone from another country.
However, now was not the time to talk about such things.
It was because he understood this that Elmesia had lent him the command, and why Duke Elalude reluctantly showed his willingness to obey.
The knights who were members of the order were of the super elite and held titles, but even they had to follow suit here because if they tried to act up, they would be exposed to Milim's fury and be destroyed in an instant.

*As expected, Milim-sama is terrifying. The topography of the Coscia Mountains has already been changed, and if things continue as they are, this place will also be destroyed in the same way. I must do my best to prevent that from happening.*

Benimaru was determined.
Rimuru's order was a simple one; predict the course of the attack and somehow change it.
If things continued on their present course, the attack would directly affect the Sacred Tree that protected the royal city of Sarion.

Rimuru had not sounded confident with his words, but Benimaru knew. He knew that Rimuru's predictions were never wrong in such a situation.
He had said to evacuate everyone in case of a worst-case scenario, but they should first try their best.

The key was the Magus.
Rimuru said that if they attacked Milim with all of their combined power, they might be able to distract her, even if only for a moment.
He said that the possibility of defeating Milim was yet to be discussed, so there was no need to worry about injuring her.

*No one is worried about that...*

Benimaru smiled wryly.
Then, bracing himself, he raised his voice to the knights Elalude was trying to persuade.

"Listen up! If we do nothing, an unprecedented crisis will come upon this land. I have orders from my lord Rimuru-sama to stop it! You may not have the obligation to go along with this, but you must obey now. Otherwise, your homeland will be reduced to rubble!"

Benimaru did not intend to threaten them, but only spoke the truth.
If they failed to follow Rimuru's instructions here, Sarion would almost certainly be destroyed. Of course, Benimaru himself was not going to give up even if the Magus did not follow the order. He was going to do his utmost to save lives by helping with the evacuation, and after that, he was going to join Rimuru.
Jahil was nothing but a mere obstacle to Benimaru. Kagali, Teare, and Silvia alone would be enough to defeat him, but with Benimaru's support, the level of difficulty was such that it could be done with a single hand.
Therefore, Benimaru wanted to prepare for the coming threat.

In any case, he was waiting for the reply.
Benimaru used his own ability to project an image in the mid-air in order to convey the situation quickly.
As Souei explained to Zalario, Benimaru reproduced the image from a long distance by using his own power, 'Heat King Amaterasu'.
This technique, which was developed by Benimaru with reference to mirages, was very useful in outdoor operations.
If the situation of Milim's group was projected on the display, it would be more convincing. Benimaru thought as such, but it turned out to be a more terrifying scene than he had expected.

The mere sound of Milim's roar was enough to destroy the mountains and rivers.
Water dried up and rocks crumbled.
Rimuru was trying desperately to calm her down, but to no avail. While working with Velgrynd to avoid causing any unnecessary damage, he could only try to contain Milim's attacks as best he could.

*No, that's not it. It's because Rimuru-sama is distracting Milim-sama that the damage is only this small...*

Rimuru was taking all of Milim's attention and Velgrynd was preventing the aftermath. It was natural for Rimuru to become desperate. In that case, Rimuru should have been able to redirect Milim, but that was also impossible. Milim's attacks were like a torrent, so while they could be withstood and deflected, it was impossible to change the directions themselves.

*Is he just trying not to worry us, or is there another reason?*

In any case, Benimaru had only one task to fulfill.

*It means that if we can divert her attention for just a moment, we might be able to change its course. I'll do it.*

Benimaru took a deep breath.
Failure would be a disaster. Worst case scenario, it could be the end of the world.
It was a bad gamble, but he decided to trust Rimuru, as he always did, because it was the only way to win.
Benimaru was fine with all this, but the Magus were not so lucky.
It was impossible for them not to be upset upon being shown such a scene.
In such a situation, Benimaru, who was standing tall, was at the center of attention.

Elmesia opened her mouth as the Magus became silent: "Once again, I entrust the command of the Magus to Benimaru-dono. Does anyone have any objections?"

Elmesia asked this question with a hint of intimidation, but no one objected.

*Well, of course. As expected, there are no idiots who would still complain after being shown something like that...*

If Elmesia had seriously given the order, all of them would have obeyed Benimaru at the risk of their lives. But then, there might have been people who had worked without understanding what they were being asked to do, and without relieving their dissatisfaction.
Benimaru did not think that far ahead, but he ended up settling this in the best possible way.

.........

......

...

With no time to lose, Benimaru gave orders one after another.
Even though he was dealing with knights of another country, he did not hesitate to be bold.
Contrary to popular belief, many people seemed to find Benimaru's boldness to be reliable, and his reputation unintentionally began to rise rapidly.
Thus, the preparations proceeded steadily.


![hard scene break]


As we approached Sarion, I saw a huge tree.
It was still far away, but clearly visible. It made me understand just how big this Sacred Tree was.
But still, no matter how big it is, it would be no match for Milim's fury. The power of Milim was so overwhelming that I was convinced of it.
I had already seen so much on the way to this place.
The only reason why this planet was still safe was because of Velgrynd-san's offer to help us.
She came all the way to here because she was worried that our planet would be thrown into chaos if things continued.

If the world collapsed, even Velgrynd-san would be in trouble, so I shouldn't really need to thank her that much, and even if that did happen, she could just escape with 'Dimension Leap'. As for me, I accepted her offer of cooperation gratefully.
Apparently, a 'Split Body' had been left with Masayuki, so her current strength was only about 70 percent. Even so, she was helping out a lot, so I could rely on her.
This is why I always end up being spoiled.

"This might be a dumb question, but are you able to protect the Sacred Tree from being damaged?"

I took a risk and asked Velgrynd-san.
The result was as expected.

"You're still the same idiot as ever. Milim doesn't seem to be taking things seriously, yet I'm still doing everything I can to maintain the 'Star Barrier'. Despite this, Milim is able to control stardust. There is no 'Barrier' in the world that can take her Drago Nova head-on."

Velgrynd-san gave me a cold stare, as if in a bad mood.


![full page image](image12.jpg){Velgrynd looking like she is about to smack Rimuru with her fan.}


I wish I hadn't said anything unnecessary, but the destructive power of a beautiful woman's side-glance still made my heart pound.

"But you know, I heard that Drago Nova was also reflected---"

"That's because Milim was holding back. Stardust cannot be reflected, so it's useless to expect anything."

Ah, I see...

Or rather, so Milim really was in control of her power. But well, it was only natural that she couldn't go all out since she risked destroying the planet while trying to annihilate the enemy forces.
However, Milim was now in a state of frenzy.
It was a mistake to expect her to take things easy on us.
In that case, we had to somehow break the order given to Milim before the serious Milim unleashes a Drago Nova.
So, what is to be done?

Ciel-san's plan was to gather all possible forces and attack Milim in waves to turn her attention towards them. In the meantime, I would neutralize Feldway's power and cancel the order he had given.
In fact, Milim was being controlled by Feldway's power, but it was not perfect. Ciel-san confidently assured me that I could break the control.
To be precise, it would be Ciel-san, not me, who would break the control...but in order to succeed, Milim's consciousness had to be distracted. That's why I couldn't accomplish this by myself.

I had thought that Velgrynd-san could deal with Milim while I took that opportunity to release the order, but now I was told that the aftermath could cause a catastrophe on the earth if that were to happen. Velgrynd-san came here without me asking her to, so I understood that this was to be expected.
If it were possible, I would have liked to be a target and take action to minimize the damage. However, it was impossible to do so, and it was a very reckless strategy that was difficult to estimate how much damage would be caused.
Moreover, the success rate is not that high---

![break]

<<Good news. I have found a factor that may increase the probability of success.>>

![break]

*Oh?*
I hate bad news, but I love good news.

![break]

<<I have confirmed the presence of Demon Lord Leon and Zalario in the vicinity of our destination. Since this is very convenient, I would like to ask them to cooperate with us. Can you give me your permission?>>

![break]

Of course, that's fine, but will they help us?
Leon aside, Zalario seems to be an ally of Feldway...

![break]

<<No problem. They will certainly cooperate with us.>>

![break]

I don't know where Ciel-san's confidence is coming from, but in a situation like this, I had no choice but to leave it to its thing. I gave my permission without thinking.

It was not long after that I found out what the results would be.


![hard scene break]


What Zalario suggested was to have Leon and Souei attack him at full power, putting a burden on himself. He wanted to find out how Feldway's 'Ultimate Dominion' worked while he was exercising his full strength.
Leon had also been under Feldway's control, but now he seemed to have been released. He was not sure what would happen if the power was used again, but that is why he thought that he could get a chance to escape from this situation by examining it.
Leon also responded to this.

Enviably, in Leon's case, it appeared that Demon Lord Rimuru had sealed the 'Domination Circuit' that was built into an Angelic Skill.
Unfortunately, that did not help with testing Zalario, but it was worth attempting the strategy of applying a burden. That's why they decided to go ahead with the plan.
That's when it happened.
A strange voice was heard.

![break]

<<I have heard your story. If you wish, I will recreate the power of the angelic system so that you will not be influenced by anything.>>

![break]

This proposal came out of the blue from an unknown party; an absurd story when you thought about it.
There was no way they could simply nod "yes" to such a suspicious proposal.
Leon and Zalario looked at each other awkwardly.
What to do---the two looked at each other and understood that it was not the other party's work.
Both of them were wondering what should be done.

Leon recognized that this was Rimuru's doing.
It was ridiculous even imagining what kind of method he had used.

*It wouldn't be strange for him. In that case, it's a good idea to leave it to him.*

Leon made his decision.
To begin with, he was easily able to mess with the 'Domination Circuit' built into other people's abilities, so probably anything could happen. It was as if he were advertising that his powers were bullshit without even trying to hide it.
Not only Leon, but the other demon lords were also unanimous in their opinion that "Rimuru is a load of bull".
In Rimuru's opinion, he was being extremely misunderstood, but he was just as guilty of letting Ciel do as it pleased, so he had no reason to complain.

Zalario, on the other hand, was in a state of confusion.
On the surface, he was calm and maintained his appearance as a warrior. However, Zalario's inner self was in turmoil.

*How did you do that? How can you speak directly to my heart like that?!*

Zalario had never experienced such direct communication with his heart before.
Leon ignored it, but the earnest Zalario was caught in the middle of it.
If it had been Leon's work, he would have assumed that it was a direct thought attack. However, Rimuru was not present. This was an impossible phenomenon according to Zalario's experience and common sense.
And that was not all.

Zalario, naturally, had put up a psychological barrier to prevent any and all kinds of mental attacks. Since Zalario was a mental organism to begin with, the defense of his heart core was ironclad.
Furthermore, it would be unthinkable, even with common sense, for someone else to modify another's Ultimate Skill, which was closely related to the desire of the individual.

*I don't understand. Is it even possible in the first place?*

It was hardly possible, but the voice did not sound as if it was trying to deceive him with a lie.
Zalario was willing to put himself in danger to gain his freedom.
And yet, the voice made an incomprehensible offer, as if it were so simple.
It was so funny that he couldn't help but laugh.

<What's the catch? What's in it for you if I accept your offer?> Zalario inquired, understandably.
The voice answered:

![break]

<<I would like to ask for a little help. It's a very simple job, so just follow my instructions and attack with all your might.>>

![break]

It was a very suspicious answer, making it sound like there was no catch at all, which made it even more suspicious.
On the other hand, he found it strangely refreshing.

<All right. I'll accept your offer.>

And Zalario agreed.
With that, the contract was binding.

![break]

<<Subject's acceptance confirmed. Now executing 'Skill Alteration'.>>

![break]

The change was dramatic and instantaneous.
From this point on, the mysterious voice---Ciel---took the center stage.
Leon's power---the Ultimate Skill 'Purity King Metatron'---was modified into the Ultimate Skill 'Light King Surya^[Surya is a Hindu god of the sun and ruler of the planets. Considered a sibling to others such as Indra, Vayu, etc.]' with an improved performance.

Zalario's Ultimate Skill 'Judgement King Israfil'^[In Muslim tradition, Israfil is the angel of music who will sound the trumpet on the judgment day.] was also modified into the Ultimate Skill 'Retribution King Metis' by Ciel.


![hard scene break]


Ciel-san informed me that the pawns had been successfully secured.
It seems that Leon and Zalario agreed to cooperate with us.
That was an incomprehensible story.
Leon is still good, but isn't Zalario an enemy?
What is going on here?

![break]

<<It was really easy. 'Analyze and Assess' was done on 'Justice King Michael', which contains the 'Ultimate Dominion' that allows absolute control over angelic Skills. I just used it.>>

![break]

So, there was such a cheat technique.
It's annoying when used by enemies, but so reliable when used by allies...

Or rather, it's so amazing that I can't help but feel it's a bit of a letdown.
Ciel-san interfered with Leon and Zalario through its power and concluded a negotiation. At that time, it had apparently played with their abilities just for the sake of it, so I wondered whether I should praise its hobby to that extent.

![break]

<<Ufufu, thank you very much! ♪>>

![break]

No, I haven't praised you yet, though?
I was rather dumbfounded, but Ciel-san seemed happy, so I kept quiet.

*Anyway,* it's a happy miscalculation that we have increased our strength.
Leon and Zalario have maintained the status quo. They are pretending to be fighting and waiting for further instructions from Ciel-san.
I, on my part, contacted all parties concerned to be prepared for such an eventuality.
I would keep close communication with Benimaru to avoid even the slightest error.
Benimaru seems to be playing a role of assisting the battle against Jahil, but he said not to worry about that either. Not only Silvia-san, but also Kagali and Teare were fighting together to corner Jahil.

It seems that this situation has been made possible by the fact that Benimaru, who is in the same power lineage as Jahil, has been directing the strategy to exploit Jahil's weakness.
Compatibility really was important, because Benimaru alone could not have won the battle.
I was relieved that Benimaru was in good hands, so I would keep an eye on the others.

I explained the situation to Souei and told him to cooperate with Leon and Zalario when the time came. I even explained the situation to El-tan, who was also connected to the 'Telepathy Net'. I had given her an outline of the plan and asked for it to be conveyed to the Magus as well.
Benimaru's command alone would be sufficient, but now I felt even more secure.

![break]

By the way, I was very surprised when I saw the Magus for the first time. It reminded me of an armored robot like those in cartoons.
It was as if they shared the same senses with each other, but their huge bodies of less than 5 meters were, in my opinion, those of a robot's.
I would study this later during peacetimes.

Now that there was such a fun opportunity, I had to make this mission a success.
If we failed here, Sarion would be reduced to ashes.
I tightened my resolve once again and continued to observe Milim.
She was still cloaked in a tremendous haki and showed no signs of fatigue.
Even now, her power was unfathomable, but what was truly frightening was that her presence seemed to be growing little by little.

That Milim was growing stronger even under these circumstances.
No, to be precise, she was releasing the power that had been suppressed.
Whether it was a matter of existence value or not, I was sure that she was better than Michael whom I had just defeated.
Just thinking about fighting such a thing head-on made me shudder.
But it had to be done.
The time of the final battle was near.
I would be ready for anything, thinking of every possible countermeasure in anticipation of every possible situation.


![hard scene break]


Zalario could not hide his confusion.
Even though he could feel it, he could not understand what happened to him,
*Now executing 'Skill Alteration',* he thought he heard a voice saying that, but shortly after, it felt as if the chains binding his heart core were shattered.
It was only Zalario's imagination, but he certainly felt it.
Because Feldway had inherited the power of 'Justice King Michael', Zalario had remained under his control. But now, he was released in an instant.

Although he had acquired the Ultimate Skill 'Judgement King Israfil', it was better to throw it away than to remain under his control. That's what he had thought, but for some reason, the power seemingly remained as it was. Now it seemed to be more convenient to use.
The performance of the Ultimate Skill 'Judgement King Israfil' was similar to backwards compatible 'Covenant King Uriel'. Although it compensated for what was lacking in some respects, the direction of its power was similar.

In other words, it was a power specialized in spatial management. It could manage the flow of any kind of matter and wavelengths within the area of influence.
The only exceptions were information particles and stardust.
In other words, not even Leon's signature spiritron attack, 'Disintegration', could penetrate Zalario.
Of course, if they had the same amount of energy, it could work, but the gap between Leon and Zalario was too large. If Zalario had been serious, he could even reflect Leon's spell.

However, Leon did not make use of any special moves of his own during this fight. This was because he hesitated to use them due to doubts about his power.
Therefore, although there were no big events, it was a fortunate event for both fighters.
Zalario's power had been reborn by Ciel.
Ultimate Skill 'Retribution King Metis', a destructive Skill that surpassed even the Ultimate Skill 'Covenant King Uriel', allowed one to freely manipulate any materials and wavelengths within the target space at will.

Although information particles and stardust could not be manipulated, it was a performance suitable for one of the strongest, as if it were specialized for combat.
Zalario understood it intuitively.

*I can't believe it. Why? I certainly accepted the offer, but I didn't say that I would be your ally...or rather, no, no, that was the problem before.*

It couldn't be helped.
An Ultimate Skill was something that was normally extremely difficult to acquire. It was so difficult that even Zalario, who had been alive for more than tens of billions of years, had just finally acquired it by himself.
He knew of its existence, but he thought he did not need it. Perhaps that was why he couldn't acquire it, but still.

*It is a fact that it is not easy to acquire. And yet you changed it so easily? Is that possible? Or rather, just who could do such a thing...*

Zalario was horrified at the thought of it.
The Ultimate Skill was a system made by the creator Veldanava to manage the world. It could be used as a substitute for the administrator's authority, but with a more specialized and convenient authority, it could be used as if one were a god.
Under certain conditions, it was even possible to resuscitate the dead.

*Is it possible to recreate such a power that could easily destroy even the providence of the world?*

Zalario shuddered.
It was a strange story from the start when he thought about it.

"Who the hell would do something like this," Zalario muttered under his breath, to which Leon replied, "Rimuru did it."

"Rimuru? Are you saying that Demon Lord Rimuru did this?"

"That's right. Don't think too hard about it. Just understand that that's the way it is."

*That's absurd,* Zalario thought.
However, seeing Leon's distant gaze, he guessed that he had been through a lot.

"You guys are being disrespectful to Rimuru-sama," Souei said with displeasure.

Apparently, he was angry that his master had been mocked, but Zalario was the one who wanted to say, *hold on a minute.*

"Your master is ludicrous!"

"Exactly."

Zalario involuntarily objected, and Leon nodded in agreement.
The two of them were a bit uncomfortable having unexpectedly hit it off.

"How's the confirmation of power?" Zalario asked Leon to change the subject.

"Don't underestimate me. I've got the feel for it," Leon answered.

In fact, Leon had taken the 'Light King Surya' as his own. He accepted it as if it had been his own power from the very beginning, without any sense of discomfort. Now Leon could interfere with spiritrons without any difficulty.
In fact, Leon was superior to Zalario in terms of basic skill-levels.

Zalario had a lot of experience as a fighter, but his enemies were uniform insectars, and he did not have the concept of training his skills. The same could be said of Obera, who fought the same opponents all the time; their techniques were optimized to suit their enemies. Once his sword reached the mythical-grade level, he was able to easily cut even the exoskeleton of his enemies, so his techniques were no longer being polished.

In that respect, although the time he had lived was incomparable to Zalario's, Leon was a Hero who had fought against numerous enemies. It was not surprising that Leon's experience was superior to that of Zalario's.
That is why, even though Zalario had been taking it easy on him, he was able to compete in the battle without using any of his powers against an overwhelmingly superior opponent.

"You haven't used your power in a long time, so will you be all right?" Zalario asked.

"No problem," Leon answered with a grin. "Now I can handle you without hesitation, what about you?"

Zalario couldn't help but smile wryly at Leon's attitude which was as if he was going to prove it to him.

"I'll do my best to deal with you later."

He dismissed the situation and turned his attention to Milim, who had now become visible.


![hard scene break]


I looked around at my friends waiting in the distance and confirmed that they were all ready.
As expected of Benimaru, his formation was superb.
With that, we could launch a wave of attacks on Milim without any waste.

Souei was also visible.
He was standing still in the air---or rather, he was floating in the air, but it still looked as sexy as ever.
Something like that was unnecessary in the middle of battle, but it didn't seem intentional, so I guess he couldn't stop it.

Anyway, Leon and Zalario were on both sides of Souei. They appeared to be getting along well with each other, so it seems that Ciel-san was right, and they had really agreed to cooperate with each other.
This was not so much Zalario's betrayal but rather Feldway's lack of virtue.

Well, it was a lifesaver in this case, so I have no complaints.
I would keep in mind that the question is what would happen after this matter was over.
Well then, I'll just leave that to Souei.

<Benimaru, final check, are things okay?>

<It's perfect. Leon-dono and Zalario-dono are now under my command, so there is nothing to worry about.>

I was satisfied with his confident answer.

![break]

The showdown was only a moment away.
We were approaching at a speed several tens of times faster than the speed of sound, so if we missed the first move, it was all over.

The time it would take for Milim to fire her Drago Nova would be shorter than the blink of an eye. All she had to do was to make a quick stop, get herself ready, and then shoot.

For those of us watching, it might seem like a long time, but in reality, it would only be about three seconds.
We couldn't attack Milim in flight, so we could only aim in that moment. We would direct Milim's actions by repeating a series of attacks, and then I would invoke 'Void God Azathoth' to remove Feldway's 'Regalia Dominion', which interfered with Milim's thoughts and actions.
Leon and Zalario would support me with their all-out attacks, so I think the success rate was above zero.

With a wave of attacks from the Magus and the aforementioned four---Benimaru, Souei, Leon, and Zalario---it was the strongest special attack. Even Milim would have to stop her movements and defend herself at least a little.
That was the outline of the plan.

Then came the decisive moment.
Milim was about to attack the Sacred Tree, and she stopped in the air.

![break]

The attack of the Magus had started.
As if it was a beautifully staged event, the beam cannons fired with a single, unrestrained movement.
Normally, I would have admired the scene, but this was not the time to do so.
I could see that the rays of light were a high-power heat ray equivalent to 'Nuclear Cannon'. It was a robot weapon that could shoot light beams in rapid succession; El-tan sure has a great hidden gem.
Well, let's get back to that some other time.

As expected, it was no match for Milim.
Benimaru's precise command had concentrated the light beams to a single point. The focal point temperature exceeded 100,000,000 degrees Celsius, and while it was very dangerous, it didn't seem to get through to Milim.
Because she was ignoring it without even taking a defensive stance.
It looks flashy, but does this attack have a purpose?

![break]

<<It was able to distract Milim and buy a little time.>>

![break]

*O-oh...*

It was almost pointless, but it sure did its job well.
Ah, Milim thrust both hands out in front of her.
She didn't seem to be distracted at all, and at this rate, nothing I do would work. At this point, I could only rely on the attacks of Benimaru and the others.

Souei made the first move.

"Thousand-Hand Shadow Kill."

Souei's shadow stretched out into a thousand arms to capture Milim.
But...

Even though Souei's power, the Ultimate Gift 'Moon King Tsukuyomi', was activated with all his might, Milim's movement was not even stopped for a moment.
Not to mention 'Insta-kill' would never work. It was as I had expected from the beginning, but unfortunately, it ended without getting Milim to pay attention for even a moment. Still, I knew that Souei was not the kind of person who would give up after that.
He himself made a move to pin Milim down with his own hands.

![break]

<<Don't worry. That is Souei's 'Split Body'.>>

![break]

Ah, that's right.
I was impressed by how convenient it was to use.
In this way, while Souei was unable to achieve the purpose of stopping Milim's movements, he had succeeded in slightly hindering those movements.
Then, as if to cover Souei, the ultimate destructive light danced wildly.

"Disappear as dust, 'Hundred Breaker'!!"

This was Leon's sure-kill technique.
Each and every light beam was so large that it could swallow a person, and Leon's 'Disintegration', which could change its trajectory at will, was the strongest technique imaginable.
Needless to say, Souei's 'Split Body' was instantly reduced to dust.
However...

Milim was unfazed.
From the moment Drago Nova was ready to be activated, an Invisible Barrier was generated to envelop Milim. She was clad in the shimmer of stardust and was able to completely block even spiritron attacks.
It was definitely better than Covenant King Uriel's 'Absolute Defense'^[Admittedly, that became a pretty low bar.].
Leon's sure-kill technique was so powerful that even I would have had a difficult time with it, but it ended without much effect.
However, the attacks did not end there.

Before the aftermath of Leon's attack, Zalario had already been on the move.

"Insanity Hash.'"

Zalario, who was the epitome of simplicity and fortitude, seemed to have accepted Benimaru's instruction without any resistance.
Since he agreed to cooperate, he probably had no intention of breaking that promise. He seemed to think that it was the duty of a soldier to obey his commander, even if it was an enemy. Although he had been on the enemy side, he was surprisingly trustworthy.
At the same time as Souei's attack, Zalario unleashed his move.

I don't know how he did it, but it was a technique that he had never shown even when he was fighting against Leon and Souei.
Zalario's mighty sword, which could even cut an alienium exoskeleton in two, had the power to kill just by swinging it. Now, it was aimed at Milim with the intent to kill.
Its existence value was no joke, estimated to be over 20 million.
With a denser sword force than Souei's and Leon's attacks combined, it was a lightning-fast blow to the point of stupidity.
However...

It made Milim's Invisible Barrier glow brightly, but that was all.
It was an unbelievable sight.
Any one of those attacks should have been too powerful to be underestimated. And yet, they did not seem to mean much to Milim---the simultaneous attack of the three of them seemed to have failed, but there was still one second left before Milim activated her Drago Nova.

And that was enough time for Benimaru.
Benimaru's mouth was set in a fearless smile, as if to show off his naturally combative nature.

<All right, here comes the real thing!>

Souei, Leon, and Zalario moved accordingly, though they did not actually say anything out loud.
It had been as planned from the beginning.
The red lotus that Benimaru held in his hand was shining with a beautiful red glow.
It was a terrifying red light that would burn away all matter, but it blended with Benimaru's blackened haki and...

"Prominence Acceleration!!"

It radiated like a black sun.
The jet-black darkness was colored by the red lotus' flames.
The black and crimson sunlight, with its brutal violence, took on the shape of an oriental dragon. Then, as if it had a will of its own, it surged and attacked Milim, as if to swallow her up.
Milim had no choice but to react to this.
Because Benimaru's 'Prominence Acceleration', though instantaneous, generated tens of millions of energies.

.........

......

...

Power was calculated from the relationship between output and total amount of energy. No matter how large the total energy was, if the output was low, the power was weak. On the other hand, no matter how large the output was, if the amount of energy was small, the power could not be high.
In the case of Benimaru, the output power was perfect. His total amount of energy was not small, but it was not enough to fight against Milim.
And yet, how did Benimaru unleash such a super-powerful special move?

![break]

<<Master's power has been lent.>>

![break]

*Huh?*

I was not aware of any symptoms, but Ciel-san, just what are you doing all on your own?
No, well, I don't have a problem if it helps everyone, but you should have explained it to me first...

![break]

<<Since it was still in the experimental stage, I planned to report it after it was successful.>>

![break]

Hmm, too much of a perfectionist as always.
It might just be a minor experiment to Ciel-san, but it seemed important to me.
No, that kind of complaint is for later.
For now, I'll ask for an explanation of what happened.
According to Ciel-san...

My Ultimate Skill 'Void God Azathoth' has an inexhaustible source of energy known as 'Nihility Collapse' that is difficult to handle. Ciel-san had been considering how to make the best use of it to our advantage. As a part of such experiments, it approached some of the executives to negotiate with them.
If that's the case, why don't I just do the experiment myself---

![break]

<<Putting Master at risk is not possible.>>

![break]

And so, that was flatly denied.
I think it would be safe in the labyrinth, but Ciel-san seemed to think of this as unacceptable.
As the target in question, I guess I should be thankful to them for being so overprotective of me.
In any case, Ciel-san had devised and built a system to supply the energy of 'Nihility Collapse' to a few people who were connected to me through 'Soul Corridor'.
Indeed, it was Ciel-sensei at its best.

In principle, it seemed to be an application of 'Supply and Demand', but as a secret technique that integrated the Ultimate Skill 'Void God Azathoth' and 'Harvest King Shub-Niggurath', Ciel-sensei was the only one who could accomplish this.
Although this mechanism was still a work in progress, it was the secret to Benimaru's instantaneous surge in power---the 'Nihility Supply'.

.........

......

...

The 'Prominence Acceleration' wrapped itself around Milim as it tried to bite her.
Milim stopped moving as she tried to shake it off.

"Demonwire Bind."

Souei used his threads to capture Milim.

"Hundredfold Prison."

Through Leon's will, a cage of 'Disintegration' was completed.
The Invisible Barrier sparkled like a star, but Milim's Drago Nova did not activate. This bought us enough time.
By the way, Zalario did not seem to have any capturing techniques, so he only applied pressure with haki. It was effective enough, but I secretly felt that it was not enough.

Now then, the ideal situation was in place.
I, too, was ready. In order to make sure that everyone's hard work did not go to waste, we had to make this a success.
I'm counting on you, Ciel-sensei!

![break]

<<Leave it to me.>>

![break]

I don't think it's right to rely on a Skill at these critical moments, but since Ciel-san and I are one and the same, this was the same as me doing my best.
After arming myself that way with the perfect logic, I braced myself and waited for the results.

![break]

<<Reset.>>

![break]

It worked like a charm.
Apparently, because Ciel-san understood the power of 'Justice King Michael', it was thus able to duplicate and negate its influence.
Thus, Feldway's 'Regalia Dominion', which had been influencing Milim, lost its effect completely in that instant.


![soft scene break]


The operation was a success, and all was well.
I would have liked to congratulate everyone for their good work, but Milim was still in a frenzied state.
Milim's order to destroy the Sacred Tree had been lifted, but the problem was still not over from here. If we continued to fight here, the aftermath of the battle alone would cause Sarion to suffer tremendous damage.
We needed to relocate... There was the Republic of Ur-Gracia and other nations around Sarion, and across the sea, there was Leon's country. Since the Western Nations were spread out in the opposite direction, the best route to minimize the damage would be to lead them to the Barren Lands via the sea.

This would affect the territory controlled by Dagruel, but it was too late for that now. However, because I didn't want to cause any damage to the people living there, we had to make sure to evacuate the people in the area.
At times like these, it was up to Souei.

<Souei, I'm going to lead Milim to the Barren Lands now, but I don't want the people of Dagruel to be harmed. Can you do something?>

I told him the gist of what I was planning.
As expected, I received the answer I was hoping for.

<Leave it to me. I've left a 'Clone' for such an eventuality, so you can move immediately.>

As expected of Souei, a true professional.
No faults at all.
Normally, I wouldn't be thinking "I guess it's possible", but with Souei, I was convinced.
Souei's manly capability was proven once again, and even though I usually felt sarcastic about it, today I felt happy.
I was so relieved to know that he could handle this situation, so I left it to him.
But then something terrible happened.

![break]

Time stopped.
*Who the heck did not read the situation and did something so unnecessary!!* I inwardly complained as hard as I could.
Rather, it wouldn't have been a problem if Milim stopped too, but she was moving about as if it was only natural. Moreover, during a Time Stop, the world's defense power was at zero, so Milim running amok had now become an extremely dangerous existence.
She had already been dangerous before, but now things could be over with just a touch.
Fighting her here was a bad idea, so the only place to lead her was the Desert of Death.

It was good that I had attracted Milim's attention before she went on a rampage, but if I continued to guide her away, we wouldn't be able to make it with enough time for the evacuation route I requested of Souei.
There were almost no uninhabited places in the world and destroying the ecosystem alone was a problem in itself.

"This way, Milim!"

I shouted to get Milim's attention and started moving anyway.
This was a very unpleasant turn of events, but aerial combat with Milim in the Suspended World had now begun.
If I had not been able to handle Time Stop, it would have all been over at this point. I was grateful but fighting Milim in this situation was hard.
I could feel my strength being drained away.
On the other hand, Milim's strength looked to be inexhaustible, and in fact, it was increasing rapidly. Even with elementary-school-level mathematics, it was clearly obvious who would run out of stamina first.
We were doomed at this rate.
It would be a problem to just wait until the world collapsed, but I didn't even know who had stopped time in the first place.

Chloe was ruled out.
Guy or Velzard was a possibility, but I didn't think it made sense since they were both among those who could move.
Just who was it that did something so unnecessary...

Feldway?
It was certainly the perfect way to harass a victim, but was this really the right time to use it?
This was not the time to be looking for the culprit, but I needed to find out who did it in order to do something about the situation.
At that time...

<Rimuru, can you hear me?>

Veldora spoke to me through 'Telepathy Net'.
To be precise, the thought data was transmitted via 'Soul Corridor'. In the Suspended World, it was almost impossible to use magicule-based Skills, so it was difficult to transmit even information aside from exceptions like us.
Or rather, it seems that Veldora was not affected by Time Stop either.
It's as expected, or just a matter of course...

<Yes, yes, I can hear you.>

<What are you talking about?! In this situation, Shion and Luminas are in danger!! Adalmann and the others are having a tough time, but there is no one who can stand up to Dagruel's Time Stop.>

<Hm? Was it Dagruel who stopped time?>

<Mm, that's right. That Dagruel is trying to end the battle quickly!>

I see, the culprit was suddenly revealed.
The fact that the culprit was currently fighting Shion's group meant that, as I had feared, the enemy had used 'Spatial Transportation' on their whole army. That's fine, Shion's group must have worked hard enough to make Dagruel take them seriously.
The Suspended World was only useful to cut off the weak; it was extremely useful against those who could not cope with it. I had gotten hit with it myself, so I never thought that Dagruel could use it.

Now then, what to do?
There were two problems here.
The first was that Shion and Luminas would be wiped out unless someone came to their rescue.
The second problem was the means of transportation.

During Time Stop, 'Spatial Transportation' was basically impossible because it required flying information particles to understand the surrounding information. Although it was possible to move them within a visible range, it was meaningless because it would be faster to move normally.
This was because, regardless of the distance, the coordinates of the destination had to be read by interfering with the information particles. If the information particles had to be moved back and forth, it would be faster for me to just move.
In this case, even if I went to the rescue right now, Dagruel would have finished his complete control of the area before I could reach Lubelius.

The result would be the same whether I went there or asked Veldora to do so.
And since I was currently dealing with Milim, Veldora was the only one I could ask...

<Veldora, even if you can't reach them in time, will you go to their rescue right now?>

<I've been waiting for you to say that!>

In truth, I had hoped that Veldora would be in charge of the final defense of the labyrinth. However, now was not the time to say such things.
Right now we had to find a means of transportation, I had to keep my spirits up.

<Rimuru-sama, Ultima and her thoughts are connected. We can send the coordinates to Veldora-sama.>

*Oh?!*

It was Diablo who interrupted the conversation at that point.

![break]

<<'Spatial Transportation' is possible even in a Suspended World as long as the coordinate information is known even at a long distance. Since Ultima is on site, I shared her senses and perceptions to acquire information.>>

![break]

I-is that so?
So, in other words, it's possible because they're connected to me through the Soul Corridor?

![break]

<<That's correct.>>

![break]

It declared that to me proudly, but long-distance transfer during a Time Stop really was a foul trick.
It was normally impossible.
To have those able to recognize the Suspended World even be connected to each other with a 'Soul Corridor' was so exceptional that I was left speechless.
In that case, anything was possible.
But I would not hold back.

<Ultima, I'm counting on you!>

<Yes! Rimuru-sama, leave it to me!! Veldora-sama, is this all right?>

<Mm, good work! Kuahahaha, my turn has come at last!!>

Veldora's laughter was very encouraging.
Moreover, the fact that Diablo and Ultima were now able to recognize the Suspended World was also very reassuring in this situation.
And then, I sensed that Veldora had teleported.

![break]

The world began to move once again.

![break]

As I believed he would, it seemed that Veldora did a good job.
I felt relieved and resumed my mission.
I flew toward the Barren Lands while trying to distract the out-of-control Milim.


![hard scene break]


Jahil was feeling resentful and helpless as he dealt with Kagali and the others.
He had expected them to be inferior small-fry, but he had been unable to inflict any decisive damage on them. He couldn't help but feel angry.
Even so, his thoughts were calm.
He was fully aware of what was happening around him.

*No way, I don't believe it... I never expected that the Dragon Princess would have such a ridiculous amount of power...no, more than that---*

Zalario's betrayal was the problem.
He didn't know how it happened, but even Zalario was cooperating in detaining Milim.
This was a serious problem.
He didn't care about his allegiance to Feldway or anything like that.

For Jahil, the problem was the lack of reliable allies in this region.
If it was just Kagali and the others, he could defeat them as they were. However, if even Zalario became Jahil's enemy, it would be difficult even for him to escape.

<Feldway, this is a whole other situation!!>

Jahil vented his anger on Feldway in a furious 'Telepathy Net'.
After a brief silence, Feldway responded in a muffled voice.

<Zalario betrayed us...?>

<This is no time to be dumbfounded! At this rate, even I will be in danger. I'm withdrawing, is that all right with you?>

Jahil was arguing on this, but he was already moving to retreat.
It was humiliating for Jahil to face such lowly opponents, but his cautiousness was the reason why he had been able to survive until now.
Otherwise, he would have been obliterated by Milim's attack long ago.

Jahil took hold of the Origin Blood and released a power he hadn't used before.
The power of the Origin Blood was strong. Jahil was forcing it to accept him as the master, but it was still dangerous to use it too often because of its repulsive power.
However, it was also true that it was an ultimate weapon that could be relied upon when the time came. When its power and Jahil's ability were combined, it became the ferocious 'Evil Blood Wave' that could vaporize even the largest of nations.

In principle, this was the same as the so-called vaporization bomb.
By burning magicules scattered over a wide area all at once, an explosive firestorm was generated.
Jahil had not been fighting at random.
While he was fighting off Teare and Silvia, he had also been secretly dispersing magicules. And now they had spread enough to fill the battlefield, transforming it into a deadly hellfire at any time at Jahil's will.

*These guys will withstand my 'Evil Blood Wave', though.*

Because it was an extensive anti-army technique, it lacked decisive power against powerful opponents. However, it was impossible for greater majins to survive.
The widely scattered magicules covered Sarion's Magus. Zalario's subordinates would also be engulfed and burned to the ground, but that was not of Jahil's concern. It was a perfect distraction to save his own life, so he did so without hesitation.

"All you worthless things should understand just how great I am!" Jahil shouted, and the 'Evil Blood Wave' exploded into flames.

The Sacred Tree was engulfed in fire, its bark combusting in the extreme heat.
The Magus, who had been deployed vertically and horizontally to protect the Sacred Tree, were also engulfed by the flames in that instant.
Silvia and Teare, who were standing in front of Jahil, and Kagali, who was a little behind him, were also caught up in the flames, unable to react.

"Gera-hahaha! Go to hell, you maggots! You'll regret what you did to me in the afterlife."

Jahil guffawed heartily and snuck away, hiding in the flames.

.........

......

...

The raging flames were so intense that even the atmosphere was burning up.
However, the moment Jahil was out of sight:

"Good grief, thank goodness that bastard is so inattentive."

At the same time Benimaru said that, all the flames were extinguished.
The catastrophic damage from the fire turned out to be minor. Silvia, Teare, and Kagali did not suffer a single burn. Even the Magus, who were in the most dangerous situation, were all unharmed.
Some of the magitech knights who were exposed to the instantaneous heat were unable to move, but their bodies were protected, and they did not suffer serious injuries.
Although the Sacred Tree was supposed to have burst into flames, each and every branch of the tree was still fresh, although the surface was a bit scorched. This was proof that the tree was not as damaged as it looked. It would be restored to its original state in a few days.

"Seriously, it was really difficult to manipulate the air without Jahil noticing, you know?"

"As expected of Your Majesty Elmesia. As I had hoped, you took the appropriate measures."

Benimaru smiled briskly as if to appease the complaining Elmesia.
As one could see from this exchange, the reason why the 'Evil Blood Wave' did not cause as much damage was because Benimaru had been working behind the scenes.
Benimaru's work had been so active that he could be considered a truly outstanding help, competent in all matters of the project.
He had assisted Kagali and the others against Jahil while leading the operation to stop Milim. In addition, he had noticed Jahil's plan and negotiated with Elmesia to stop it before it could cause any damage.

The magicules spread by Jahil's power was a special flammable substance known as Blood Mist. This was one of the powers of the Origin Blood, which vampires sometimes used in their own techniques.
It had a smell that was slightly different from naturally occurring magicules. Benimaru detected it through precise 'Magic Power Manipulation' and realized that Jahil had been up to something.

As a matter of fact, there was one other person besides Benimaru who had noticed this anomaly---
Silvia.
She had immediately sensed the danger, but she had no idea what to do about it. They could escape from the danger by evacuating as much as possible, but there would still be people who would suffer damage. Moreover, if they made a move, Jahil might speed up his actions.
She had been worried about what to do and asked Benimaru for advice, as the damage was expected to be more widespread.

Benimaru, who had been aware of this, was able to accurately grasp the situation.
That alone was a great achievement, but it did not mean that he came up with the solution.
The answer came from the heavens.

![break]

<<Use Elmesia's Ultimate Skill 'Heavenly Wind King Vayu' to collect only the Blood Mist, and the Ultimate Skill 'Heat King Amaterasu' to burn only the magic blood.>>

![break]

Upon hearing this, Benimaru acted without hesitation.
There were some things in this world that were best not pursued too deeply.
Even when Rimuru had connected the energy circuit of 'Nihility Collapse', he had heard that "voice". However, Benimaru pretended not to notice anything and accepted everything as it was.

*Everything is according to the will of Rimuru-sama. If this heavenly voice is working in Rimuru-sama's favor, I shall obey it.*

Benimaru had taken it upon himself to be active both in front and behind the scenes. With the cooperation of Elmesia and others, he overcame the difficulty this time, too.

![break]

Thus, thanks to the efforts of Benimaru, Silvia, and Elmesia, Jahil's plan was foiled.
Although Jahil himself had been allowed to escape, Benimaru decided that he should not take any chances with his limited resources, so this was the best possible outcome.
Once everything was settled, Benimaru collapsed. He had seen that Jahil escaped and relaxed. Perhaps anticipating this, Souei quickly supported him.

"It's no wonder, he has done such a great job!"

Elmesia's eyes were full of respect as she looked at the unconscious Benimaru, and her words were kind. From Elmesia's point of view, Benimaru was a champion who saved Sarion from a crisis. Recognizing how hard Benimaru had worked, it was only natural for Elmesia to react in this way.

However, Benimaru aside, Elmesia's work still remained to be done. The most important job was to deal with Zalario and his army, which was still alive and well.
Elmesia was concerned. Jahil's escape had kept the battlefield in a lull. Both sides were waiting to see how the other side would react, and Elmesia was wondering whether or not the battle should be resumed.

Because Benimaru had moved to neutralize Jahil's attack, Zalario's forces had not suffered any damage.
In other words, Sarion's forces were at a slight disadvantage, let alone in balance.
The rest of the army was not that much of a threat, but the two enemy leaders were really troublesome, and the problems were endless.
In the first place, it was uncertain whether the enemy would agree to a truce or not.
While simulating various possibilities, Elmesia thought at lightning speed---

But before those simulation results could even finish, her worries were soon cleared.


![hard scene break]


Dhalis and Nice were in charge of Zalario's army.
They and their confidants were those who had lost the battle for an undead elf incarnation, and their egos had been extinguished. The Throne-angel class was weak-willed.
Even though they had been fighting for so long... No, it was the other way around. It was precisely because of the repetition of the same work for such a long and unchanging time that their souls were worn out and their egos faded away.
One of the reasons for this could be that Zalario was a warrior.

In contrast, there was the army of Obera. The camaraderie was strong in her army, and everyone loved her. There were many who had been killed in battle, and Oma had been the only deputy left, but they were all valiant warriors who were willing to risk their lives for Obera.

Zalario's army, on the other hand, was a mechanical force, organized and disciplined. There was no need for an ego; they were all mere cogs in a machine, doing only what they were ordered to do.
For this reason, Zalario had few true comrades, and now there were only two---Dhalis and Nice.
They approached Zalario and asked him a question.

"For some reason, that man Benimaru seems to have protected us as well. As a result, the battle has been suspended, but would you like to resume it?"

"Zalario-sama, are you sure? Didn't you betray Feldway-sama?"

Dhalis made a matter-of-fact confirmation in a clerical manner. Nice kept Zalario in mind and tacitly asked him about the future plans. Zalario thought that these were interesting questions because of the differences in their direction.

*Surprisingly, a sense of individuality has been born.*

It hadn't occurred to him until now, but Zalario's lieutenants also had their own opinions which he had not noticed before. Zalario was happy to know that.

"Huh, you guys are so serious."

" "...?!" "

Dhalis and Nice were startled when Zalario smiled. They were shocked to the point of earth-shattering surprise. It was only natural as Zalario's smile had never once existed in their memories.

"Z-Zalario-sama?"

"By any chance, is this some kind of a plan?! Or are you testing us?"

Zalario controlled his flustered deputies with his hand and spun his words.

"Calm down. I have decided that further fighting is pointless."

"What?!"

It was a formal declaration of the end of the battle that came from Zalario's mouth.
Dhalis was surprised but had no objections. He complied obediently and passed the order on to the entire army.

"And Nice, I did not betray Feldway. On the contrary, he took away my free will and betrayed the trust I placed in him as a friend!" Zalario announced with simmering anger.

It was a declaration of farewell.

"Then, from now on, with Feldway-sama..."

Zalario nodded his head in agreement to Nice's fearful question.

"That's right. I have decided to part ways with Feldway."

This statement made not only Nice but also Dhalis gasp.

"Fortunately," Zalario continued, "you guys did not have an Ultimate Skill. You were not enchanted with an Ultimate Skill and are free to protect your ego. You may continue to follow me, or you may join Feldway. I will give you a moment to choose whatever you like."

Dhalis and Nice were confused by the sudden proposal.

"Y-you don't need us anymore?"

"P-perhaps, did I make some kind of mistake?"

They were upset in this way, but Zalario calmed them down.

"No, that's not it. I, too, have been freed from the domination, and I have realized the importance of freedom. That is why you guys should see the beauty of this world as well."

With that said, the two of them looked around once more.
The sky was clear and cloudless, as if the previous turmoil had been a beautiful lie.
The Sacred Tree, having been protected from the threat of Milim, stood majestically, although its charred bark was still noticeable. Its branches spread wide as if supporting the sky, and its huge lush green leaves were bushy.
A pleasant breeze blew over Zalario and the others gathering on the leaves. It was a breath of fresh air that blew away old thoughts.

"We are now in a truce with the insectars, who have been our enemies for the longest time. I was going to follow Feldway as a favor to my friend, but I cannot tolerate his way of doing things. I am going to find a new way of life," Zalario told them.

He made it clear, even if somewhat snidely, that he would no longer obey Feldway. Moreover, although Zalario was a warrior, he had no taste for finding new enemies. He had been fighting all this time only because he had to, not because fighting itself was his purpose in life.
He had been forced to fight his whole life, but perhaps it was time to turn his attention to something else, he contemplated.
And his lieutenants agreed with him.

"To tell you the truth, I have been thinking about a great many things since inhabiting an undead elf. It seems that my body is inhabited by the will of someone else, and if it's allowed, I would like to find a hobby other than fighting," Dhalis confided hesitantly.

"That's fine," Zalario nodded.

"I don't have any particular opinions about it. I will continue to follow Zalario-sama."

Nice's will was firm. Being useful to Zalario was Nice's only consistent wish.

"I'll allow it."

Zalario accepted the offer.
He was determined to live freely, but not irresponsibly. He would not abandon those who loved and followed him.

"In that case, so will I."

"Are you sure? I won't stop looking for hobbies."

"Fufufu, finding a hobby would be fun, but we're not in a hurry. Let's wait until everyone has settled down before we start having fun."

*That's a good idea,* Zalario thought.
Their lives were still going on. It would not be a bad idea to slow down and take time to consider what to do.
However, for that, it was necessary to lead the world to peace.

"Then it seems we have found our next goal."

The world was so beautiful. And yet, Feldway did not even bother to look at it. Right now, Feldway was the one who was disturbing this world.

*As a friend, I cannot overlook this outrage,* Zalario thought.

"Listen up! The enemy is Feldway!! Let us break through his delusional ambitions and stabilize the world!!"

" " "Understood!!" " "

Zalario's army was as united as cogs in a gear train.
This time, too, the decision was made unanimously.

![break]

Upon Zalario's order, all the soldiers disarmed at once.

"I see no point in further combat action, so what about you?"
Zalario, who went to Elmesia alone, said.

"I agree," answered Elmesia. "It didn't seem like you enjoyed the fight either, so let's call it even."

Elmesia's statement was equivalent to a declaration that she would not hold them accountable for the war.
As a ruler, she should have taken compensation from the aggressor, but Elmesia made this proposal to forcefully bring the battle to an end.

The royal families also supported this proposal. Or rather, they had no choice but to support it. In effect, the continuation of further fighting was a matter of national survival. Although the magitech knights could be repaired, the Magus had been badly damaged. If the battle had continued, there would be many casualties. The loss of life could not be compensated for with money, and the nation's strength would have been reduced. The upheaval by Feldway was expected to continue in the future, and military power could not be wasted at this point.

Fortunately, no leader was foolish enough not to understand this. The emperor's decision was not disputed, and everyone agreed with it. The summit conference between Elmesia and Zalario resulted in a successful agreement to the battle's conclusion.
Following this, a declaration of collaboration was issued.
Thus, for the time being, Zalario's army would be stationed in Sarion to prepare for the unprecedented crisis that was to come.


![hard scene break]


Looking down from above, Feldway discerned the entire battlefield.

"Zalario betrayed me..."

It was a shock to Feldway. The departure of Zalario, one of his few confidants and old friends, was an event that he had never imagined.
That's when he snapped.
He had lost Michael and then he was betrayed by Zalario.
It was only after the loss that he understood how important they had been to him.

*Are you abandoning me too? If that's the case, I will not hesitate anymore. I will risk my life to prove the existence of god!!*

Feldway's heart became further distorted and broken.
Unbeknownst to anyone, beyond repair.

"What are you going to do, Feldway?" Vega asked.

This one was really easy-going. He lived freely for his own purposes and pleasures, without any sense of responsibility.
Looking at Vega, Feldway smiled faintly.

"Hm, everything is going as planned."

"But hey, wasn't Milim supposed to knock down the giant tree?"

"It could have gone either way. We can always destroy it later."

Although Zalario's betrayal had not been planned, it was true that Feldway's plan was still intact. Thus, Feldway's confidence was not shaken.
The hour of destiny was near.
Any doubts that had lingered in his heart were erased by the feelings of Zalario's betrayal.
It was as if Feldway was now driven by only a single purpose.
That is why he would not stop now.

"Vega, you and Dino will head out to conquer the labyrinth."

"Oh? I'm finally getting my turn!" Vega laughed happily.

Mai, who has been standing by, also got up at Feldway's gaze. Vega and the others could not leave the Heavenly Star Palace because they had not been given the key. Mai had been given a duplicate of the key, so she was able to send Vega and the others on their way with 'Instantaneous Movement'.

Incidentally, the key from the other world to the Heavenly Star Palace was also in Feldway's possession. But for the key to Heaven's Tower, which connected the palace to the earth---only Velzard possessed the true lock.

However, the Cardinal World was already registered in the key possessed by Feldway and the others, so there was no longer any inconvenience for them to move around. Mai, for example, had a duplicated key as her Ultimate Enchantment, so she could move to the Heavenly Star Palace from anywhere.
This key was also given to Dino and his comrades, but they were not very happy about it.

"Eh, me too?"

Dino reacted in disgust but was ignored.
Now that Veldora, the biggest fighting force in the labyrinth, had left, this was the perfect time to take advantage of it. No matter what Dino said, the decision would not be reversed.

"Expect good news."

Vega left with those words.
Mai led the way, followed by a drooping Dino, Pico and Gracia taking their leave along with him.

![break]

Thus, silence fell over the Heavenly Star Palace.
Feldway, who was left alone, laughed with a genuinely pleasant smile.
It was a roar of laughter tinged with some kind of madness.


![full page image](image13.jpg){Feldway laughing like a maniac: nice Joker impression.}


Feldway, looking down at the ground, began to make his own final move.
