# Afterword

Finally, I have finished writing volume 20.

I was told that the deadline would not be extended, but the truth is that it was really difficult because there were a lot of problems.
To be more specific, I was in a slump.
I was mentally not motivated to write at all...or rather, I was in a situation where I could come up with a scene but couldn't concentrate on writing it down.

In addition to writing the main part of the book, I had a lot of work to do, so my energy was quite low. But even so, this was the first time that I had ever felt so much of a lack of motivation to write.
I had no choice but to change my writing environment as a last resort. I was worried about how it would turn out, but I went to Tokyo to enjoy hotel life. I stayed in a hotel and tried my best to live a life of writing.

Of course, at my own expense.
Well, I was told that the publisher would publish my book, but I felt that it would only increase the pressure to write more and more, which I didn't like. I was worried about getting writer's block, so I refused the offer, saying that I didn't want to be trapped anymore and that I would pay for it by myself.
As a result, I was able to complete my quotas every day, as if my three months of writers' block had been a lie.

I guess the environment is very important after all. It is more important than anything else to have a normal life and to keep your writing rhythm. I know it is difficult to do so, but still...

I would like to thank the hotel staff for their kindness. I was so comfortable that I didn't want to go back home.
I-san, who oversaw the hotel, said to me with a straight face, "Don't you have to go back?" His delivery was so stone-cold that it didn't sound like a joke to me...
I-san is probably serious, so I will try my best to prevent that from happening (bitter smile).

During my stay in Tokyo, I had a chance to meet with some writers and some of them said that they were in the same situation as me. It seems that many of them are mentally drained because they cannot go out due to the coronavirus.
Many of you may have probably increased your work at home due to the coronavirus, and people like me, who are not good at self-control, might be experiencing the same kind of suffering to a greater or lesser extent.
In such a case, it is important to have a change of pace!

Please take a break and try not to overdo it.

I hope that my work That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime will be of some help to you and give you peace of mind. I will continue to do my best to complete the story.

See you again in the next volume!
