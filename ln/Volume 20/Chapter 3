# Chapter 3: Quake of|the Titans

At the border between the Barren Lands and the Western Nations, there was a long structure called the Long Wall.
It was said to have been built by the work of the god Luminas in order to protect civilization from the hot sands known as the Desert of Death.
This Long Wall was considered sacred because it was protected by a special barrier. That is, the magicule repellent barrier.
As the name suggested, its purpose was to prevent the intrusion of monsters.

It was common knowledge for those who lived in the frontier that this barrier was a zone of protection for human existence. The barrier was activated to protect the Long Wall, preventing the invasion of monsters coming from the Desert of Death.
The principle was simple: by inhibiting the accumulation of magicules, its purpose was to prevent giant monsters from appearing. At the same time, it had the property of repelling magicules, so that more powerful monsters would not be attracted to it.

Of course, this was not a universal solution, and monsters sometimes invaded through the frayed edges of the barriers. However, since there were desert people who hunted monsters for a living, this had never been a major problem.
This Long Wall was considered to be the front line of the battle against monsters and was included in the patrol routes of the Holy Knight Order.
Through these regular patrols, the cracks in the barriers have been found and repaired. That work also included defeating invading monsters, thus protecting the lives of the people on the frontier.

These facts have been accumulated, and the belief in the god Luminas was thus enhanced.
At the same time, the myth of the safety of the Long Wall was firmly unshakable.
However, today...

After 2,000 years, the Long Wall would be revealed in its true form.

![break]

At the top of the Long Wall, there was a skeleton wearing sacred vestments.
It was Adalmann.
A few moments ago, a distortion of space had been detected. Immediately after that, a large-scale teleportation revealed an army of giants.

"Oh, just as my god predicted, the enemy has teleported."

Far from being flustered, Adalmann was murmuring happily.
He was more excited than threatened by the fact that Rimuru's prediction had come true.
Still, he did not forget his duty in his excitement. He finished the 'Telepathy Net' to his home country and then switched his attention to the battle in earnest.

On the other hand, the giants who had transferred to the new location were convinced that their surprise attack had succeeded. They believed that the enemy would be in a panic since they had all moved several days' worth of travel with Mai's ability.
Dagruel's group had deliberately shown their march to catch Luminas off guard. The enemy must have seen this and taken countermeasures, predicting that they would not be fully prepared to intercept them.
But in fact, that was not the case.

As of yesterday, it was not something to be panicked about, and a defensive posture had been constructed to be able to respond to the situation without sleep or rest.
The majesty of the Chained Titan Army was still clear even though they were far away.
More than their numbers, their quality was overwhelming.
Each of them was a huge mass of muscles.

Various kinds of giants such as giant ogres, cyclops, and multi-armed giants (hecatoncheires^[In Greek mythology, hecatoncheires (or 'hundred-handers') were three enormous giants with fifty heads and one hundred arms each.]) were approaching them in packs.
Adalmann laughed at the sight of Dagruel's army as they emerged.

"Well, what a spectacular sight. This might be a bit of a challenge for my little skeletons."

"A bit, huh?"

Adalmann was answered by a beautiful purple-haired woman standing next to him. It was Shion, looking great in her suit.

"To tell you the truth, it will be a little...it will be difficult, but we'll make it work."

Adalmann hated to lose, so he never complained before battle. It was even or so because his army was immortal and could easily be revived.

"Hoh...what's your plan?"

Shion questioned the reason for Adalmann's confident attitude.

"Hm, I can't say that it's much of a plan, but Albert's command is quite good. Moreover, please take a closer look. Behold the line-up of my army!"

Adalmann said as such and then pointed to his subordinates---the Immortal Legion was all lined up in order.

"How is it? The equipment bestowed by my god has even reached the Bone Soldiers!!"

Shion understood after being told. In short, this guy just wanted to show off.

.........

......

...

Adalmann was leading the immortal monsters he had summoned himself.
It was a spectacular sight to see such immortal monsters perfectly lined up inside the Long Wall.
The main force was led by two thousand death knights.

The death knights, led by the death lord, were the immortal knights who rode on death horses. They were equipped with full-body magisteel chainmail armor, magimail, that gave off a faint glow. Needless to say, it was the best quality armor of the dwarf factory made in Tempest.

Although not produced by Garm himself, it was a high-class product made by his disciples, who lavishly used high-purity magisteel. The performance was guaranteed, and the product blended well with the mana of the death knights.

Since their defensive and offensive capabilities had been dramatically improved, they were more dangerous than their original A-minus rank. Now, they were as close to A rank as possible and had become strong enough to live up to their name as a main force.

And that's not all.
In addition to the main force, there were other hidden gems.
Deployed on the Long Wall were lower-ranking monsters that lacked direct offensive power.
The total number of them was 50,000.

- 10,000 Zombie Soldiers.

- 20,000 Bone Soldiers.

- 10,000 Bone Archers.

- 10,000 Bone Knights.

Looking only at the numbers, it was an overwhelming fighting force.
Of course, they were weak individuals with an average strength of about D rank, so they would be of little use even if they were operated as they were. However, what was noteworthy here was the equipment of the monsters.
Adalmann was proud of it; the latest weapons, which were manufactured at full capacity in the monster nation factories, were being used generously in battle.
The armor was standardized, so although the colors differed according to ranks, the uniforms of Tempest were identical in performance. The uniforms had a reasonable level of protection, and were even provided with fire-resistance, cold-resistance, and so on.

![break]

The most notable feature of the Bone Archers were the portable recoilless missile launchers on their backs. The missile projectiles, which were launched at five times the speed of sound, contained not only explosives, but also compressed magicules.
The Bone Archers were carried by Bone Soldiers, who were trained to support each Bone Archer with two Bone Soldiers. Thus, as many as 10,000 mobile artillery batteries were born.
However, the number of bullets was somewhat middling. The total number of rounds was 50,000, including one round loaded from the beginning and two rounds carried by each soldier.

Next, the Zombie Soldiers were all carrying automatic rifles. Although those were gunpowder weapons with no magicules, their destructive power was not to be underestimated. They would not be effective against enemies with physical resistance, but they were expected to have good results against lower-ranked giants.
Although the manufacturing method had been researched and established, the production of these firearms had been prohibited upon Rimuru's decision. However, only this time, the experimental operation had been permitted under the condition that the serial number and the tracking magic were stamped on them.
Or rather, the documents had come to Rimuru in the middle of a busy day, and he had stamped his seal without checking it carefully, so only Ciel was aware. Rimuru himself was unaware of such a situation, but it was probably lucky that Adalmann did not know about it.
And this was not the only secret weapon.

Finally, there was the equipment of the Bone Knights.
Amazingly enough, they were all equipped with Imperial magic sabers. They even had spell guns hanging from their waists.
Equipped with armaments salvaged from the imperial soldiers, the sabers had greatly increased their offensive power while ignoring their defensive power.
It was extreme, but Adalmann decided that if he could incorporate suicide attack tactics into his immortal soldiers who did not fear death, then actual ability would be irrelevant.
This was the essence of the Immortal Legion.

An army of immortals, who did not require food or sleep, was assigned as the first force to intercept.
To make things even more troubling, these immortals all had their abilities increased under Adalmann's control. In addition, the 'Holy-Demonic Reversal' ability of the Ultimate Gift 'Necronomicon' changed their attributes, so they were no longer affected by the magicule repellent barrier that stretched along the Long Wall, and they could work in the daytime without any problems.

Unlike in the labyrinth, the dead could not be resurrected once destroyed...but because holy magic would not work, it was advantageous that they would not be purified by means such as 'Purification of the Dead: Turn Undead'.
Only those who had fought against them could understand just how terrifying the undead were now that they had become holy beings. Since they could not be killed by conventional attacks, the only way to stop them was to destroy them.

Now that very Immortal Legion had been deployed to intercept the enemy by making good use of the Long Wall.
The Long Wall was arranged in such a way that one could see everything in a panoramic view from the top, which was more than five meters high, making it easy for snipers to shoot at the enemy.
In fact, the original function of the Long Wall that Luminas had built was precisely to serve as a defensive facility to thwart Dagruel's territorial ambitions. The appearance of such weapons was unforeseen, and the vampires were initially supposed to intercept them with their magic, but since they were able to secure the advantage in this way, the details were not important.

.........

......

...

Shion's eyes narrowed at the sight of Adalmann's prided subordinates.
Shion had honestly thought that it would be meaningless to have as many skeletons as possible.
However, she changed her mind the moment she saw the equipment.
No, what she was more concerned about was:

"Hey, Adalmann...I want to ask, how did you get all of that equipment?"

The equipment for subordinates was provided by their superiors. That was the common understanding among the corps commanders and executives.
Of course, if you applied for and received permission, your equipment would be distributed to you. However, that was a waiting list, and no one, not even the leaders, was allowed to skip out on that process.
In the workshop of Tempest, the Second Corps led by Geld was given priority. Since this was directly related to national defense, no one had complained about it.
Although all of them had been equipped recently, the large number of equipment made it difficult to do maintenance. Since they were made of magical steel, most of them could self-repair, but it was still true that most of the equipment reservations were filled by the Second Corps.

The next spot was for commercial use for adventurers.
Since the purpose of this business was a national policy to earn foreign currency, Shion could not interfere.
Therefore, waiting for free equipment took too much time.
In the midst of all this, there were many roughnecks enrolled in the Yomigaeri who spent every day in training.
That in itself was commendable, but it was not productive.
Some people might think that this was not a problem as they were professional soldiers, but since they often broke their equipment or tore their uniforms, they often used the repair workshop with a consistent frequency.
Of course, free of charge.

Therefore, Shion had received many complaints.
Under such circumstances, it was impossible to apply for new equipment, and the official equipment of the Yomigaeri was still in its initial state.
Even then, they were given only to the executives and early members, and not to the newcomers who had recently joined the group.
For those newcomers, apprentice craftsmen had given them the equipment they had made for practice, and they had equipped them diligently...but the appearance was not consistent, and bandanas and armbands had to be used to emphasize the purple color to somehow keep up appearances.
Shion, who had no choice but to ask Rimuru for new equipment again, was filled with a sense of wonder as to how Adalmann, a newcomer to the group, was getting new equipment.
Adalmann answered this question with a smile.

"Well, it's a simple story. I have been stealing cheap equipment worn by adventurers, crushing them, and using the money I get from them to buy iron ore directly. I also have contacts with merchants, so I make use of them as well."

"No, wait. Do challengers even come to the floor that you're guarding?"

Shion was right to be skeptical.
Adalmann's guardianship zone was from floors 61 to 70, meaning that something was being done behind the scenes.

"Hahaha! As for that, I had my men sent on missions to the location. It's also good for training, so it kills two birds with one stone."

Adalmann had been dispatching his subordinate monsters to the upper floors to make a lot of money. In the spirit of the "it's all good as long as you don't get caught" mentality, a rather absurd practice had gone unchecked.

"Yes, yes, I was very pleased to see that so many of the imperial soldiers had good equipment. But even so, the most rewarding thing was the defeat of the iron golem."

Shion was convinced by Adalmann's cheerful voice.
Not only was he playing with adventurers in the labyrinth, but he had also been diligently collecting materials.
The terrain of the 51st to 60th floors was rocky and sometimes golem monsters appeared. Among them, iron golems were rich in high-quality iron. If such monsters were defeated and stored in the labyrinth, high-quality magical steel would be produced before long.
Defeating iron golems was not only a good way to train for combat, but also to collect materials. It killed two birds with one stone, and Shion couldn't help but groan when she caught a glimpse of Adalmann's abundant financial resources. Or rather...

*Huh? Could it be that this guy is making more money than me?!* Shion suddenly realized.

There was a possibility that the other Guardians were also participating in other financial schemes.
On the flip side, was Shion herself. Originally, she had no attachment to money. In her home village of ogres, the blood and knowledge of otherworlders was inherited. Therefore, she understood the concept of economics itself, but...

In the first place, Shion was indifferent to things like money. It was only recently that she began paying attention to such things.

*Adalmann is making more money than me,* it was a bit absurd to be thinking that when Shion herself did not even have a wallet.

Recently, the number of Shion's subordinates had been increasing, and she was just starting to realize that this situation was unsatisfactory.
There was a limit to the deception. The executives of Yomigaeri seemed to be having a harder time than Shion, and she could not remain indifferent to the money-raising schemes.

Incidentally, Benimaru and Souei were also making a surprisingly large amount of money, and they had been updating all of their equipment with those abundant funds. The benefits for their members were also generous, making it a popular place to work.

Surprisingly, Gabil was also reasonably wealthy.
He and Vesta jointly registered patents on their research discoveries, and he earned a regular income. Gabil's subordinates were also paid, so none of them had to worry about the cost of equipment.
That's why it was Shion who had the least money.
Ultima, who had been ordered by Rimuru to provide support, approached the stunned Shion.

"Now, now, Shion-san... You don't have to worry about money, just take it from the enemy!"

She made a truly absurd and devilish proposal.
As the Chief Prosecutor of the Public Prosecution Office, which was in charge of investigating the great evils of their country, this statement was nothing but problematic.
Shion, however, felt as if her eyes had been opened upon hearing this.

"I see, you have a point!"

"Right? I'm so smart!"

And so on and so forth, the two of them were having a good time.
Adalmann, who was listening to them, thought to himself, *I should have known, it was wrong to bring this up on the battlefield.*

It was true that Adalmann himself had robbed adventurers of their equipment in the labyrinth. However, he did so only after ensuring their safety.
And, despite his appearance, Adalmann still had some common sense left over from his former life as a human.
When arranging for the equipment, he had given various kinds of allowances to the craftsmen to receive preferential treatment. Even if they made a mistake, he would never say, "Do it for free!" like Shion would.
That's why he was able to prepare something reasonable promptly...

*This is not good. I'd better keep quiet to Shion-dono.*

Adalmann was very wise to think like that.
The mouth is a source of disaster^[A Japanese proverb (kuchi wa wazawai no moto) that basically means if you can't say anything good, just don't say it at all. Words can lead to disaster and the more you open your mouth, the more likely you are to put your foot in it.]. Master Gadra, Adalmann's good friend who had come to help, nodded his head in agreement.
No, it was indeed true that even Adalmann felt that there were some problems with the fact that his newcomers were better equipped than Shion's veteran guards.
Common sense demanded that the strong should be given preferential treatment over the small fry.
It would be problematic if he got criticized for this, so he shouldn't draw Shion's attention any further.
So, Adalmann decided to quickly divert the conversation.

"Well then, Shion-dono, as planned, we shall take the lead."

Shion-dono turned to the enemy and nodded in agreement.

"All right! I forgive you, so go ahead and be as violent as you like!"

Adalmann patted his chest in relief upon hearing that permission had been granted.

![break]

And then, the battle began.
Dagruel's army, which was supposed to reap all the benefits of the battle and advance toward the holy city, was suddenly blocked.


![hard scene break]


"Hmmm, how cocky..."

Dagruel watched as his vanguard was blown to pieces by a missile and muttered in frustration.
It was an unexpected situation.
He had intended to strike the enemy when their guard was let down, but his plan had been foiled.

"What are you going to do, elder brother?" his dependable younger brother, Glassord, asked.

It was only then that Dagruel realized that his voice had escaped from his mouth.

"Fufufu, it's been a long time since we've been in a real battle. Let's let them play for a while so that they can regain their senses."

It was frustrating that the first move had failed, but that was not a big problem.
The enemy's resistance was fiercer than expected, but even that was a trivial matter for Dagruel.
The Chained Titan Army numbered 30,000.
Among them were, of course, inexperienced and weak soldiers.
Even if they were sifted out, it would be enough if only the best remained. Rather, the survival rate of the soldiers would be higher if they dropped out before the battle intensified.

"Understood. The new recruits and those without 'Ultraspeed Regeneration' will be sent back here."

Glassord also understood Dagruel's thoughts, nodded his head lightly, and gave the instructions. He was very familiar with the situation and did not seem to be intimidated by the prospect of a major war.
When the generals were calm, the subordinates would regain their composure.
Since there was no disturbance in the chain of command, the situation was quickly reorganized.

After that, the giants began to throw projectiles using their monstrous strength. The attack was not prepared from the beginning but was simply an attack of crushing giant rocks to a reasonable size and throwing them as they pleased.
Even so, it was a very destructive attack.
In some cases, they were even equivalent to the missile launchers of the Bone Archers, which was telling of just how unreasonably powerful the Titans were in battle.

The rocks thrown in this way rained down on the Long Wall. The struck areas were severely damaged, and the monsters there were reduced to dust without any way to withstand the damage.
However, the Long Wall itself was still standing.
It was no wonder, then, that what emerged from the peeled-off outer wall was the faint glow of magical steel.

"That Luminas, she's prepared something nasty."

"It's difficult to transfer to the inside of the Long Wall because of the barrier. Unless we break it, the battle will remain deadlocked."

Glassord analyzed the situation in an uninterested manner.
Dagruel sniffed and observed the situation calmly.
His first strategy had been a failure, but that was a natural result if one really thought about it. After all, the cunning Demon Lord Rimuru was waiting on the enemy side.

He had thought that Michael would be crushing Rimuru, but to his surprise, he heard that Rimuru had destroyed Michael.
He should no longer be underestimated as a new demon lord. Although he had been recognized as a demon lord, he had now become a demon lord who should be recognized as equal to or even stronger than himself.

Rimuru's specialty was his tactics in spotting the enemy's strategy and then taking advantage of it. Through their past relations, Dagruel fully understood that Rimuru did not like to see his allies suffer any casualties.
As was shown in Rimuru's strategy, immortal monsters were the first to be deployed. If they ignored the anomaly that they could move even in the daytime, they were essentially just weak monsters.
However, their offensive power could not be ignored.
He had never seen such a weapon before, but as one could see, it was so powerful that a low-ranked warrior stood no chance.

There were some warriors who launched specialized attacks because of that, but they were knocked down by the attacks of the Zombie Soldiers who had been lining up. It seemed that the Zombie Soldiers were not using magic, but rather were launching small pieces of debris at high speed.
Both attacks were effective against giants. Although their race had high resistance to magic as a trait, these attacks appeared to be physical attacks, and thus rendered their traits meaningless.
Low-level warriors without regenerative abilities were helplessly beaten.

Fortunately, the enemy's defenses were no better than those of ordinary undead. The battle was a long-range firefight, inflicting considerable damage on both sides.
The Long Wall built by Luminas may have been the reason for this strategy, but it was not fun for Dagruel to be having a difficult time against an opponent who would not normally be a threat to him.

"Give me a break. I didn't think that I was underestimating Rimuru, but I was wrong. I never thought that my little soldiers would be defeated by a bunch of low-class undead!" Dagruel unintentionally complained.

Dagruel remembered his old memories, and it wasn't like his personality had changed. He did not dislike Rimuru, and neither did he want to be enemies with his old friend if he could help it. However, Dagruel's heart was ravaged by memories of when he was an ancient god, when they had been freely rampaging just to dominate the planet.
He had made a show of his existence by rebelling against the god Veldanava.
And Dagruel believed that this was what Veldanava wanted.

A child surpassing its parents---it was a pure wish.
He could not disappoint god by failing to live up to those expectations.
There were those who had been forced to carry the burden of the God Killer.
Dagruel was one of them.
That is why he could not stop.
Even if it meant betraying his friends, even if he didn't know if it was the right thing to do.
Dagruel suddenly remembered something.

"Ever since that day when she murdered my friend Twilight, Luminas and I have been at odds with each other. This is another reason why we must fight."

That's right, Luminas, the demon lord whom Dagruel recognized as his rival, had committed parricide.
He held resentment, jealousy, and respect towards her for the murder of his best friend. With these mixed emotions, Dagruel held complicated feelings towards Luminas.
Suddenly, he had a thought.
About Dagruel's sons, Dagura, Liura, and Debura.
He could tell from their presence that they were on this battlefield.
Even though they were enemies this time, he wondered what kind of battle they would show.

Because of their pampered upbringing, his sons were only strong in power but not so strong in ability. They might be like ordinary demon lords, but in the face of the "real thing", they were sure to be crushed by a single touch of the armor.
Dagruel loved his sons, but he did not expect much from them.

No.
He had never dared to train them because he did not wish for them to bear the fate of parricide.
It was absolutely impossible to defy the Creator.
However, his sons were free from the curse.

*That's right. I will follow my own path. That's why you should live freely in the way you believe!*

And of course, to enjoy freedom, one needed the strength to protect it.

"Big brother, what about the boys?" Fenn asked Dagruel in an amused tone.

"I get it. If they stand before us as our enemies, we will beat them up with no mercy at all! If they can use that pain as fuel, that's good, otherwise---"

They would only fade to nothing.
That was the absolute rule of this world---might makes right.

*I hope you've gotten stronger. At least to the extent of not being intimidated by me.*

Dagruel had no hesitation.
He would simply fulfill his duty.
Simple and straightforward, Dagruel was a warrior through and through.

![break]

And then, it was only a matter of time until the titans' rampage violently swept across the war zone.


![hard scene break]


As Adalmann and his team started to fight, Shion was ready to go.

"You heard me, boys. I won't say much. But do you understand what we have to do?"

" " "Uuooooooo!! We'll take the equipment from the enemy and prepare it for ourselves!!" " "

Shion's subordinates were indeed the best of the best.
They were able to read their master's thoughts accurately and showed their motivation.
Seeing this, Shion nodded her head in satisfaction.
The Yomigaeri and Shion's fan club had now grown to a surprisingly large scale.

Shion was finally beginning to think about the cost of equipment, but that was a problem that Gobzo and the others had been worrying about for a long time now.
And they had given up.
Since Shion's subordinates were all capable people, it was agreed that they should be able to obtain weapons and armor by themselves. Therefore, it was acceptable for them to be ill-equipped, but this time, they had a chance to procure equipment in an absurd way.

Gobzo was the only one who thought they might get scolded later, but since this was the usual case, he agreed to it without worrying about it.
Looting in war was an act that should normally be prohibited. Looting from civilians was also never allowed. However, disarming the enemy in order to neutralize them was allowed.

As one could see from Adalmann's use of the weapons taken from the imperial army, it was often left to each commander to decide what to do with the equipment acquired from defeating the enemy.

*Fufufu, even Adalmann provided his own equipment for his subordinates. There's no way I can't do it too!!*

Thus, Shion had a high self-esteem.
She had thought about asking Rimuru to help her, but changed her mind, thinking that she was being too spoiled. In this respect, Shion had grown up, but she still had a long way to go if she was jumping for the easy way of robbing from the enemy.

However, this time, it helped to boost the morale of the subordinates.
Shion was also suddenly motivated.
After all, the army of giants in front of them was wearing large armor. They could take all the materials they wanted.
It brought a smile to everyone's faces.

![break]

Now, as for Shion's subordinates, the Yomigaeri numbered less than a hundred, and all of them were treated as executives. It was as it should be, as even the weakest of them were classed as Over A rank by Rimuru, who had named them after the death oni tribe.
They were hornless demons, and they were completely individualistic, with some of them recruiting subordinates from the fan club and others pretending to be lone wolves.
There were a few oddballs who appeared as young girls but had a large number of men in their ranks. It was a group where anything was possible.

And then there was Shion's fan club.
This group was led by Dagura, Liura, and Debura. The honorary president was Gobzo, but this did not mean much as he was more of a chore boy.
This fan club was also known as the Terror Knights.
The total number of those who were skilled in combat was as many as 3,000, consisting of various races of the Shion faction. They had been trained through the past battles, and just like the death knights, they had grown up to be an elite group equivalent to A-minus rank.

In this battle, they were to be the main force in the truest sense of the word.
The only problem there could be was---

"Is it really okay? If you want to go back to your father, now would be the time."

The relationship between Dagruel and Dagura and the others.
Father and sons.
They were worried that they wouldn't be able to seriously kill each other due to lingering familial affection.
They did not think that any of the brothers would betray them, including Shion. They were only concerned about whether they could fight seriously or not.

"Gobzo is right. You can come back after the war is over, so there is no need to push yourselves too hard."

Shion also called out to them.
However, Dagura and the others only laughed cheerfully.

"Don't worry! Whether it's our father or our uncle, we'll beat them to a pulp!"

"Right! Let's show them what we're really made of!"

"Heheh! My stomach's rumbling."

*His stomach is rumbling...?* For a moment, Shion wondered just what this guy was talking about.

...Although, Debura's comments were always strange. Well, he was fat, and it probably couldn't be helped. However, Shion still thought that it was by no means a sign of motivation.
All that said, it was too much trouble to get into it, so she just let it pass.
If they were saying it would be all right, it would be all right. The problem was with their uncle.
Rimuru had told her that Dagruel's change of heart had something to do with their uncle. Apparently, there were two of them, and one of them in particular was a very troublesome person.

"I hear that Dagruel has a brother, tell me what you know."

Shion asked the question straightforwardly, feeling that she should have asked earlier.
In response, Dagura and the others opened their mouths obediently.
Their reactions were quick, as they had no intention to hide anything.

"Yeah! I heard there are two of them. My uncle Glassord, who is my father's second-in-command, took care of me a lot, but I've never even met this Fenn guy."

"From what I heard, he was too dangerous and was sealed up? The story that he beat our father is also a bit unbelievable, but if the rumors are true, it's possible."

Shion nodded her head, though she didn't get much information.

"I see, Dagruel-dono was indeed strong. I would also like to ask him for a match, but if Fenn and the others are as strong as him, they are definitely a threat."

Judging by the fearless smile on her face, she did not seem to think of them as a threat at all.
Debura was encouraged by Shion's confidence, and he took advantage of the situation to copy her.

"Well, if you leave it to us, whether it's our father or our uncles, we'll have no problem!"

Upon hearing this, Shion started to feel somewhat uneasy.
There was a saying, "One man's fault is another man's lesson^[Another Japanese proverb "hito no furi mite waga furi naose." Just like it says, it means that one should learn how to fix their behavior upon watching another's problematic behavior.]," and that's exactly what was happening in this case.

"But still, you should be on your guard," Ultima advised Shion. "Dagruel is seriously strong, and to be honest, it would be tough even for me if I didn't take it seriously."

Shion agreed with this opinion.
She wanted to challenge him, but she didn't think she could win.
Shion, who had been in close contact with Dagruel, simply wanted to test her strength against the warrior Dagruel.

"Even so, it's hard to believe that he betrayed us."

"Mm, perhaps he betrayed us, or perhaps he had something he wanted to do? Well, there's no use thinking about it since it will become clear once we beat him."

Ultima answered Shion's question in a matter-of-fact tone.
Dagruel was a naturally occurring indigenous god. They were super-living creatures that have lived far longer than the present human beings. Such long-lived species were usually acquainted with each other and had certain relationships with each other.

Perhaps he knew Feldway, too, Ultima thought, and if that was the case, the word "betrayal" would be questionable.
Whatever the case, she couldn't come up with the answer no matter how much she thought about it.
Now that they were enemies, there was no need to do anything about it, and justice would side with the victor.
Shion agreed with Ultima's thoughts.

"In the past, I would have gone off on my own and challenged Dagruel-dono to a singles combat."

That is what the old Shion would have done, not thinking about whether she could win or not. It was something everyone could agree on.
Even now, Shion was thinking that it would be faster if she went and defeated Dagruel herself. As expected, she understood that such an outburst was a bad idea now that she was in charge of an army...

"And yet, I am now able to consider a strategy like this. I think I have become a well-rounded person."

Shion praised herself in such a way, inwardly satisfied with her growth.
No one agreed---or so they thought, and it was here that Debura made a foolish remark once again.

"Eh? Shion-sama is not fat at all though?!"

Upon hearing this, everyone thought the same thing.

*He's dead.*

Debura was the youngest of the three brothers, and no matter how much he ate, he seemed to only grow horizontally, as if he wasn't getting enough nutrients to his brain.
He was the biggest idiot of the three brothers, and the most easily carried away^[Same word "ochōshimono" was used here to describe Debura as was used to describe Gabil in a previous footnote. Easily carried away, a luck-pusher, someone who readily chimes in, etc.].
He lacked the ability to read the atmosphere even more so than Gobzo, and would make gaffes such as these without thinking.
And, of course, his comment infuriated Shion.

No, Shion was not fat, nor did she care about that, but she was angry, so it couldn't be helped.

"Really?"

And then, with a very bright smile on her face, Shion clenched her fists and punched Debura in the stomach.


![full page image](image8.jpg){Shion abusing her underlings: One Punch Shion.}


It was the infamous corkscrew punch.

"Fucking idiot...learn for a damn change!" she said to Debura, who was lying on the ground.

"I-it's a reward..."

Debura fainted with a big smile on his face, looking happy for some reason.
And his two brothers were looking at him enviously.
Although not as stupid as Debura, these two brothers were also idiots.
Shion, who was dealing with these three brothers, was feeling something frightening at the same time as feeling stunned.

In fact, she was rather impressed by them.
This was because she was gradually losing the need for restraint against them.
For example, Debura had only fainted even though she hit him quite seriously, and his body itself was still in good shape. In terms of endurance alone, he was definitely the best among the three brothers.
There truly were some frightening people in this world.
Yes, in many ways.

However, if they were her comrades, she could reliably count on them.
Shion truly believed in these three men from the bottom of her heart.

![break]

And Shion quickly changed her mindset.
Glancing at Dagruel's sons---Dagura, Liura, and Debura---Shion's mind wandered.

In any case, the Long Wall must not be breached.
Beyond the Long Wall lay an unprotected sacred land, and beyond that lay the sphere of human civilization.
That terrain was tricky at best to defend, and its loss would mean the end of Rimuru's ideals.
For Shion, this was something that could not be tolerated. Shion engraved this fact in her heart once again.
Just what was the true extent of Dagruel's power?

*He is said to have been an even match with Veldora-sama, so there is no shortage of opponents!! Even if I lose, we still have Ultima and Luminas-sama here. The one who wins in the end will---*

With Dagruel, there were his two brothers. In addition, there were powerful beings that had yet to be seen.
Shion's will to fight would not be discouraged in the face of an enemy whose strength was unknown.
In the worst-case scenario, she was determined to destroy Dagruel here, even if it meant the loss of her entire army or even her own downfall.

"Listen up! We let Adalmann make the first move, but the real hit comes later! Let's show these fools just what we can do!!" Shion declared loudly to her fellow members with high morale.

In response, a roar of cheers rang out.
It was like a group of fans attending an idol concert.
For Shion and her followers, nervousness was nothing to worry about.
Shion smiled fearlessly. That smile encouraged and empowered her allies.
Ultima, who had been listening to the exchange between Shion and the others, smiled in amazement.
Shion's eyes were already the eyes of a predator aiming for their prey.

*I'm sure she understands that Dagruel is a superior opponent, but she has a great mentality. I should learn from her too.*

She also secretly respected her.
For Shion, even an army of giants seemed to be nothing but food for her own improvement.
That ultimate positivity was an ideal that Ultima, a spiritual life form, wanted to see and learn a lot from.
It was no wonder that Diablo recognized Shion, and Ultima intended to do her very best to support Shion.
Therefore, she would interject at the right time.

"Shion-san. The operation is going well as planned, so we should probably start preparing."

As she pointed out, Adalmann himself was about to make a move to shift the current battle situation, which had turned into a back-and-forth stalemate.
The war had just begun.
From this point on, things would only become more intense.


![soft scene break]


Adalmann jumped onto the back of Wenti, who had revealed her true nature as a gehenna dragon.
Wenti was soaring high into the sky as she had been waiting for him. She had reverted to her original form of a wicked dragon and was happily scattering ominous youki.
That youki would normally kill a weak human instantly, but to Adalmann, it gave him the power to fight back.
Perfectly comfortable, Adalmann glared down from above the battlefield.

"They're doing just fine," Adalmann muttered.

The lower-ranked undead soldiers had been rendered incapacitated by firing all their missiles.
They were simply waiting to be overrun, but since they were essentially small fry, they should be praised for fighting the good fight.
That's what Adalmann thought as he nodded to himself.

"Well, I'm about to launch an inhumane attack now, but should I give them a warning?"

*No need,* Adalmann thought.
They were incompatible with invaders.
Adalmann, who had come to that conclusion, was supported by a voice coming from beside him.

"Well, now. This is not a one-on-one duel, so there is no point in making any verbal statements. Rather than abandoning our superior position fairly and risk losing, we should seize the victory, however cowardly it may be."

This comment came from Gadra, who had been following him with flying magic.
As expected of his best friend, Adalmann laughed.

"That's absolutely correct. At the very least, let us unleash a flashy and extremely powerful magic, and knock our enemies out of their minds."

"Then it's a competition. Let's see who is better today!" Gadra responded happily.

Then, Adalmann and Gadra quickly began chanting spells.
Both of them were now able to cast magic without chanting. However, when it came to the use of extreme magic, it was more comfortable to chant the spells to unify the mind.
Especially in the case of Adalmann, he had a firm image that magic was something performed by borrowing the work of god. He spun words of prayer as if giving thanks for his good fortune of having been given the Ultimate Gift 'Necronomicon'.

Adalmann chose a forbidden summoning technique that could not be used inside the labyrinth.
The area of influence was too wide, so the damage was difficult to predict.
Adalmann chose this magic because he did not have to worry about the damage on this battlefield.
Naturally, this was a secret magic that was not known to the general public, and even if a human did have knowledge of it, it was said to be impossible to use.

According to ancient literature, it was said that several great mages had attempted it but failed. The reason for this was partly because it was difficult to control, but also because the process of integrating individual magicules did not work.
In fact, Adalmann was also nervous about whether he would succeed or not as it was the first time for him to use this kind of magic.
However, he chose it only because it seemed to be the flashiest, so even if he failed, that would just be a story for that time. Gadra would laugh at him, but he would simply unleash a different kind of magic if that happened.

With that in mind Adalmann, determined the area of influence of his spell without any hesitation.
Although the magicule consumption was high, it was not a problem for Adalmann who boasted a magicule count on the level of an awakened demon lord.
Preparations for casting his spell were completed without any problems.

*Ah, I see... This explains why there is no need for spell chanting.*

Filled with a pleasant sense of fulfillment, Adalmann fully grasped his power.

"Now then, Gadra, pay close attention. This is the greatest ancient magic: Tempest Meteor!!"

It appeared that once the spell was successfully cast, the mantra was engraved in your mind, and you could cast it again instantly by simply selecting it. Confirming his ability in such a way, Adalmann released the spell.
In that moment, a gigantic magic circle suddenly appeared in the sky with a dazzling shimmer, and light poured down on the earth.
As beautiful as a starry night miracle---and yet, it was a terrifying light that called for death and destruction.

This magic bore the name of the country that Adalmann and his comrades loved. They liked that and it was chosen for that very reason. It also possessed a terribly destructive power that lived up to its name.
The magic that the great magicians of the past had wished to achieve had come into full effect in this world.
The light that poured down on the earth were meteorites.

Over a thousand meter-sized meteors were covering the earth with destruction.
No matter how many giants boasted of their 'Ultraspeed Regeneration', it was meaningless if the damage was too severe for them to recover from.
The area of effect was too large, and there was nowhere to run.
Limbs that tried to catch the meteorites were blown off, and heads were crushed.
The giants, who had intended to overwhelm the enemy with their brute force, were crushed helplessly by an even larger force.

Adalmann's extreme magic was more effective than he had intended.
In a very short time, he had incapacitated as many as 30 percent of Dagruel's army.

"Behold, Gadra! I've already won, haven't I?"

The impact of the meteors caused a huge explosion. Looking down at the boiling earth, Adalmann declared victory.
He was surprised at the power of the explosion, which was more powerful than he had expected, but still boasted about it as if it were a matter of course.
Bone faces had no facial expressions, so it wouldn't be recognized.
Adalmann was more than happy to show off to his rival.

However, this was not amusing for Gadra.
What Adalmann had used just now was one of the secrets of dark magic, a summoning magic that applied *imaginary matter*. It was the ultimate magic to create imaginary meteorites and summon them.
The imaginary matter that appeared in the world would become *real* under the influence of the laws of physics. The effect was temporary but lasted long enough to destroy the enemy.

*What's this, why does he remember this kind of magic?! This isn't 'holy magic' or 'necromancy', but rather 'summoning magic' which is more like 'dark magic'---that's my specialty!!*

Truly, Gadra could not give in to this.
If he lost to something outside of his field of expertise, there would still be an excuse. However, this was a direct challenge to Gadra.
He had to acknowledge the power of 'Tempest Meteor', and he admired his best friend's amazing work, but as a master of magic, he could not simply admit defeat.
Above all, Gadra himself had just joined Diablo as his subordinate. He wanted to take a shot at something big here.

And it was.
The survival of the human race was at stake in this war, but from another perspective, this could also be seen as a battle for supremacy in the world. In that case, Gadra thought it would be a good idea to gain some kind of recognition here.
If he did so, then at least he would not be abandoned by Diablo.
That's why Gadra lashed back in a spiteful manner.

"Keep talking! I'll show you the true essence of magic!"

With these words, he completed the magic he was constructing.
He had been reborn as a metal demon and was now able to use the ultimate magic.
Gadra made full use of the Ultimate Gift 'Grimoire' and unraveled the knowledge from the source of magic.
This magic, which even Adalmann did not know about, was the essence of dark magic taught by Diablo and Ultima.
Gadra had spent his spare time steadily begging to learn from them.
The culmination of his efforts was:

"Come, all those who suffer from eternal hunger! Devour all with your fangs!!"

'Nihilistic Parade', dark magic of the most vicious caliber.

It was well-known that the most powerful holy magic was 'Disintegration', the ultimate destruction magic against people and objects. It was also famous for the fact that only a few people could use it, but its high power was guaranteed. It was said that no one could survive a direct hit.
However, there were a few drawbacks.
The most notable of them was the narrow range of influence.
Even if it was the most powerful anti-personnel magic, it could not be used against entire armies. That is the kind of magic it was.
Incidentally, the existence of dark magic, the counterpart of 'Disintegration', was known only to a very limited number of people.

This was the dark magic 'Nihilistic Banish', which Ultima and others excelled at.
It was a terrifying magic that devoured the target with the emptiness that came out of hell. Moreover, this magic's range could be expanded.
This time, Gadra had set the area of influence as the entire battlefield. He exerted all his mana into 'Nihilistic Banish' and completed it as 'Nihilistic Parade', the magic of wide-area extermination.
Just as the magician intended, an extremely large magic circle appeared on the ground and in the sky.

Then, as if connecting heaven and earth, a dark electrical discharge commenced---countless numbers of dark spots were released. They were the fangs of darkness that devoured all matter.
It was the forbidden dark magic art, the manipulation of the forbidden void.
The void unleashed in this world would not disappear until its negative energy was brought to zero. It filled the inside of the magic circle barrier that connected heaven and earth, causing it to disappear.

It was one of the ultimate magics that could destroy the world if wielded incorrectly.
As soon as the magic was invoked, Gadra smiled widely.

"Wahahahah! What do you think? Isn't it amazing?!"

He seemed so innocent and overjoyed.
Adalmann, however, was not so much.

"You idiooot!! What are you thinking?! What would you have done if this dangerous magic failed and went out of control?!"

With the Ultimate Gift 'Necronomicon', he understood the danger of 'Nihilistic Parade', and his face was pale as he shouted.^[He's a skeleton though...]
Gadra, however, did not take offense and replied without hesitation.

"Because I want to show off, too!"

Adalmann was deflated after hearing this.

"No, I don't think that's..."

Throwing away all dignity, he had intentionally spoken his true feelings. Adalmann was taken aback by Gadra's childish comment.
Indeed, it was difficult for Gadra to make any excuses because it was true that the world could have collapsed if he failed to control the spell. Therefore, on the contrary, he opened up and spoke frankly.

"W-well, it's fine. We have succeeded!"

Gadra made an irresponsible remark that things would be fine as long as they were together.
Even if he was rotten, Gadra, who showed no sign of remorse, would still be an insane genius.
Recognizing this once again, Adalmann released a big sigh and gave up.
It was useless to say anything anyway, and in fact, there was no problem since he had succeeded.
The enemy forces had been greatly reduced in number by the two extreme magics, and they were on the brink of destruction. Their numbers were already less than half of what they had been at the beginning, and in a normal war, they would have given up and retreated long ago.

Although the visibility was poor due to Gadra's 'Nihilistic Parade', they seemed to be on the verge of successfully defeating the enemy.
Adalmann and his team, who hoped that the war would end in this way, looked upon the situation below with bated breath.
Sure enough, the result was...


![hard scene break]


Dagruel recognized the danger of the magic at first glance.
He had been planning to overrun the city as soon as the war started, but the small fry stopped him in his tracks. And just when he thought they had reached a stalemate, his troops were reduced by more than 50 percent with that extreme magic.
This was a miscalculation on Dagruel's part, but it was not a great loss for him.

Although it was kept secret from the public, magic could not defeat the giants. A person who died by this means was not only out of luck, but also out of ability.
He could overlook the falling meteorites with a smile.
In fact, he praised it as splendid magic, and even thought of using it to determine who would be qualified to participate in this battle.

If it had been an attack such as dropping a huge rock stored in a different space from the sky, he would have judged that it was too destructive to ignore because of the positional energy added to its mass. However, since 'Tempest Meteor' was an attack of magically created meteorites, the power of giants could counter it without any problems.
A warrior should not be late in using magic intended to be used against a group.
In fact, none of Dagruel's core members nor his main warriors were lacking or even stopped.
That was the correct thing to do.

However, the magic invoked by Gadra was no good.
This was because 'Nihilistic Parade' penetrated and damaged even the absolute power of 'Magic Nullification' possessed by True Giants.
The anti-magic guard 'Magic Nullification' automatically neutralized all kinds of magic attacks. Because of this ability, magic could not normally defeat giants. Therefore, even an extremely powerful magic like 'Tempest Meteor' could be overlooked with a smile. Those who would die from such magic would be dismissed as immature...

"That Ultima, she spread those forbidden spells so carelessly..." Dagruel complained, thinking of Ultima's innocent smile.

Only the kings of demons should know about the magic that invoked the emptiness of hell. As for the perpetrator who spread it, the one who came to mind the most out of the seven was Ultima.
Or Raine.
Mizeri was serious, so that wouldn't happen.
With Guy, Diablo, and Testarossa, these three surprisingly had common sense, so they were excluded from the list.
Carrera...was a possibility, but Dagruel judged that she should be excluded because she was not good at teaching others.
In that case, Ultima or Raine were the most likely suspects.

So then, the culprit would be Ultima, who appeared to be good friends with the immortal Adalmann and his comrades.
That was the correct answer, but Dagruel wouldn't be happy to know that. Now was not the time to be looking for the culprit.
Fortunately, Dagruel could deal with this magic.
With a bitter look on his face, Dagruel raised his hands to the sky.
Then he released his power.
The attack characteristic of nihility magic was the annihilation of existence through negative energy. If that was the case, it meant that the damage could be forced to zero if the positive energy became saturated.
Dagruel was a giant that could be called a mass of energy. Even if it was a 'Nihilistic Parade' with all of Gadra's energy, it was no problem for him to offset it.

![break]

Dagruel's army marched forward.
Accepting the deaths of their comrades, they overcame them as if nothing had happened.
In their eyes, they had the utmost trust and loyalty to Dagruel. They walked the battlefield as if there were nothing to fear.


![hard scene break]


"I-I can't believe it..."

"Dagruel-dono is the real deal. He neutralized such dangerous magic so easily..."

The two of them were at a loss for words.
As soon as the 'Nihilistic Parade' was drowned out, the giants resumed their march, seemingly unconcerned by the deaths of their comrades.
The formation had been previously broken by extreme magic, but before they knew it, it had been rebuilt.
Thanks to their extraordinary resilience, those who escaped instant death were regenerated as if nothing had happened---the number that were thought to have dropped significantly turned out not to be the case.
Their appearance was so eerie that it aroused fear in those who confronted them.
Adalmann and his team were fed up with seeing the movements of Dagruel's army.

"Good grief...don't they feel any fear?"

"Tell me about it. Normally, they should be thinking of countermeasures or pulling out for a while..."

It was troublesome to become enemies with those who did not understand such common sense.

*Well, the same is true for Rimuru-sama's subordinates.*

That's what Gadra thought, but he was not stupid enough to say that, so he pointed out something different here:

"More than that, I'm curious. It can't be helped that Demon Lord Dagruel erased the void, but how did he endure the 'Tempest Meteor'? It seemed to me that the meteorite disappeared unnaturally, but..."

In other words: *Yes, it was as if the magic had been drowned out.*

This was something that had bothered Adalmann as well.
It appeared that some of the lower-ranked giants had suffered casualties, but the elite warriors of the higher ranks were all unharmed.
They had expected them to be injured at least a little, if they recovered at all, but it was unnatural that they did not even have that.
The two men looked at each other, searching each other's thoughts.
They quickly decided that there was no answer to their question.

"So, what do we do now?"

"Mm, I used too much mana. Let's pull back for now. Even so, I'm glad that my army is an Immortal Legion that does not fear death."

"That's true. A deathless army of giants is a nightmare, but your subordinates are similar..."

The two let out a sigh as they spoke to each other.
The unbelievable reality that came right after they had expected to win was a great shock.
Adalmann stroked Wenti on the head and ordered her to return.
As they had originally intended, they had succeeded in striking the enemy with extreme magic. There was no need to stay longer.
Rather, they should quickly return and report the threat of Dagruel's army.

It was their steadfastness and resilience that was to be feared.
The opening act was over, and what came next was the clash of the major forces.
However, considering the threat of the giants that they had just witnessed, it was likely that the Immortal Legion would not be enough.
Their lack of fear and ability to resurrect was similar. Nevertheless, he had a feeling that the giants could overrun Immortal Legion with their overwhelming destructive power. He could envision a future where they would be crushed and shattered before they could even deal the giants a decisive blow.

Well, that's just the way things were.
All they could do was reduce the number of giants by killing as many of them as possible.

"Anyway, we should go back and report to Shion-dono."

"You're right. As for the future, we will need to discuss that."

Adalmann and Gadra return to Shion's location, thinking about future developments.

![break]

Shion received the report.

*Now then, what to do?* she wondered.

Shion was standing on the Long Wall and had a bird's eye view of the battlefield.
She had witnessed Adalmann's and Gadra's extreme magic and thought that perhaps they would be able to win the battle, but in truth, a harsh reality was awaiting them.
Even without any report from Adalmann and his team, Shion had already recognized the danger of the enemy.

![break]

Two hours had passed since the battle began.
The battle had shifted to the next stage, a clash between the main battle forces.
Although the Chained Titan Army appeared to have greatly reduced its numbers from 30,000, the actual attrition rate was less than 10 percent. Now, they had formed an assault formation with their elite at the top and were clashing with the main forces of the Immortal Legion.

The formation was a crane-wing formation^[Crane wing formation is kind of like a U-shaped formation with a concentrated striking unit in the center, and two wing units on the side flanks. It's a good way to target and eliminate units on the battlefield (main force strikes while wing units support and prevent escape) while also preventing a heavy loss of forces.] with 2,000 death knights in the center and 10,000 Bone Soldiers with secret weapons on both flanks. They were trying to surround the advancing Chained Titan Army but were outnumbered and could not enclose them.
It was a tactical error, but Adalmann was unfazed.

"Is it okay?"

"There is no problem. We will show those who do not know fear the true horror of *dead soldiers*."

Adalmann, who was commanding from beside Shion, had not intended to win from the beginning.
His objective was to reduce the enemy's strength.
The real main forces were the Yomigaeri and Terror Knights under Shion and the Bloody Knights under Luminas. In a sense, Adalmann and the others were expendable pawns.
As much as possible, they wanted to take out as many of the Over A rank warriors on Dagruel's side as they could. At the very least, they wanted to find out the enemy's weak points. That was the intention behind this plan.

Naturally, Adalmann was also satisfied with this strategy.
Regarding this matter, it was simply what had been agreed upon before the war started. It was the consensus among Rimuru's side to avoid casualties as much as possible.
This was also an effective strategy for analyzing the giants' strength.
The Immortal Legion was immortal, so they would not be counted as dead. After all, Adalmann's subordinates would not die, even if they were killed.
The key to this strategy was to play towards the strengths of immortality, that being a suicidal attack strategy to strike and eliminate lured giants in order to reduce their numbers.
Nevertheless, there were limits.

At first glance, the battlefield appeared to be in a stalemate, but the momentum was tilted in favor of the titan forces.
The Bone Soldiers launched suicide attacks, triggering the mana that filled the battlefield. The death knights finished off the wounded and fallen giants, but unless it was a sure fatal blow, the giants would revive.
The problem here was the giants' enormous stature.
The giants boasted huge bodies of 3 to 5 meters, and their muscular armor was so thick that it was difficult to deal a fatal blow to them. If too much time was taken, they would be crushed.

At first, things were going well, but as time went by, countermeasures were put in place.
Those with long weapons were being kept in check, and they could no longer approach carelessly. If they tried too hard, they would only be crushed like pieces of wood, and once that happened, the Bone Soldiers, who were inferior in strength, had become useless.
The death knights were also outnumbered and forced to fight hard, and their numbers gradually dwindled.

![break]

At this point, tensions were running through the Bloody Knights led by Louis, who was thinking that it was about their turn.
Shion also tried to deploy her reserve Terror Knights.
The 2,000 death knights were still almost intact.
If she added 3,000 Terror Knights to them, she was sure that they would be able to fight against the giants' top fighters.
The number of Bloody Knights was four hundred, whereas there were a thousand Over A ranks. To close the gap, the Yomigaeri alone was not enough.

Shion thought that they could manage if there were ten fighters against one.
Shion was usually someone who thought that she could get by with her own spirit, but she did not want to see any casualties among her proteges. But here, as a commander, she bit his lip and tried to give the order.
But Adalmann stopped her.

"Oh dear, it seems that I'll have to make a move."

Adalmann, whose mana had been recovered, climbed back onto Wenti's back.

"You still have a plan?"

Adalmann replied to Shion's curious question with a clattering laugh.

"I've run out of ideas, so it's just a matter of what will happen."

With those words, Adalmann returned to the battlefield.
Adalmann activated a modified version of necromancy that he had been developing in preparation for this moment---the 'Immortal Legion Creation.'
It was Adalmann's favorite because it was named after his own legion.
The effect of this magic, which had a special effect over a wide area, was astonishing.
Within its sphere of influence, it transformed the dead who died on the battlefield, regardless of whether they were friend or foe, into undead soldiers who were loyal to his orders.

This was the forbidden secret of necromancy.
It was the culmination of Adalmann's research.
Moreover, this magic had been improved to reconstruct the nucleus of those who had already died.
In other words, in this case, the shattered Bone Soldiers began to gather around the death knights.
Dead giant warriors and even warriors who were still active gathered themselves together.
And thus, 2,000 death giants were born.

The magic weapons made of magical steel worn by the death knights covered the huge bodies of up to four meters in height. Because this was an amalgamation of the grudges of the deceased, it was no wonder that the armor had been transformed according to the will of the owner.
Adalmann had been anticipating this from the very beginning and had devised this secret of creating immortal giants.

"You're kidding, right? That Adalmann, not even I had any idea he was preparing a hidden gem like this..."

Even Shion couldn't hide her surprise.
It was only natural as each of the death giants was an Over A rank monster.

"I can't believe it. I've never been happier to have you guys as allies," Louis said, who was watching the battle beside Shion.

![break]

Thus, the battle situation was reversed once again.
The giants, who had been dominating with their power, had lost their advantage due to the emergence of a greater power.
Moreover, the death giants were immortal. Even if they were crushed or destroyed, they would be instantly resurrected under Adalmann's power.
Even so, the giants were not defeated.
The report of nearly 1,000 high-ranking fighters was false, and in fact, there were more than 2,000 elite fighters in their ranks.

And with the Over A rank fighters, their wounds would instantly be regenerated by 'Ultraspeed Regeneration'. They were invincible as long as they didn't take instant-death damage, and they were evenly matched with the death giants.
The number of fighters on both sides did not decrease, and the battle reached a stalemate once again.


![soft scene break]


Thanks to Adalmann's efforts, Shion and her team were able to relax.
It was a happy miscalculation that they had not been told about such a trick.
However, Adalmann had not wanted to create any strange expectations since this 'Immortal Legion Creation' was its first public presentation, or rather, it was a spur-of-the-moment event.
The result was what happened just now, and the person who was the most relieved was Adalmann himself.

"As expected of my best friend."

Gadra was also very happy.
Louis could only nod in agreement.

"It's true. The Seven Luminaries did such a foolish thing. I can't believe they let such great talent go elsewhere."

He spoke with serious regret.

.........

......

...

Louis remembered the old days.
In those days, Adalmann and Albert were famous.
Adalmann, a genius of holy magic and a high priest.
Albert, the strongest Holy Knight of all time.
Both of them were qualified to be heroes.
However, neither of them possessed a hero's egg.
Still, they had naturally reached the level of sages, and if nothing had happened to them, they would have reached the level of saints.

But both of them were simply much too talented.
That is why the Seven Luminary Clerics were jealous of them and had pushed them into a trap.
The Seven Luminaries feared that if those two continued to grow, they would become a threat to their own positions, and so they took measures to keep Luminas and the others in the dark.

As he recalled, it was the cleansing of the large-scale dead spirit disaster. But in reality, this turned out to be a battle with a zombie dragon prepared by the Seven Luminaries, and the two sides were killed by each other.
They had gladly accepted the request and went to the Great Jura Forest. But since they did not return to the holy city, they were presumed dead.
Not even Demon Lord Luminas, Louis' master, could have expected that they would fall into the hands of Demon Lord Kazalim after their death, nor that they would fall into the service of Demon Lord Rimuru after that through some strange fate.

.........

......

...

Luminas was frustrated, and Louis felt the same way.
They should have included these champions into their ranks at any cost.
And Albert, one of those champions, was just now drawing his sword on the battlefield.

"Hoh, that man was Adalmann's subordinate. You can clearly see from a distance that he has tremendous skill."

Shion, who had regained her composure and was watching the battlefield, exclaimed in admiration.
Dagura, Liura, and Debura, who were standing behind her, nodded their heads in agreement.

"Albert-san is seriously cool!"

"He occasionally meets me in hand-to-hand combat, but he's really strong, that guy."

"Oh, he's facing Uncle Glassord! I wouldn't be surprised if either of them won!!"

At first, the three brothers were trying to support Albert, but their attitudes changed when they saw his opponent.

"He's strong. So, there was a giant warrior who wielded a sword."

"Yeah. That's our father's younger brother."

"He's second-in-command of the Chained Titan Army."

"That's our uncle who was our teacher!"

Dagura and the others replied to Shion's mutterings.

His name was Glassord.
He was a top-notch two-handed swordsman and one of the strongest in the Chained Titan Army.
Although he was inferior to Dagruel in terms of the total magicule count, his swordsmanship was said to be superior.
He was said to be mild-mannered and intelligent for a giant.
Incidentally, the Dagruel of today would be considered calm if he were only more mild-mannered, but he was still feared due to his old notoriety.

This Glassord was dueling with Albert.
Wielding a greatsword with his two-meter frame moving gracefully, Glassord clearly stood out from the others in terms of strength and was a unique presence on the battlefield.
Albert, on the other hand, was crossing swords equally regardless of the height difference.
It is an unbelievable sight for those who knew Albert as a top-notch swordsman.

Despite his huge stature, Glassord was able to perform sophisticated techniques with his agile movements. No one other than Albert would have been able to compete with him, and on the contrary, Albert might be the one who was abnormal for being able to compete with such a person.
He was able to parry and even counter the heavy pressure attacks that would have normally crushed him with a single blow. This was only because he had been given a set of mythical-grade equipment.
If he had been equipped with anything less than legendary-grade equipment, he would have been destroyed the moment he was hit.
Incidentally, one of Glassord's hidden characteristics was his 'weapon destruction' ability he used on his opponent's armor.
This literally meant that anyone who crossed swords with Glassord was destined to be defeated unilaterally by having their weapons and armor destroyed.

It was fortuitous that Albert, who was unaware of this, was equipped with mythical-grade weapons. It was a miraculous coincidence, and even the three Dagura brothers could not have known it.
Thanks to such good fortune, the collapse of the front line was narrowly averted. It was ironic that no one noticed it.
The threat was there, but the danger went unnoticed as the battle between the two sides heated up.


![soft scene break]


Shion and her team were in spectator mode, in contrast to the battlefield where even the strongest players had finally made their moves.

"However, Father hasn't moved."

"Since Uncle has already left, it must be about time."

"We'll take care of things at that time!"

The three brothers were so excited that they even said such things.
Shion replied, stunned by such idiots.

"Don't be hasty. Of course, I'll be dealing with him. You guys lead the Terror Knights and keep out of the way."

The three agreed without protest.
It was not that they thought they could win. They were just in a good mood, so their replies had been relaxed.
Still, they did not forget to give warnings while fooling around.

"I understand, but you shouldn't underestimate our father, okay?"

"Big brother is right. No matter how strong our mistress is, our father is a true monster."

"Heheh! I've never been able to beat him."

It was not even a matter of winning or losing, but rather, it was difficult to even stand in front of that haki. It was obvious that the three brothers could not even compete.
From Shion's point of view, these three were reasonably strong men. They were growing stronger and improving with every mock battle, and she was looking forward to seeing their growth.
Shion could certainly sense the seriousness of the three brothers.

"Don't worry. I, too, will not do anything reckless."

It was a very Shion-like comment, as if coming from someone who didn't know what they were like.
There were no shifts in the battlefield, but her turn would soon come. Shion was prepared for battle, feeling it firsthand.

*Rather, shall I just go all in at once?*

Waiting did not suit her and breaking this stalemate to grab the victory at once might be a good strategy.
Right now, as long as they could do something about the enemy general, they were sure to win the battle...

That was what Shion thought.

![break]

Suddenly, a change occurred on the battlefield.
It was abrupt and harsh.
The battlefield was suddenly a no-man's land. Several death giants were blown away like pieces of wood.

"*That's?!*"

Shion's eyes widened.
Every time there was a glimmer of silver light, a death giant of Over A rank was knocked down with ease.
Standing there was a slender man of extraordinary stature, his body bound by multiple layers of chains.
Even when sealed, the chains failed to hide his intense and foreign presence.
It was a presence that surpassed even Dagruel's.
Shion's whole body was covered with goosebumps.
Her survival instincts were telling her with all their might that this man was dangerous.

"Th-that's... I see, that's the sealed..."

"Is that the Crazed Fists^[Previously called "Mad Fist" Titan, but "Crazed Fists" Titan was later chosen by others.] Titan^[The word used here was not the same word for giant/titan (kyojin) that is normally used, but rather "kyoshin" which can also mean "divine giant" or "giant god"] who was feared as both a god of war and a raging god of evil, Uncle Fenn?!"

"Heheh, I'm hungry!"

Debura's inane comment earned him another corkscrew punch to the gut.

"Are you full now?"

Shion changed her mind after saying that.
Thanks to Debura's stupid remark, she was relieved of her tension.
An idiot, but a lovable idiot is what Shion thought as she observed Fenn.
He was over three meters tall, but it was his chains that were more eye-catching.
It was no wonder.

"Are those chains Gleipnir? That's a tremendous thing, isn't it?"

"Gadra. What is that?"

"Yes. It's from a myth recorded in an ancient text that predates human history..."

As if his wish had come true, the ever-garrulous Gadra began to show off his knowledge.

.........

......

...

Gleipnir.
Since mythological times, these chains have been used to keep the rampaging evil gods at bay.
If that story was true, then the chains would have evolved by absorbing the magicules released by the evil god.
Since that time, the chains have been a sacred weapon of the Dragon Emperor, sealing both the holy and the evil. It was no wonder that these chains had a performance that surpassed even that of mythical-grade chains in the current era.

But it wasn't the chains that one should really fear.
It was the evil god enclosed in those chains who was the threat that one should be wary of.

.........

......

...

"In mythological times, it is said that the evil gods were sealed away by the Dragon Emperor. It seems said that two of the three brothers reformed, but one of them remained violent, so he was sealed by the chains of god. In other words, that is Fenn who is raging there, and the chains that bind him are the famous Gleipnir."

Gadra spoke with great joy.
As if to prove his words correct, the chains wriggled and pulsated.
Despite being bound by such suspicious chains, Fenn was smiling.
It was as if to say, *I'm having fun.*

The chains were moving on their own and knocking down enemies without Fenn doing anything. Not even Over A rank warriors could stop them.
Shion was astonished.
Fenn's existence value was said to be comparable to Dagruel's, but it seemed to be surpassing Dagruel's by a long shot.

"That's funny. It's said that there is always someone better than you, but to think that he is so exceptional..."

Most of Shion's comrades also boasted a fairly high magicule count, and they had grown beyond comparison from the past, but Fenn was in a realm that even they could not reach.
The pinnacle that Shion knew. He was in the class of Veldora and Velgrynd, the True Dragons.

"That guy is an unimaginable monster. It's impossible for you guys."

Shion affirmed that.
On top of this, Dagruel was also waiting.
It was depressing just thinking about it.

"What will you do? Do you think we can't win and should withdraw?" Ultima asked innocently.

Shion thought about this in a disinterested way.
No matter how much the battle was going back and forth, the board could be easily overturned by the appearance of such a monster.
As Ultima said, running away was also a good option.
Rimuru did not want any casualties. If they followed his orders to the letter, they should consider retreat.
Now that Adalmann and the others were enduring, it would be possible to escape from this place with just Shion and the reinforcements from the monster country.
However...

It was easy to retreat, but the consequences were obvious.
Those who were left behind, the innocent people living in this land, would be deprived of all their rights through an unreasonable tyranny.
And that would involve even the sphere of human existence, destroying the realization of Rimuru's ideals.
What should they do then?
Even if she fought against this monster, annihilation was inevitable.

No, that's wrong.
Shion was here to make sure that didn't happen.
She had her answer.
It was not a difficult problem.
Shion prepared herself to fight as she made up her mind.
This was also easy as she had done it many times before.
The confidence of having been in critical situations multiple times and overcoming them was what kept Shion motivated.
And it was not just Shion.

"Ultima, which do you prefer?" Shion asked, and Ultima smiled as if to say, *I knew you wouldn't run away.*

"I like that about Shion-san."

"Well then, since you and the old man hit it off so well, I'll take that one over there," Ultima responded innocently.

They decided who would fight whom as if they were discussing their favorite dessert.
Their exchange ended on a light note.
It was decided that Ultima would fight Fenn, and Shion along with her fellow leaders would fight Dagruel.

![break]

Following this, Luminas's team began to move.

"Well, well, like master, like subordinate. It seems that Demon Lord Rimuru's subordinates know nothing of fear."

Stunned, Louis also announced his participation in the war.
His eyes were met with the sight of a rampaging four-armed giant.
It was Basara, the leader of the Five Warrior Generals, and the maternal uncle of Dagruel's sons.
There were several other strongmen in various parts of the battlefield who caught their attention. Following Louis, the Bloody Knights and the Seven Great Nobles also ran out to face them.
Thus, the battlefield became even more chaotic.


![soft scene break]


A sandstorm was raging over the battlefield.
Fenn moved, and the chains danced. As a result, a large number of death giants were broken into pieces.
Fenn's eyes caught the sight of Adalmann, who was taking command on the back of the gehenna dragon Wenti.

His battlefield strategy was to target the generals.
In fact, Fenn's action was the correct one, since Adalmann's power was what made the immortals immortal.
Fenn swirled up a cloud of dust and ran at a tremendous speed. He was now in flight, closing in on Adalmann with a force that ignored the presence of anyone standing in his way.

"Ngh?!"

Adalmann noticed Fenn's approach and tried to deal with him. He was not sure if he was safe in the air, but Fenn was moving too fast.
As if Gleipnir were of an infinite length, gehenna dragon Wenti was tied up without regard for space.
The chains were of a mythical-grade that would seal even the gods, so there was no way for Wenti to escape. She was slammed to the ground, unable to move.
Adalmann escaped as soon as he could, but Fenn did not miss it.

"You're in the way! You're dead!!"

He shouted in a straightforward manner and attacked to get rid of the interloper.
Adalmann expected this.
From the very beginning, he had protected himself with multiple barriers so that he would not be caught by surprise.
And yet, with only a single blow, Adalmann was knocked to the ground and rolled over.
It was an extremely heavy blow.
It was a blow of such absolute violence that it took away not only his will to rebel, but also his will to live. Adalmann experienced it firsthand.
A terrible silence fell upon the battlefield.
In an instant, Fenn had taken control of the battlefield.

![break]

Meanwhile, Ultima had also started to make her move.
Before the battle began, Ultima had a secret meeting alone with Luminas. Luminas, who understood the threat of Dagruel, had predicted this situation.
Violence would overturn everything. Knowing this well, Luminas had devised all possible ways to win the war. She wanted to defeat Dagruel even if it meant using the absolute best-kept secret.

Dainty even in the midst of the battlefield, Ultima set out for Fenn with ease as if taking a stroll.
She then stood to protect Adalmann.
She looked at Fenn and laughed, as if to say, *If you take something from me, I'll take it back.*

"That's pretty good. Even I recognized Adalmann's ability," Ultima said.

Adalmann, like Ultima, was one of the Twelve Chaos Guardian Lords. Although he specialized in providing logistical support, the title of Gehenna Lord was not just a fancy name.
Fenn was simply too strong.
Ultima, perhaps not amused by this, immediately judged Fenn.

"Eh, I see. So he's weak?"

Although Fenn had knocked Adalmann to the ground with a single blow of his aura-clad fist, he was not even proud of it. He did not brag because he thought of this as a natural result.
Ultima saw through Fenn's thinking and thought that it was just as well.
Since she was the same way, she could understand Fenn's feelings.
From the perspective of the strong, the weak were nothing but toys. Ultima, who had reigned as a king of demons until now, had no right to complain to Fenn.
The difference in their strength had been too great. Fenn did not care about him.

This time, Ultima was thinking that she was on the side of the underdog, and that's all there was to it. Even so, she had no intention to give up easily.
As Ultima loved fights, she would try to win until the very end, even if she lost.

*As long as you keep trying, you will eventually win someday. In that case, there's only one thing to do.*

She was very much at ease with this idea.

"Allow me to introduce myself. I am Pain Lord Ultima. What about you, Brawler-kun^[She calls him abarenbō-kun. An abarenbō (暴れん坊) is "rambunctious kid/wild child" or a "hooligan", or "brawler", or "roughneck" and etc.]?"

"You cheeky brat. I'm Fenn. You're gonna die here anyway, so why bother remembering!"

As soon as they introduced themselves to each other, the fight was on.

![break]

Shion, who remained on top of the Long Wall, was waiting to see how Dagruel would react.
No matter how Shion dealt with Dagruel, it was obvious that the war would collapse the moment Shion lost.
Luminas seemed to have some kind of plan, so a part of her mind had hopes for it.
But that alone was not enough.
One could not win a battle, expecting miracles to happen. Shion was determined to take the victory, even if it was by force.

"So that's our uncle, Fenn, huh? Hey, hey, even I didn't expect such a monster..."

"Big brother is right. Th-this is even worse than I expected."

"Uncle Glassord is great too, but Uncle Fenn is something else."

"Yeah. No wonder they sealed him up..."

Next to Shion, Dagura and Liura were discussing their impressions of their uncle whom they had never seen before. They had been talking about how they were going to beat their father, but now their spirits had been dampened.
It wasn't that unreasonable, Shion thought.
Only a fool who did not know himself would think that he could win.

"Heheh! If he's that skinny, I can easily beat him with my weight!"

Yes, just like Debura, who only says this...

*Debura really needs to be punished,* flashed through Shion's mind.

![break]

Suddenly, the situation changed.

"Hm. Looking at me from such a high place...you've sure got a lot of time on your hands, don't you?"

The voice came from behind Shion.
This was the top of the Long Wall, and although it was the front line, it was also a defensive base. Naturally, the magicule repellent barrier was in operation, and the area around Shion was covered with 'Multilayer Barriers'.
To ignore all of that and be standing here...no, it was more than that.
The problem is that Shion had been completely unaware of any of this until he had spoken here.
She had not neglected to monitor him.
Even with a Skill like 'Spatial Transportation', she should have been able to detect anomalies. Shion, who could perform 'Spatial Domination', had her surroundings well protected.
And yet, Demon Lord Dagruel was there.

"Why is Dagruel-dono here?" Shion asked, as she turned to the giant standing behind her on the Long Wall.

Dagruel answered gently.
His past aside, he was surprisingly a gentleman now.

"Hm. I was walking slowly, but could it be that you didn't see me? If so, you are not even qualified to stand in front of me. It would be foolish to take you seriously."

"I beg your pardon?"

Shion did not feel that she was being mocked.
On the contrary, she felt that Dagruel was speaking the truth in a very gentlemanly manner.
From Dagruel's point of view, Shion must have been like a little girl.

Now she understood.
Shion had met Dagruel many times before, but now his intimidating presence was like a different person. Dagruel was undeniably radiating the air of a ruler.
However, Shion silenced him with her spirit.
She repelled the intimidation and came forward.

"The one who decides if I am qualified will be me! War Lord Shion. As Demon Lord Rimuru-sama's most trusted secretary, I shall face you!!"

Shion introduced herself, adding a few extra words on her own. Then she pointed her sword Hercules Deluxe at Dagruel.

*Some kind of Skill or trick...even if there is a difference in ability, there must be a reason for this phenomenon!!*

Any movement based on spatial interference would always leave even the slightest trace behind. Even if it was a high-speed movement, it was impossible that there would not be even an oscillation of the air.
Shion told herself not to be fooled by Dagruel's bluff.
But if this was---

*Hmph, what's the point in even thinking about it? At that time, I'll simply have to scatter gracefully!*

Shion cleared her mind.
If the answer was as bad as she imagined, then admitting it would be the same as losing. She decided that there was no point in even thinking about it, since further protests would be pointless.

*With Luminas-sama behind me, it is my duty to analyze Dagruel's strength, even if only a little!*

This bold decisiveness was one Shion's strengths.
Shion let out a roar and fully immersed herself in combat mode.
Her body, optimized with the Unique Skill 'Cook', helped Shion increase her strength beyond her existence value.
Shion's body was made highly suitable for close combat with 'Infinite Regeneration', surpassing even that of a giant. Physically immortal, she would not die unless her 'heart core' was shattered.

Even now, Shion was responding to her wishes by easily accepting forces beyond the limits of her body.
The full force of her blow in that state was so great that it was almost to the ultimate realm.
Shion exposed her full power from the very first move, intending to bury Dagruel.

"Oh no! Get everyone out of here!! This whole area will be wiped out!!"

Gadra, who had been looking around for cover, shouted, and in response, Shion's group quickly evacuated.
Immediately after that, Shion slashed at Dagruel.
Without paying any attention to her surroundings, Shion's consciousness focused only on Dagruel.
Dagruel, however, remained steadfast.
He looked at Shion with a pitiful gaze, "I guess that's all there is to it," and muttered to himself.

And then there was a result.
At the moment Shion's sword made contact with his head, it was held in place by an invisible pressure.

"Wha?!"

Between Shion and Dagruel, there was a wall of compressed fighting aura. It protected Dagruel and blocked Shion's sword.
The fighting aura was extremely dense, enough to blow away Shion's spirit. Because of this, Shion's slashes couldn't even touch Dagruel.
At this point, it was obvious that the current Shion was no match for him. Her defeat was certain.

"As expected, you were not even qualified to stand before me."

Shion's eyes widened in surprise, and she suddenly stopped moving.
Dagruel did not miss it, but there was no need to take advantage of the opportunity, so he remained calm and did not move.
He simply told her gently.

"My only aim is Luminas. I won't say anything bad, so don't get in my way."

Shion was not convinced by this admonition.
Burning with more fighting spirit, she began to challenge Dagruel.


![soft scene break]


Thus, battles had begun in various locations.
The Dagruel side was currently in the lead.
In such a situation, Ultima was fighting a desperate battle next to Shion.

"Isn't this strange? Why are you so unconcerned when my nuclear magic Nuclear Cannon is hitting you directly?"

Even if she was showing her frustration with Fenn, she couldn't currently afford to be as relaxed as her expression appeared.
Ultima did not like to admit it, but Fenn was strong.
Even now, she was using her Ultimate Skill 'Poison King Samael' to enhance the power of Nuclear Cannon, adding a 'Deadly Poison' effect, yet Fenn did not seem to care.

"I don't know. It must be tough to be a weakling; you need to work hard and learn some tricks to even be able to fight," Fenn laughed mockingly.

"So annoying, even though you're just a brat."

Ultima was calmly analyzing the battle situation.
She had not thought that she could beat Fenn from the start, and it was simply a matter of not losing.
However, there was something strange going on here.
Just like the magic used now, there was a sense of frustration that could not be explained simply by the difference in their abilities.
It was as if something had been overlooked.
And then, she suddenly remembered that there had been an interesting report.

That's right, it was as if the magic had been drowned out---that's what Gadra had said.
The meteorite attack had not been as successful as expected. She initially thought it was because of the giants' superior regenerative abilities...

*Come to think of it, the damage wasn't as bad as they thought it would be, right? Or rather, it seems that only the low-ranked warriors were injured...*

They were weak and were either injured or killed---it was not unnatural if she only looked at it from that point. However, it was unnatural if one really thought about it, the fact that there was no one who appeared to be injured from among the elite warriors.

*It's as if the magic didn't work...?*

That was the idea that came to mind.
No way, no way, no way---Ultima's instincts sounded a warning bell.
If that was true---Ultima began to grow impatient; she had to let Luminas know as soon as possible.

![break]

Around that time...

Shion continued to attack even though she understood that she could not communicate with Luminas.
It could no longer even be called a battle.
It was like an infant throwing a tantrum, and Dagruel didn't seem to have any respect for her.
Still, Shion did not give up because she believed that Luminas had a plan.
Shion and Luminas had been getting along surprisingly well.
In a way, it could be said Shion's cooking had only become decent because of Luminas.
That is why Shion trusted Luminas unconditionally.

"Good grief, you just never give up. No matter how many times you repeat this, you won't even be able to scratch my skin."

"Keep talking! The warm-up exercise is finally over, so it's time to get serious!!"

As if not to lose her spirit, Shion tried to slash at Dagruel again.
However:

"I said you're too naïve!!"

Dagruel's roar suddenly stopped her from making such a move.
Just by hearing Dagruel's voice, Shion became unable to move as if in paralysis.
Dagruel calmly walked up to the motionless Shion and then shook his clenched fist towards her.
With just that, the corner of the Long Wall where Shion and the others had been standing came crumbling down.
Even 2,000 years of history was powerless against that violence.
And not to mention Shion, who took the direct hit...

It was not a sad story, but merely the natural law of the Jungle.
It was simply a case of the absolute strong using violence to eliminate those who stood in the way of their will.
Thus, Dagruel's victory was all but assured---but Shion had a smile on her face. It was because her eyes caught the light of a magic circle shining at Dagruel's feet.
And the next moment...

"You are the one who's naïve!"

A dignified shout rang out with a force that seemed to blow away the dust that had been flying around in the air.
A beautiful and radiant girl in a jet-black dress appeared with a sweet rose-like fragrance.
The silver-haired girl who fluttered down in front of Shion was Demon Lord Luminas, the ruler of this land. She was staring at the Demon Lord Dagruel with her gold and silver heterochromatic eyes which held an intelligent will.
And then, without a moment's delay, she completed the trap that had been set.


![full page image](image9.jpg){Luminas getting ready to unleash a big attack, Shion kneeling in the background: It's blood sucking time.}


"Now perish. 'Sanctuary Disintegration'!!"

Filled with the deadly intent to kill, it was the crystallization of the prayers of the people of the Holy City---that would have sounded good, but in reality, this was the product of Demon Lord Luminas's ability, 'The Secret of Faith and Grace', which had caused a limit break in the computational domain and gathered the sacred power of the congregation.
The greater the number of believers, the greater the power that could be gathered. It took some time, but it was well worth it.
The fact that the most powerful anti-personnel magic could be increased in range was an astonishing feat. With the strongest 'Disintegration' unleashed in this way, even a giant like Charybdis could be obliterated in an instant.
Dagruel, who had been caught off guard, had nowhere to run and had to take a direct hit from 'Sanctuary Disintegration'.

"Hmph, you let your guard down, Dagruel. Guys like you create an opening the moment you are sure of your victory."

Dagruel had gotten more chances than she expected. Luminas was worried that Shion might have been killed if the "fight" had continued.
No matter how powerful Dagruel was, a direct hit of 'Disintegration' would kill him. However, Dagruel's defensive membrane of fighting aura was so thick that it was difficult to break through it.
That is why she set up a maximized 'Disintegration' that could envelop Dagruel.

Luminas did not like the idea of hiding and watching, but she had no choice but to do so in order to win the war. Luminas had been observing the war situation for a long time, patiently waiting for the right moment to make a move.
That patience paid off, and she was rewarded with the best result.

"Don't take this personally."

Luminas was confident of her victory and sent her best wishes to Dagruel.
If Luminas and Dagruel were to fight head-on, the odds of Luminas winning were very small. Knowing this, she did not consider it cowardly to carry out this strategy.
She had planned in advance so that she could win, and she would win. This was her way of life.
She showed her most powerful blow against Dagruel, who had been caught off guard, without even revealing her secret moves. It was a perfect strategy, and if that was not enough, there was no other way.
That was why...

![break]

"Hm, well that's true. Did I let my guard down too? But it doesn't matter. Because I have not been damaged."

![break]

...Those words made her freeze.
Luminas's lucid mind correctly recognized the impossible reality.
In other words, Dagruel was truly unharmed.
That made one fact clear.

"Luminas, is it over now? Then I guess it's my turn next."

That's right.
If they failed to defeat Dagruel with their current attack, there would be no way for Luminas and her side to win.

"Watch out! If you're not careful, you will die instantly."

Dagruel's declaration signaled the beginning of the time of despair.


![soft scene break]


The one-on-one battle between Albert and Glassord had intensified.
The area around them was wide open in a circle, as if nobody else could be caught in the middle of it.
But that kind of thing did not matter to them.
They recognized each other as their rivals and were enjoying the battle.

"Kukakakakaka! I am impressed with your skill. To be able to cross swords with a man of your caliber is a credit to your military prowess!"

"This power is not mine. This armor given to me by our god Rimuru-sama lends me strength. If I had remained as I was before, I would have already been defeated, unable to withstand the pressure of your sword."

"Hah! Don't be modest! Even among the titans, there are few who can match me. To be able to use that armor is proof that you are first-class."

Albert coolly accepted Glassord's compliments.
In fact, it was Albert's own ability that was bringing out the performance of the mythical-grade armor. The fact that Albert was not prideful because of it proved that he was not satisfied with his skills, and it was also a strength of his that he did not get disturbed by the words of his enemies.

*Hm, as expected of him.*

Glassord was also impressed.
In a momentary battle of swords, the one whose mind was disturbed first would lose. Deceiving the enemy with words was simply another fine tactic.
Then, as if moving on, Glassord continued his words.

"Nevertheless, why do you follow such a man?"

"What are you trying to say?"

"If you have built up that much strength, there is no need to follow a weak immortal skeleton king. It is true that his necromancy is superior, but the true strength of a warrior is in his own body."

He chided Albert in an agitated manner while brandishing his greatsword.
His words were never meant to be true but were intended to provoke Albert into a fit of rage. Emotional turbulence would lead to mistakes, which would immediately lead to death. This was also a tactic of Glassord.
Albert was not pleased to see a true warrior go to such lengths. And yet, his expression did not change at all.

"You seem to have misunderstood. It is true that I am Adalmann-sama's escort and the one in charge of the vanguard. However, you have forgotten something, haven't you? Adalmann-sama is one of the Twelve Chaos Guardian Lords recognized by our god---"

"Huh?"

"Don't you see? In other words, he is stronger than me."

Albert's attitude was one of straightforward honesty.
With his own words denied, Glassord grunted and raised an eyebrow.
However, he said nothing more and held his greatsword up in a poised position.
He recognized that Albert was not someone he could play tricks with.
If so, that was a pity.

"It seems unavoidable. Although I have found a wonderful opponent, this battle is not a game. I have a duty to perform as well, so it's time to get serious."

Glassord was not insulting Albert by holding back. He had been making full use of little tricks to enjoy the momentary battle with Albert, but he was also fighting for his life.
But now that all the tricks and deceptions had failed him, he had to put aside his obstinacy and defeat him head on.

Glassord made up his mind with simple and clear thinking.
He was a warrior by nature, and his skill-level was that of a master. This was because he had honed his skills without relying on just his strength. It was not because he had been weak from the beginning, but rather because it was what he desired.
In other words, his true power had been sealed within his beloved sword, the greatsword.
Now, it had been released.
The change was instantaneous. The sword was now a part of Glassord.
Albert had no way of knowing it, but Glassord's existence value, which was less than 2 million, had then swelled to 10 million.
Even Albert was blindsided by this change.

*Kuh, I should have tried to win the battle earlier, even if I had to force myself...*

Albert thought bitterly as soon as he saw Glassord's swordsmanship. However, he also understood that it would have been a mistake. If he had done so, he would have been defeated before even seeing Glassord's true aura.
There was only one correct answer.
He would have to repeat the same battles they had been fighting, head-on and honestly.

"There is no shortage of an opponent!!"

"That should be my line."

The fierce clash of swords began once again.
Albert was overwhelmingly at a disadvantage. Like a willow caught in a storm, Albert could only fend off Glassord's fury.
However, Albert's eyes showed no signs of giving up.
The battle began to heat up, and soon the two of them were paying no attention to their surroundings, focusing only on their swords.


![soft scene break]


Adalmann appeared to have been knocked unconscious when he hit the ground.
It may have been a momentary event in terms of time, but on the battlefield, this would have been a fatal blunder. Grateful for his good fortune, Adalmann prioritized his understanding of the situation.
Without going back to his memory of what happened, he recognized that he had been hit by Fenn's blow.

It was a despairing force.
Adalmann survived because gehenna dragon Wenti protected him and together they took the impact. And the reason why he had not been finished off was because Ultima had come to his rescue.
Even so, Fenn was one to be feared.
All the 'Multilayer Barriers' that Adalmann had put up were broken through, and only one defensive measure had been effective. Without that defense, Adalmann would have been mortally wounded by a single blow.

*It is strange to say that my already dead body has been mortally wounded. Even so, the magic barriers I was good at, rather than being broken, this is...*

Adalmann felt that he had been ignored.
Incidentally, the remaining barrier was not a magical one, but a protective coating of fighting aura. Without it, Adalmann's barriers would not have been able to be used. Without them, Adalmann might have ascended to heaven.
Although it could be considered a force push, it seemed more natural to think that Adalmann had been penetrated with something. If so, the secret of Fenn's power became clear.

*I see... I didn't think it was possible, but it does occur to me. It seems that there is no doubt that the elite titans possess 'Magic Nullification'.*

That was the answer that Adalmann came up with.
It was the same conclusion Ultima reached, and it was the correct answer.
Adalmann no longer doubted it to be true.
It would explain the low impact of the extreme magic and the fact that his own defenses had been ignored.
Even if he was wrong, it wouldn't matter.
Adalmann was not bothered by the fact that he could not use magic against the giants.
Either way, his magicules had already been exhausted. It did not matter if the enemy had 'Magic Nullification' or not, since it was difficult for him to use magic anymore.

Adalmann, who was supposed to be dying, stood up as if nothing was wrong.
Every bone in his body was cracked and his holy robes were covered in mud.
Still, Adalmann remained unconcerned and looked to Fenn who was fighting Ultima.

*As expected of Miss Ultima. She seems to have already realized that her magic does not work. Moreover, I'm amazed that she has managed to make it an even match with such a big difference in power.*

To be precise, they were not evenly matched. Even a single direct hit would have made Ultima unable to stand up.
Ultima was courageously attacking repeatedly without fearing such a situation. It was precisely because of this that Ultima was able to fight against an enemy whose existence value was more than twenty times greater than her own.
However, the limit seemed to be approaching.

Adalmann had no time to be complacent. The reason why he was not panicking was because he knew that he would be of no use to them if he continued this way.
Exhausted mana and dying bones---that is how one would describe the current Adalmann.
If that was the case, he had better do something before going to help.

"Wenti, are you okay?"

"Yes, I was caught off guard."

Wenti quietly took human form and answered Adalmann's question. She had decided that the damage was too severe and that she should recover even if she had to use her trump card.
Just once a day, Wenti could activate her 'Super Recovery' by changing her physical configuration. From dragon form to human form, or vice versa. Either way, it allowed her to ignore even mortal wounds. In this case, by transforming into human form, she was able to erase the intense damage she had taken on Adalmann's behalf.
He was aware of this power, so he was not surprised and continued the conversation.

"Thank you for saving my life."

"I'm glad you're safe."

"But now we have a problem."

"What do you mean by that?"

"It appears that magic doesn't work on him. At this rate, Miss Ultima is in danger."

"I see."

Fenn's energy was so extraordinary that it was reckless to challenge him in a straightforward manner. For Wenti, who had been thinking of using magic as a support, Adalmann's words came as quite a shock.
Adalmann, however, remained unperturbed.
It was hard to believe that he had used to be a priest. He evaluated Fenn as if he were a researcher.

"That giant is too strong. Even if we could use magic, it would be difficult to defeat him."

Adalmann plainly spoke the truth.
His combat speed, destructive power, and defensive power. All of them were first-rate, and his presence alone was comparable to that of True Dragon. Even if they attacked him with their meager force, they would be crushed.
Naturally, the same was true for Adalmann's magic.
If so, said Adalmann, then they needed to change their approach.

"Oh dear. It seems that it's time for my well-trained body to make its appearance for the first time in a long time."

"Huh?"

Wenti loved and respected her master Adalmann, but those words could not go unheard. She let out a questioning voice as if to ask, *Did he hit his head? He has a crack in his head, so I wonder if he is conscious? Perhaps he is not in his right mind? Or maybe he is talking in his sleep while dreaming...* She looked at Adalmann with suspicion.

It was only natural.
Let alone a well-trained body, Adalmann was nothing but bones.
What was this skeleton talking about?
As if to answer Wenti's question, Adalmann spoke to her in a frank manner.

"I didn't mention it. Although I held the position of high priest, my real job was something else."

"Y-yes..."

"Actually, I was a Sacred Fist Master, which was the highest rank for priests and warriors."

"Is that so?"

There was no need for Adalmann to fight in close combat because he had Albert, who was an excellent escort and could play the role of a vanguard. So, before he knew it, he had become a rearguard and a healer.
This was because it was more efficient, but that did not mean that Adalmann abandoned his abilities. He was still active as a fist fighter.
The fighting aura which saved his life was proof of this.

"When I fought you, I didn't think it would be effective against you who are not humanoid, so I didn't have the chance to show you my techniques."

"O-oh I see..."

Wenti was at a loss for words.
She had known him for hundreds of years, but this was the first time hearing this truth.
Or rather, if he had such special skills, there should have been more occasions to make use of them.
Even Wenti, who admired Adalmann, knew of a few unacceptable stories here and there.

"It seems that you have been convinced."

"Eh, no. But that...eh? Wait a minute?!"

"Is there a problem?"

"Uh, aren't there a lot of things?"

"Hohoh. What are the specifics?"

Wenti was at a loss to be asked such a question, but she at least had to ask this one, so she spun out her words.

"I certainly don't think so, but can it be that you are planning to face that giant with your bare hands?" Wenti asked, hoping he'd deny it.

She had known Adalmann for a long time but had never seen him in physical training once.
No, she didn't even see the point for a skeleton to work out...

I didn't matter if he used to be a Sacred Fist Master or not...
Fenn was too powerful of an opponent to challenge with such uncertain information...

In short, Wenti was not enthusiastic about this.
And yet, Adalmann was determined.

"Fufufu, that's a foolish question. I am a fist fighter, so it is only natural that I use my bare hands, right? Do you still have doubts?"

That's not what I meant---is what Wenti wanted to retort, but all she could manage was a "No, nothing..."

Adalmann's momentum was too overwhelming.

*I see. I now understand that he was deceived by his former allies. Adalmann-sama seems intelligent, but unexpectedly---*

She stopped that line of thought and turned her eyes to the rampaging Fenn.
Now that things had come to this point, she would have to trust in the lord whom she loved and respected.
Although it became doubtful whether she truly respected him, Wenti decided to entrust everything to Adalmann.

"Very well then. I'll tell you what we're going to do. Magic doesn't seem to work, so we'll hit him with physics. This is the only way."

Wenti wanted to go home just by hearing this. But she persevered and listened to the next part of the plan.

"Of course, your breath will not work either. This is because the principle of 'Magic Nullification' involves interfering with the spiritrons themselves, which make up magicules."

Surprisingly decent---though it would be rude to say so---Wenti was surprised to hear that Adalmann was still reliable.

However, what he said next was, "In other words, we have no means of attack. So here is a suggestion. Let's combine!!"

"...Yes?"

Adalmann's plan was beyond Wenti's imagination.
Frankly, it made no sense.
Nevertheless, Adalmann took Wenti's reply as an affirmative.

"Fufufu, I knew you would say that!"

"Eh, wait, that's not---"

Wenti's denial came too late.
Or rather, Adalmann, who was not listening to her, invoked his technique without a moment's pause.

"Now is the time to show you the secret technique I've been developing just for this sort of thing!!"

Wenti's body was getting weaker and weaker...

The secret technique that Adalmann invoked was 'Assimilation by Possession'.
She wondered how long he had been developing this technique, but it seemed to be succeeding without any problems.
Adalmann, as a dead spirit, was as close to a spiritual organism as possible. It could be said that he was possessing his dead body, i.e., his skeleton. By doing so, he could have an influence on this world, but what he was possessing did not necessarily have to be the skeleton.
In this case, he possessed Wenti as if he was possessing his own body.
This alone was not enough to be considered a secret technique.
The question was whether or not their consciousnesses would be mixed.
Unlike possession, in which another person's body was taken away, it was necessary to protect the consciousness of the subject. Because Adalmann had solved this problem, he was proud to call this a secret technique.

"Don't worry. Your consciousness is still intact even though you are possessed, right?"

<Y-yes...>

"Well, I'm a little nervous about separating later..." Adalmann muttered quietly.

Wenti is not the kind of person who would miss that.
Or rather, she heard it perfectly because the two were one in the same.

<H-hold on?! Are you really sure about this?>

Adalmann replied gently to Wenti's panicked voice, "Even in the worst-case scenario, we can ask our god Rimuru-sama to prepare a new body for us!!"

Wenti thought that this was a brazen statement, but it might be allowed at the very least.
Rimuru also loved experiments, and he would be very happy if they showed him the results of this secret technique.
The real question was which one of them would be transferred to the new body---or rather, before that, Wenti had finally become aware of her current state.
The moment Adalmann possessed Wenti, her body had been transformed significantly.
The magicules of a gehenna dragon and the strong body that supported it were being controlled by Adalmann's steely mentality.

"Hm, this is a nostalgic figure."

Standing there was a dark-haired young man in a jet-black priestly robe.
It was the young Adalmann from his glory days.
Although there were a few differences such as the color of his hair, it was a perfect reproduction of Adalmann's appearance.
Seeing that figure, Wenti though to herself, *Huh? Surprisingly good looking?!Adalmann-sama is a respectable man!!*

Wenti was unexpectedly self-serving, after all.

<I shall leave the rest to you, Adalmann-sama. I wish you the best!>

Wenti decided to put aside her earlier doubts and trust Adalmann completely. Thus, with a strong body and a huge magicule pool, the true Gehenna Lord descended.

![break]

*Fufu, I'm excited for the first time in a long time. In this state, I may be able to compete with Zegion-dono. Perhaps I might even be able to compete with Miss Ultima,* Adalmann thought.

He remembered his comrades who could not even cross fists with him while he was a skeleton. Now, even if he couldn't win, a battle could still be fought.

*Yes, now...*

Apart from Benimaru, Diablo, and Zegion, Adalmann was confident that he wouldn't lose to the other guardian lords.
Adalmann smiled fearlessly and kicked the ground.
His body was light as if he were flying.
Even when he was a skeleton, he had never felt so free from gravity.
Still, the giant Fenn was a formidable enemy. It was suicidal to underestimate him, since even Ultima was on the defensive.

It would have been impossible for Adalmann alone to defeat him. But if he was working with Ultima...
Fortunately, Fenn's power was real, but his skill-level did not seem to be as high as that of Glassord who was fighting against Albert. He had not been able to kill Ultima yet because he was unable to handle the energy level of a True Dragon.
*In that case, there is a chance for victory,* Adalmann thought confidently.

"Let's aim for a complete and overwhelming victory, not just a tactical victory to buy time."

<Adalmann-sama, of course it's possible!>

Wenti also responded in a friendly manner, although the basis for her reasoning was unsure.
It was an exchange of a like-minded master and servant.

"That's right, that's absolutely correct! I am...we are one of Rimuru-sama's most powerful servants---one of the Twelve Chaos Guardian Lords!"

This fact was the source of his confidence.
In the midst of this critical situation, both Adalmann and Wenti were running across the land happily.


![soft scene break]


Damn it, I knew it! Ultima wanted to curse at him.
She was bitterly convinced that Fenn could not be affected by magic.
Worst of all, the plan that Ultima and Luminas had made was to eliminate Dagruel with the most powerful 'Disintegration'.
Even though she wanted to tell her that this was not the way to go, Fenn was not so naive as to allow her to do so. In the end, Ultima witnessed the light pillar of 'Disintegration' shining in the distance, realizing that the operation had failed.

"The insectars also had someone who could nullify magic, but this is different."

"Hahahahaha!! So you noticed. Our 'Magic Nullification' is an anti-magic guard. Because it blocks the movement of spiritrons, no matter what kind of magic is used, it won't work!"

"How kind of you," Ultima replied with annoyance and sarcasm.

Magic was a demon's strongest weapon, so giants were also their natural enemies. It appeared to be a characteristic of only the elites, but the compatibility was so bad that it was almost laughable.

*Shit!! Guy definitely should have known about it. I wish he would have told me...* she inwardly complained, but Guy was not there to hear it.

It was now that Ultima truly understood the importance of ReCoCo^[report, communicate, and consult] that Rimuru had always talked about.
All that said, it was too late for that now.
She could not give up at this point and had to find some way to tackle the problem. Ultima realized that the clue was in the 'Nihilistic Parade' used by Gadra.

*The reason why the old man went out of his way was because it was dangerous. Why is that?*

The answer was obvious.
Because it had worked.
It had to do with the nature of magic.

Magic rewrote laws by influencing magicules, and since spiritrons were a part of magicules, it was inevitable that 'Magic Nullification' would be an anti-magic guard. However, among the dark magics, nihility magic in particular had the characteristic of invoking the void of hell and making any energy disappear on contact. That is why 'Magic Nullification' could not nullify it.
This was already a certainty.
Ultima did not hesitate to limit her attacks to nihility magic.

"Die, dark magic Nihilistic Banish."

Ultima's nihility magic enveloped Fenn.

"Tch, such a pain in the ass. Demons really are good at harassing people!!"

Fenn's fighting aura drowned out the void but failed to do any damage. 'Nihilistic Banish' was the most powerful dark magic and the counterpart of 'Disintegration', but to Fenn, it possessed no more significance than mere harassment.
Even so, it was not meaningless.
Just as a pile of dust could form a mountain, and just as a drop of water could pierce through stone, repeated attacks would eventually bring Fenn down.

There was plenty of time.
Ultima searched for the path to victory and became more and more focused. She intended to repeat her attacks thousands and thousands of times with such precision that not even a single mistake would be allowed.
If Fenn's attacks hit her even once, Ultima would be defeated. That was how big the gap was. However, speed, the most important factor in combat, was the only factor not so different between the two of them.
That is how the battle between Ultima and Fenn was established.

There was another reason.
It was the difference in combat experience.
Ultima had been trained in combat against Zegion, an overwhelmingly powerful opponent. This was put to good use, and she was accustomed to dealing with strong opponents.
The difference in existence values between Ultima and Zegion was not even by a factor of two. One would think that Fenn, with a difference of more than 20 times, would be more dangerous, but this was not the case.
To use an analogy, Zegion's attack was like a spear. Insta-kill, and if you were pierced, you would die. On the other hand, Fenn's attack was like a huge hammer. It had great power, and even a single hit could do a great deal of damage.
However, that was only the difference between a point and a surface.

The threat level remained the same even if the amount of energy required to kill the enemy was exceeded. Fenn's attack was more powerful than Zegion's, but it was no different from Zegion's in the sense that it would kill you anyway.
Thinking of it that way made things easier.
She was worried about Luminas and the others but had already given up on that. There was nothing she could do by worrying about them, so she had already driven them out of her mind.
Ultima even regained the luxury of humming and began to play around with Fenn.

![break]

And then Adalmann returned.

<Miss Ultima, sorry to have kept you waiting.>

<Who are---no way, Bone?>

<Hahahah, it's Adalmann!>

<Well, okay then. You know what you have to do, right?>

<Of course I do!>

With high-speed communication via 'Thought Acceleration', the division of roles between the two was instantly determined.
Adalmann would play as the vanguard against Fenn, while Ultima would follow up with dark magic Nihilistic Banish to reduce Fenn's stamina.
Now that they had come this far, it was just a matter of work.

"A wild brawler with nothing but brute strength is no match for us, right?"

Although it was a premature declaration of victory, Ultima said this with a wicked sneer.


![soft scene break]


The earth trembled.
The absolute tyranny of Demon Lord Dagruel had dominated the battlefield.

*This is impossible* was the honest impression of Demon Lord Luminas Valentine.

Her plan had been to kill Dagruel by using her most powerful secret technique on the first attack. The moment it did not work, defeat was inevitable.
'Disintegration', which could turn any opponent to dust, should have killed Dagruel. Even the True Dragons would have needed to be reborn in this life.
And yet, the result was disastrous.
Dagruel's 'Magic Nullification', a cheat of a trait, had completely ruined her chances of winning.
At that point, Luminas was able to foresee what would happen.

![break]

The battle between Albert and Glassord continued.
At first glance, the two fighters appeared to be evenly matched. However, if she observed their battle through the Ultimate Skill 'Lustful King Asmodeus', the situation showed a different side.
In contrast to the light shining brightly from Glassord, the light of Albert was so faint that it looked as if it would disappear at any moment. Although the amount of life force that each player could cut was very small, the difference in the total amount of life force implied the victory or defeat.

Before Albert could cut down Glassord, the winner would be decided.
Albert would lose the battle.
However, Albert could not be blamed for this. On the contrary, Albert should be praised for his excellent swordsmanship in a match against the King of Swords.
Glassord was also a master swordsman.
Taking the difference in energy into consideration, it could even be said that Albert's skill-level was superior to Glassord's.
However, that was not enough to change the situation.
At this rate, Albert's defeat was only a matter of time.

![break]

On the other hand, Ultima and the others were fighting a good battle against Fenn.
The battle was growing increasingly fierce, but it had already become a game of attrition.
It was beyond just doing a good job; she was genuinely impressed with Rimuru's subordinates.

The circumstances of Adalmann and the others were unknown, but he had integrated with the gehenna dragon Wenti. Thanks to that, he seemed to have gained a strong body and his magicule count had increased significantly, but still, against the Crazed Fists Fenn, who is comparable to a True Dragon, the difference was obvious.

She especially had a lot to think about with Ultima since she had been a long-time tormentor of Luminas.
She felt a sense of admiration for her, but at the same time, she also felt a sense of bitterness at how troublesome she was.
Luminas was experiencing mixed feelings.
For her, who could quantify life forces, the gap between the two appeared to be hopelessly wide. And yet, they did not give up, and even showed a margin of enjoyment in the battle.

But this was all based on mental concentration, as if treading on thin ice.
In Luminas's vision, she saw Adalmann, who had abandoned his whole-body defense and concentrated his energy only on the areas of contact to cope with Fenn's attacks.
The same was true of Ultima. Ultima was more stable than Adalmann because she could manage energy more naturally, but it would all be the same after a single blow.
In order to make up the difference in energy density, she was concentrating all of her power in one point. It was such an amazing technique that it could even be called a divine art.

However, this technique would not last for a long time, and a momentary lapse of guard could be fatal.
Nevertheless, it went without saying how hopeless it must be; to have to aim for wearing down the enemy's stamina in a prolonged battle.
It was a miracle that the battle was even being fought.
Furthermore, Fenn had not made use of Gleipnir. Once it was in full force, there was a fear that the situation would change drastically.

![break]

And finally, there was Shion.
Shion, who had been knocked down in front of Luminas, had risen again and was challenging Dagruel.
She could sense her determination not to retreat, no matter how many times she was beaten.
However, it was brutal.
The difference in fighting ability between Dagruel and Shion was so great that Luminas, who could read it in the numbers, could not see anything but recklessness in Shion's actions.
Shion was only alive because she was under Luminas's protection. Otherwise, she would have almost certainly died immediately.

Even if Shion had an immortal body, if she was not given a chance to regenerate, she would lose her body. Although it was possible to regenerate from the soul, if not only the material body but also the spiritual body was lost, the "heart core" of the exposed astral body would be shattered, leading to death.
Luminas was preventing this from happening.

*Don't be reckless.* Luminas wiped her cold sweat as she watched Shion.

Dagruel's sons were in a panic, flustered and trying to stop Shion.

"Ah, mistress! It's impossible!"

"Shion-sama! After all, our father---!"

"Th-this is dangerous. You should just run away..."

But Shion was not afraid.

"Shut up!! Rimuru-sama will not be defeated. In other words, I won't lose either!!"

Though this was not very logical at all, Luminas thought that it was just like Shion to reason that way.
And, perhaps because of those words, even Dagruel's sons were enlivened.

"Uuuooooooo! Faaather!! We are your opponents!"

"We've got no choice. I'm reaaady, I've decided!!"

"Let's do it! And then we'll get praised!"

Having made up their minds as they said, they headed towards Dagruel.

"Hoh? You seem to have grown up to be able to stand before me."

Dagruel appeared to be happy, but he had no intention to take it easy on them, and the three of them were defeated in the next instant. They were so badly injured by a single blow that they could not even stand up.
They were still alive, so they must have been treated with a little bit of mercy.

*This is impossible. There is no way we can win.*

Halfway to the point of resignation, Luminas heard Shion's roar.

"Fufufu, good job you guys. That was good spirit. I'll take care of the rest, so you can just rest there!!"

Shion herself was seriously injured by Dagruel.
Even though she was already healed, the difference in strength between the two was still very great...

Even so, Shion stood tall and did not give in.
Her appearance was reminiscent of a very nostalgic scene.
It reminded Luminas of the Hero who saved her in the past.

"Let me help you!!" Gadra said to Shion, following behind her.

But there was no point.
Shion and her team's attacks could not reach Dagruel, let alone even touch him.

![break]

She had arrived at a crossroads.
Should she continue to fight toward defeat, or should she run away from the battle and work to make a comeback?
A wise person would not have had to choose.
Yes, certainly the old Luminas would have retreated without hesitation.
There was no point in fighting a battle that could not be won.
The country could be rebuilt, and there was no reason to stay here.
There was no reason for Luminas and the others, who had eternal lifespans, to fight a life-or-death battle.
However:

*Is that really okay? Is abandoning Shion and the others truly the correct answer?*

Luminas was at a loss.
Since Dagruel's target was Luminas, there was a better chance that Shion and the others would be saved if she retreated at this point.
She thought as much, but she also understood that this was an excuse.
She could not lie to herself.
Shion would not give up, just as Ultima and Adalmann would continue to challenge Fenn. However, since there was no way to win, Shion's death was certain.

But what if Luminas cooperated here?
Luminas power---with the Ultimate Skill 'Lustful King Asmodeus', she could control Life and Death. Even if the others died instantly, they could be resurrected as long as they had Luminas.
If Luminas retreated now, Shion would surely die.
She didn't want that.

*Abandoning my friends, and just running away? Never, I will never accept such an unsightly way of life!! I am the proud Queen of Nightmares!!*

And so Luminas, too, had made up her mind.

"Gunther!"

"Here."

Luminas called out, and Gunther Strauss, her butler-like confidant, appeared like a shadow.
Luminas gave the order without even turning around.

"I, as a proud member of the Octagram, intend to share the fate of Shion here."

"What about the option to retreat?"

Gunther advised that there was no shame in running away.
But Luminas laughed it off.

"Running away in disgrace is not befitting of me. Don't you think so?"

Saying that, she gave a glamorous smile.
It was an alluring smile, not matching the appearance of a beautiful young girl.
Gunther was deeply convinced and remembered.
That's right, a long time ago, when burying the Divine Ancestor, she had smiled just like this.
Luminas had always clung to life, but this was to keep her promise to her friends.
She was, at her essence, a proud queen.
The Queen of Nightmares Luminas Valentine was not someone who ran away.
The noble reigning vampire princess was a supreme being for Gunther and his comrades.

"By your will."

Gunther bowed reverently.
Luminas nodded in return and spoke.

"If I should perish, you may lead the people as the next king."

Luminas's declaration was filled with determination and resolve.
Despite this, Gunther remained calm and unmoved. If a steward was someone who obeys their master, Gunther was unmistakably an apostle of Luminas.

"What is a vassal who forsakes his queen? There is not a single one of Luminas-sama's subjects who would be foolish enough to follow such a man."

"What is that?"

"The evacuation of the people has already begun, but as for me, I am determined to follow the young lady^[He calls her ojou-sama]."

"Mm..."

Luminas was puzzled by this unexpected defiance.
For the first time in his life, Gunther, who had been a faithful confidant of Luminas, disobeyed her orders.

"When we perish, it will be together."

Gunther answered and waited for Luminas's reply, a look of unwavering determination in his eyes.
Luminas was confused, but gradually felt happy before she knew it.

"Hmph, do as you like," she ordered happily.

I don't know who he takes after, but he's an idiot---Luminas laughed happily.


![soft scene break]


"May luck be on your side."

Gunther bowed and left.
Deciding that he would be no match for Dagruel, he went to help Louis first.
He was as capable as ever. Luminas was impressed by him and then stood next to Shion.
Luminas was wondering if this was the right choice, but she did not regret it.

"It seems that your plan has failed, but are you still not ready to give up?"

"Of course not."

Luminas nodded her head in annoyance, and the next moment, she asked with a grin.

"By the way Shion, are you sure you don't want to run away?"

Shion was annoyed at the question.

"Of course!"

The last one standing would be the winner, so even if you couldn't win, all you had to do was survive.

"It's really quite simple, isn't it?"

Shion spoke fearlessly.
Gadra seemed to have a headache but did not seem to have any intention to argue.
Even Luminas was stunned by these two.

"In that case, leave the recovery to me. Even if you die instantly, I will revive you on the spot."

With those words as a cue, the reckless suicidal attacks began.
Shion and Gadra attacked in waves, with Luminas providing support in the rear.
Even though Shion and Gadra were instantly killed by Dagruel's attack, Luminas was truly reviving them. The power of the 'Lustful King Asmodeus' was to be feared, but Luminas's precise measures were also impressive.

And then there was Gadra.
Thanks to his reincarnation as a mysterious metal demon race, he was able to fight a good fight even against Dagruel, a race that was not able to use magic.

Dagruel's 'Magic Nullification' was versatile, but it was not without its weaknesses. While it was able to cancel out all magic affecting the user, it could not negate all the magic effects on other people's bodies.
Body reinforcement magic was a good example. In other words, defense barriers and body hardening could be ignored, but already reinforced speed and so on remained unchanged.
Adalmann's 'Tempest Meteor' was an example. The summoned meteorite was erased because it was imaginary matter, but if it had been a real substance, it would have caused a certain amount of damage.
Suppose that a rock of a certain mass was stored in a different space, and then it was dropped with a flight magic spell. It would be impossible to cancel the positional energy given to the rock. In other words, Gadra's reasoning was that indirect magic could not be canceled.
And he was right.

Gadra had applied reinforcement magic to his body to fight skillfully. It worked.
While Shion was down, Gadra moved forward.
When Gadra was knocked down, Shion quickly took over.
Although it was an improvised combination, they worked well together as if they were a skilled party.
The most important aspect was undoubtedly Luminas's ability, but it was a strategy that would not have been possible without any of the other participants.
Unfortunately, Dagruel was showing no sign of fatigue...

In front of Luminas, Shion rose up again.
No matter how much she was hurt, she stood up again and again without the fear of death.
To the point of simple straightforwardness, she was determined to do what she could do.
She had trust in Luminas.
She believed that Luminas would bring her back to life even from instant death.
Foul language aside, she was straightforward and simple-minded. That was the great thing about Shion.
However, this was not the case with Gadra.

As soon as he recovered from his near-death experience, all his injuries were healed and not even a trace remained. At first glance, it appeared as if nothing had happened to him as he was unharmed. However, exhaustion was accumulating in Gadra's mind.
Unlike Shion, Gadra was intelligent enough to think about how hopelessly they were fighting, even if he tried not to think about it.
This kind of battle could only be fought with an empty mind. The moment one became conscious of his fears and doubts, mistakes would be triggered.

And moreover, the opponent was Dagruel.
He was a demon lord with a magicule count similar to Fenn's, and a skill-level only slightly inferior to Glassord's. In terms of overall strength, he was the most dangerous man among the three brothers.

*Is it okay to leave things as is, or is there anything else I can even do?* Gadra worried.

Gadra's actions were slightly delayed, and this turned out to be a fatal mistake,
It was a minor delay that could barely even be called a mistake, but Dagruel was not so naive as to miss the opportunity.
No, it was the other way around.
It was correct to say that he had been overlooking him, and now he had stopped playing nice with him anymore.

"Oh dear, I thought you'd be more entertaining, but I guess it's a disappointment."

With a big sigh, Dagruel casually punched Gadra.
Naturally, Luminas would heal him immediately, but Dagruel intervened with a surprising move and prevented her from doing so.


![soft scene break]


Dagruel stood between Luminas and Gadra.
At this point, even if Luminas tried to heal, there was no way to get through Dagruel.

"You..."

"Am I in the way? I could have done it this way from the beginning, but I thought I'd see more variety, so I let you do what you wanted. I don't expect you to thank me, but it's not right for you to resent me."

Dagruel's words were true.
From the very beginning, all along, he had been accommodating them. By doing so, Dagruel had been trying to enjoy the fight as much as possible.
He was convinced that he would not lose the moment he made a move.
Dagruel's power was that great.
Despite this, he had given Luminas and the others a chance because he remembered the words of his best friend, the Divine Ancestor Twilight Valentine.

*"You know that kid is my masterpiece. Unlike the others, she is a bundle of potential."*

The Divine Ancestor used to always boast to Dagruel like that.
Although the Divine Ancestor's disciples were quite capable, only Luminas was treated differently from the others.
In Dagruel's eyes, there seemed to be no difference.
In the end, the Divine Ancestor passed away without ever telling him why.
Moreover, his soul had been extinguished by the hands of Luminas, the daughter he loved the most.
The 'Sanctuary Disintegration' used earlier was the special magic that had defeated the Divine Ancestor. But even this had not worked on Dagruel.
It seemed that there were no longer any more "trump cards."
Even so, Dagruel himself had been playing along with the battle, trying to determine the power of his opponent.

But it didn't seem to make sense.
Luminas had devoted herself to supporting the team and showed no sign of joining in on the attack.
He showed her a few openings to attack, but she just kept repeating the same attack pattern.

*No matter how many times you repeat such childish tricks, there is no way that I will be defeated...*

Dagruel felt that he had been taken for a fool. Therefore, he decided that there was no point in playing with them any further. But that did not mean that he stopped being vigilant. It was a rational decision to divide the vanguard and the rear guard.

"You sound as if you were taking it easy on us."

"That's a fact."

Shion was choked up in anger, but Dagruel brushed off her chiding.

"What do---"

"Hm. It seems you don't understand."

Dagruel disappeared.
And in the next moment, Shion was silenced by a fist slamming into her abdomen.
The impact felt as if her insides had exploded. It was not a cute bit of violence that would disappear immediately, but rather one that continued to rampage as if coursing through Shion's internal organs.

*With this, restoration magic is meaningless...* Shion felt.

In fact, with the remaining destructive energy there, it would be meaningless no matter how much she was restored.
Luminas also saw through this at a glance.
That's a problem---she bit her lip in frustration.

"How's that? You must have felt secure in the knowledge that you had someone to protect you, didn't you?"

"Ggh, wh-what the hell..."

"Hoh, so you are still undeterred. Your spirit is admirable, but determination alone won't help you."

Then, Dagruel kicked Shion in the face, seemingly uninterested.
Dagruel had nothing against Shion, and rather liked her. He was going to use this to take away her consciousness so that he would not be disturbed any more.
However, he seemed to have underestimated Shion's stubbornness.

"R-ridiculous! This won't be enough to defeat me ..."

Shion stood up, coughing out blood while smiling fearlessly.

"...Good grief, I must be growing senile. I must apologize for misjudging you."

He had intended to knock her out so as not to kill her, but that didn't stop Shion. Dagruel recognized this and stopped going easy on her in the truest sense of the word.

"You would have been a little better off if you had awakened," Dagruel addressed Shion.

"What are you talking about?"

"It has nothing to do with the dying."

Dagruel said this as a final gesture and clenched his fists.
Upon seeing this, Luminas shouted.

"No, stop!"

Luminas sensed the change in Dagruel and realized that Shion was in danger.
However, Dagruel scoffed at Luminas.

"This person will die because of your cowardice."

"Wha---"

Shion tried to argue but was silenced once again by Dagruel's blow.
She was not dead, but unconscious.
Shion was fortunate enough to have survived, and by no means did Dagruel take it easy on her, but it was impossible for her to continue the battle.
Dagruel was relieved that Shion had passed out because he had not wanted to make her suffer, nor did he want to kill her if possible.

![break]

Finally, only Luminas and Dagruel remained.
Luminas finally made up her mind.

"Very well. It's one-on-one Dagruel. I will take you on!"

Luminas took a stance toward Dagruel and braced herself.
She felt an inner sense of humor from her own words.
Although she had spoken with her pride as a demon lord, Luminas would be nothing more than a piece of dust to Dagruel.

"Hm. Luminas, show me what it was that Twilight entrusted to you. If you can't do that---die!!"

The next moment, a ferocious fighting aura gushed out from Dagruel's entire body.
Seeing this, Luminas realized just how much she had been taken care of by Dagruel until now,
Dagruel did not feel like he was taking things easy, but if he had been in this condition from the beginning, the battle would have been settled long ago.

*He really is a monster. There is no effective way to deal with this, and the only possibility would be to wait for Rimuru to come to our rescue...*

Since the secret plan had failed, there was no way to win a head-to-head battle with Dagruel. And yet, Luminas was still standing here.
For a moment, she wondered if she should have run away, but Luminas laughed and knew that was not the case.
Just what kind of demon lord would she be if she had abandoned her friend Shion, Luminas thought.

*It's strange. I haven't known Shion as long as I've known Chloe...*

She didn't want to fail Shion and the others, and that was why she was still standing here now.
Then she suddenly had a thought.

*That Rimuru must also have a lot of difficulties. He has always worked harder than possible to live up to the expectations of his colleagues.*

For the very first time, Luminas understood Rimuru's feelings.
Except for Guy, Rimuru was the only one who could beat Dagruel.
That, or---

Images of a free-spirited black dragon flashed through Luminas's mind.

*It's just my imagination. It is impossible for me to expect anything from him!*

Contrary to such thoughts, a smile naturally appeared on Luminas's lips.
Dagruel saw this and looked at Luminas with a curious expression on his face.

"Are there any more tricks to this at this stage?"

"Hmph, if I had such a thing, I would have used it long ago!"

Luminas puffed out her chest with pride.
At least until the very end, she would defend her pride as a demon lord by challenging the strong and never running away.

*By some chance, do I also believe? That someone will help us this time, just like in the past...*

In the past crisis, Chloe had helped her.
It was a miraculous event that couldn't possibly happen again.
Even Luminas knew that such a convenient story could exist.
Yet the reason she could think that way was because she had been inspired by the way Shion and Ultima never lost hope.
*That must be it,* Luminas thought.

*Things must be really tough on that Rimuru. Even those who have nothing to do with this, such as myself, can't help but get their hopes up...*

It was strange that she could laugh when she thought about it.

"...Have you come up with a plan?"

"No. It's unlike me, but I just thought that I'd try struggling to the very end."

"Hoh."

"Then, let's go!"

With a great deal of spirit, Luminas opened up her mana to the max.
At the same time, she imbued Night Rose^[Night Rose is her mythical-grade sword.] with the power of 'Lustful King Asmodeus'.

Luminas's "sure-kill" fighting style was to take away the opponent's life force with her death powers, and to convert it into her own energy with her life powers. In this state, a slight difference in strength was not a problem, and the longer the battle went on, the more advantageous it became for her. If the main purpose of battle between elite fighters was to deplete the opponent's stamina, Luminas was quite excellent.

Sizing up this Luminas, Dagruel was also satisfied.
Even though they were his enemies, they were brilliant.
They were wonderful people no matter who he looked at.
They were reliable as allies, and now that they were enemies, they made Dagruel's heart soar.

*Truly, it's a shame to kill her.*

However, he had to avenge the man who was his best friend.
By doing so, Dagruel would be able to fulfill his destiny as a God Killer.
This was the secret agreement he had made with Feldway through Fenn.
Dagruel cooperated with Feldway's ambition to revive Veldanava. After that, the real work would begin.
Moreover, the secret agreement with Feldway did not end there.
If Luminas was defeated, the entire western lands would be under the control of the giants. If the Great Jura Forest was overrun, that land would also belong to Dagruel.
Dagruel's true feelings were *I can't stop here,* because it meant that he would be able to rampage to fulfill his vocation and satisfy his territorial ambitions. Before then, his instincts had already started to run wild.

![break]

Dagruel decided that no further farce was necessary.

"To begin with---" Dagruel began to speak.

At that moment, everything stopped.
All acts of fighting on this battlefield had lost their meaning.

"Once you've done this, you guys can't do anything, can you?"

Dagruel's murmur was the only sound that echoed through the world before fading away.

"...?!"

In a world where only consciousness remained, Luminas was perplexed.

"Hoh, so you're still conscious. Then all that boasting about his masterpiece wasn't for show."

Dagruel's "voice" held a ring of admiration, but a soul-chilling fear struck Luminas.
Luminas was wise and knowledgeable about all things. Normally she might have overlooked this, but now that she was focused on the battle, she understood what was going on.
She understood it.

![break]

*Time...has been stopped.*

![break]

There was despair.

*From the very beginning, there was no way to defeat Dagruel...*

Despite understanding this, Luminas's thirst for life was not lost in the face of these circumstances.
Gathering information in order to survive---all this led to was more despair.
Luminas continued to struggle, even as she fell into the illusion of being swallowed by the bottomless depths of darkness.
Even in the Suspended World, the time of despair does not end.
Luminas closed her eyes in regret.

*For the last time, at the very least, I would take that loathsome and irreverent dragon in my own hands and---*

And, just when Luminas thought that far.
She thought she heard a loud laugh.
It happened the moment that Dagruel's fist was about to reach Luminas.
Luminas's thinking stopped there.

"Kuaahahaha! I am here!"

Luminas understood what that voice meant, and at the same time, she grasped the current situation.
A mighty fist loomed in front of her.
And then, a tanned brown palm caught it.
The evil dragon, who had been absent until now, had caught Dagruel's fist that was aiming for Luminas.

*Just as there is no night that does not dawn, so does time move on with the advent of hope.*

![break]

Just now...

The evil dragon who jumped through time and space, the invincible Veldora whom Luminas hated yet hoped for, had thwarted the attack of the hopelessly powerful Dagruel.
The time of despair had come to an end.
