# Chapter 1: The First|Showdown

In the former Eurazania, at the planned construction site of Demon Lord Milim's new capital, a battle to the death was taking place.
Fighting against the antlion^[For those who might be curious, antlions are basically lacewings and are insects that look kind of like dragonflies or damselflies. In V19, Peliod was described as a feminine insectar with beautiful, long, slender, iridescent wings.] Peliod, was Esprit.

*In all honesty, it's not in my character to fight so seriously...*

The battle was so hopeless that she wanted to complain about it.
Peliod, who nullified magic, was the worst match for Esprit.
Even the nuclear magic Nuclear Cannon, which she shot at close range, was reflected as if it were only natural.
Peliod was able to reflect all kinds of magic with the prism barrier around her. Moreover, Peliod's prism barrier was not limited to magic, but also applied to a certain amount of emission-type techniques.
Peliod was a natural enemy of demons who wielded magic as their weapons.

![break]

At this rate, Esprit would not even be able to buy time. She was bitter at her own helplessness. And then, an unexpected helper appeared.

"Let me help you."

Phobio, who had given up the command of his unit to Suphia, joined Esprit with those words. Although he normally should have been supporting Suphia, each of the Winged Beast Knights was a genuine warrior. They moved appropriately even without being ordered to do so, and their units were well organized. The morale of the whole army was improved when the commander and the second-in-command fought in the front rather than stayed in the rear.
Suphia was usually the one always running off, but this time, Phobio took the lead.

"You know, you can tell this guy is serious trouble, right?"

"Well, yeah. But I'm still a better match than you, right?"

That was a good point.
Esprit specialized in magic, but Phobio's strength lay in hand-to-hand combat. Even against an opponent who cannot use magic, there was a high possibility that Phobio could still find a way.

"Well, I suppose that's right. In that case, I'll fight with this, too."

Esprit decided to use her magic sword to find a chance to win the battle, though she had intended to do so from the beginning.
Thus, Esprit with her sword at the ready and Phobio in his half-beast form were now facing the beautiful and bewitching Peliod.

It was two against one. Even so, they were overwhelmingly disadvantaged in terms of combat strength.
Esprit stepped in and swung her sword.
With such masterful skill, it was hard to believe that she was an amateur until just recently.
While it was true that she only started learning it as a hobby, Esprit had an obsessive personality. In her free time, she practiced over and over again, repeating the katas that Agera had shown her. The result was the brilliance of her technique, learned in a very short period of time.

But sadly, Peliod was always one step ahead.

"Tch, it's a fake. It's so elaborate that you can hardly distinguish it from the real thing..."

That's right, the moment she was sure that she had cut her, Peliod disappeared, scattering into particles of light.
For a moment, Esprit thought it was an afterimage, but she soon realized that it wasn't because the next moment, Peliod split into multiple bodies.
Even Esprit's 'Ultra Intuition' couldn't see them, and none of them were distinguishable from the real thing.

*This is impossible,* Esprit thought.

She was hoping that she could help Carrera even just a little, but it would be all she could do just to buy a little more time.
Phobio had also come in to help, but that was little more than a drop in the bucket.

*Well, honestly speaking, isn't this still better than nothing?*

This wasn't something that could be solved just by two people fighting together. Peliod's strength was exceptional.
And sure enough, Esprit and Phobio were attacked from all directions. It was all they could do to defend themselves from the onslaught of attacks, unable to tell which was the main body.
Esprit had quite the mercenary personality, so she never wasted time doing useless things. She wanted to reset this battle and give up on the fight.
However, dying was not an option.

*I guess I could still be revived even if I did die, but that would mean disobeying Rimuru-sama's orders. Carrera-sama would be furious, and I could never forgive myself either.*

Therefore, Esprit could not afford to die.
On the other hand, leaving the front line was not possible, so this was a dead end, to put it simply.
Because of such contradictory thinking, Esprit's movements slowed down. Not one to miss an opportunity, Peliod's poisonous fangs took aim at her target---

"Don't just stand there!"

Phobio kicked Esprit out of the way.
Immediately after that, the place where Esprit had been standing until just before was covered with poisonous scales released by Peliod. It was a poison that could kill even demons, despite its fantastically beautiful glow. Its toxicity, which could corrode the body and destroy the spirit, was so fierce that even Esprit, a demon peer count, would have been unable to withstand it.

"Ow, that hurts---thank you."

"Mm."

Phobio lightly responded to Esprit's honest thanks and resumed his attack on Peliod. He repeatedly swung a series of seemingly futile claw attacks, scattering the countless clones.
It was completely pointless as long as they couldn't tell real ones apart from the fakes. This, however, didn't dissuade Phobio from his brute-force approach.

"Hey, you're weaker than me, so why haven't you given up?" it slipped out of Esprit.
Since there had been no point in asking that question, she was not expecting an answer. However, Phobio laughed fearlessly.

"You're pretty rude," he declared. "Well, that's fine. If you survive, you can win. As Geld-san said, it doesn't matter as long as you can survive and win the next time."
In essence, now was the time for them to gather clues on how to carry on, that's why they had to persist, as Phobio said.

"Well, I'm weak," he added. "As much as I hate to say it, I just have to do what I can."

Esprit was satisfied with Phobio's surprisingly serious answer. And she agreed.

"I'm a competitive person myself, but you're pretty good too. I'll give you that, Black Leopard Fang Phobio."

"Thank you, Esprit-dono."

"You don't need to be so up-tight with me, you know?"

"I've made mistakes because of that before. Also, I don't think we have the time to be talking so leisurely."

Unlike Esprit, Phobio was serious. Even if he couldn't win, he did not turn away from the fight and launched more ferocious attacks on Peliod. With a jet-black wind, he had been slashing at multiple clones with his claws, but they had been ineffective.
But now, perhaps feeling annoyed by it, Peliod struck back for the first time.

The scales swirled and drilled their way towards Phobio. Even the smallest of scales could become a deadly weapon when they came together. If Phobio were to be hit directly, his body would surely be turned to ribbons.
He understood this better than anyone else.
The difference in strength between the two was obvious and facing Peliod like this would normally be suicide. However, he had come to the same conclusion as Esprit that Carrera's defeat would be certain if he did not do his best at this point.

*In that case, I have no choice but to do it, even if it is reckless. My life is worth a small price if I can divert attention even a little like this.*

Phobio was proud to be a Beastketeer.
Although he was tempted to run away, doing so would not only be an act of losing Karion's trust, but also a betrayal to his subordinates who believed in him. He could never allow such a betrayal, and it was that conviction that drove Phobio to do what he did.

Phobio's fighting style was characterized in his ability to use high mobility to taunt his enemies and kill them with sharp claws. Although his defense was not the highest, it was not so much of a problem due to his evasive maneuverability.
This time, he was barely surviving due to his speed. The slightest lapse in concentration could result in death, despite the fact that they were already walking on a very dangerous tightrope.

![break]

Esprit kept a keen eye on this.

*Hmmm, it was Gobua-san, Benimaru-sama's subordinate, wasn't it? I thought Phobio was just a weird guy who always talked about his love affairs with his girlfriend, but he really does show up when he has to. Unlike demons who can come back to life even if they die, he's a fragile being who can't come back after his death...*

From Esprit's point of view, even Phobio, who had become one of the most powerful individuals among the greater majin, was no more than a fragile being.

Esprit was a greater demon, the elite of the elite, and a follower of Carrera, one of the demon king pillars. Because death was not the end, but rather a resurrection like a continuation in a game, Esprit lacked a true sense of crisis. Depending on the damage she took, she could be put into a sleep of several hundred years, but for the demons who live for eternity, that was only a blink of an eye.
That is why Esprit was dazzled by those who lived their limited time to the fullest.

In contrast, what about herself?
Whenever she had a problem, her master Carrera took care of it, and then she could push the problem to her colleague Agera.
Up until now, Esprit had never felt desperation.

*Could it be that I am more useless than Phobio-san?*

No!
Something deep within Esprit's heart cried out that this was definitely not true. Perhaps it was Esprit's true feelings of hating to lose, something she had almost forgotten.
As if proof of this, Esprit, who had almost given up, strongly stood up once again.
This was no longer due to any lackluster reason, such as the fear of violating an order if she died. Now she wanted to win, and that desire shone clearly in her eyes.
Although:

"Frankly, it's impossible to beat her, isn't it? That's why, Phobio-san...let's trouble her as much as we can!"

Esprit was still a very pragmatic realist, so she didn't entertain any wild thoughts that she might win.
She calmly assessed the necessary conditions for a tactical victory.

"Huh, do you have a plan?" Phobio asked with a smile.

He sensed a change in Esprit's mood and realized that their chances of winning had shifted from zero to something more positive.

"You can't win with a head-on attack. That's why, even if it's a bit shady, do you think you could make a deal with a devil?" Esprit asked.
Even now, scales were grazing Phobio, and his body was covered with an ever-growing number of ultra-fine scars. It was only a matter of time before the poison would reach his body, which at that point would be the end of his life.
Despite the situation, he laughed.

"Another deal...but I don't have time to worry about that now, do I? All right. So, just what is this deal with the devil?"

Phobio still had the bitter memory of being deceived by Footman and the others through a previous deal. Nevertheless, he had already made up his mind and was prepared to take her up on her offer.

"It's a common one," Esprit replied casually. "Just tell me your wish, and in return, I will ask for your soul."

Because the demon race fed on human souls whether they were big or small, they were good at such contracts. They were well versed in all kinds of magic to meet the requirements of any kind of wish.
However, this was only true for the veteran demons who had survived from ancient times, not for newborn demons.
Needless to say, for Esprit, this was a simple little trick that she could do at her leisure.

"I understand. I believe in Esprit-dono, so I'll take you up on that deal."

Even though his right arm had been ground into a fine powder dust, Phobio agreed without even a groan of pain.
Upon hearing this, Esprit smiled.

"That's good, if you had hesitated about it even a little, I wouldn't have been able to make it in time."

That's right, Esprit had already been making preparations even before she heard Phobio's answer.

"And so, of course, my wish is---"

"The power to get through this!"

Esprit nodded her head and activated the demonic contract to grant Phobio's wish.
At that moment, the passage to Phobio's soul opened as payment, allowing Esprit to enter.
Esprit paused for a moment before leaving her physical body to cut off her hesitation. Then, she entered Phobio's soul in her natural form as a spiritual life form.
This was also the Intrinsic Skill 'Possession', a characteristic of the demon race. It was sometimes used to take over the body of a person with whom one had made a contract, and the purpose of its use this time was something similar to that.

<I really didn't want to use this method. I can't believe I had to leave the wonderful body that Rimuru-sama gave me on the battlefield like this.>

<What the, what the hell's going on here---?>

<Calm down. We're in the middle of a crisis right now, but we're prolonging the time more than a million times over with 'Thought Hyper-acceleration'.>

Esprit's calm voice gave Phobio some time to comprehend the situation. It was true that the world seemed to have frozen, as if time itself had stopped.

<...I see, so this is what the world looks like to those at the top.>

<As for me, I still have a long way to go. Carrera-sama is said to be about a hundred million times better, so even ritual magic that takes years to perform can be activated in an instant.>

<Haha, that's amazing...>

Rather than amazing, this was really just on a whole different level.
It was a world beyond Phobio's comprehension.
Ignoring Phobio's astonishment and dismay, Esprit began to explain.

<There is plenty of time, or rather time to spare, so listen to me. I have separated from my physical body and returned to my original spiritual existence to inhabit you. I would normally take over the host and use his power as my own, but there is a procedure to do that, and to tell you the truth, it wouldn't make me much stronger.>

Phobio excelled in physical combat, especially in close combat. His skill level had also been greatly improved by training with Midley.
On the other hand, Esprit had only just taken up swordsmanship as a hobby. Peliod specialized in magic, so she was able to use it against her to some extent, but she would soon be defeated. Therefore, she decided to let Phobio take the lead.
However, this did not mean that she would do nothing.

<I inhabited you so that we could concentrate our forces.>

<What do you mean?>

<You should continue to focus on your evasive maneuvers. As it was, you'd have been killed within ten---no, five minutes, but if we combine our powers--->

Esprit inhabited Phobio by means of a demon's contract. She then decided to surrender all of her power to him.

<...If I use that power, you think I can defeat him?>

Phobio's intuition whispered to him that it couldn't be that simple.
And he was right.

<She's not an opponent you can beat with just that. She seems to have more of a "vision" than I do.>

Peliod also had compound eyes that could read all kinds of information. It was because she was clearly aware of the flow of magicules that she was able to reflect any kind of magic.
This was obvious when she was able to throw back Carrera's 'Abyss Annihilation' in her first move. This fact proved that Peliod was more skilled in handling magic than Esprit.
Naturally, her 'Thought Acceleration' was also better than Esprit's.

<So then, what are we going to do?>

<You'll do everything you can to stay alive. Of course, you're not the only one. I'll help you, too.>

While Phobio took the initiative in melee combat, Esprit herself intended to fight with magic. The plan was to mitigate the attacks on Phobio with the assumption that this might not work either.

<I see. So the plan is to increase our odds of survival as much as possible.>

<That's right. The tactical victory here is to survive until someone comes along who can defeat her. And if we can get her attention and keep her out of Carrera-sama's way, then we have nothing to complain about.>

Phobio nodded his head in agreement.

<In other words, this is a way to buy time, right?>

<It's the only way. There's a clear difference in ability, so it can't be helped. But don't worry. According to my calculation, we should be able to last for 20 minutes.>

<Haha, that's very encouraging...>

*I don't feel assured at all,* Phobio couldn't help but laugh.

But he pushed forward.
As much as it hurt to admit, Phobio was weak. He had decided that the weak had their own way of fighting and that he would do his utmost to achieve that.
And so, the battle entered its second round.


![soft scene break]


Now, Phobio and Esprit were fighting as one, and because their existence values were also added together, it was increasing. However, their combined existence value was still less than one million, which was not much higher than that of Peliod.
Even so, thanks to the much improved performance, they were able to compete with her.
One of the reasons for this was that Phobio no longer cared about his physical injuries anymore since Esprit had started to shoulder the damage.
And he no longer cared about physical exhaustion either.

Phobio had decided to stop worrying about the various problems and had switched to a full-throttle combat style, giving up the long-term battle once and for all.
Of course, such an action would shorten the time limit of the active battle. Nevertheless, the reason such a strategy was successful was that Esprit was supplying magicules.

Phobio's 'beast form' had three stages.
The first was the normal majin form. This was the most balanced form and the least burdensome.
The second was the leopard-headed majin form. This form was versatile and specialized in fighting.
The third was the fully animalized form. It was the fastest in terms of speed alone. However, it was not suitable for combat against humans, as it could not handle most of the skills Phobio had been trained for.

Phobio was now in the most powerful leopard-headed majin form.
This form was not magicule-efficient, and exerting his full strength meant his body suffered damage. He had been fighting with a cautious approach, always controlling his power and releasing it at a moment's notice. Even if he was damaged, he was able to manage it because beastmen have a high regenerative ability. However, it was not good for a long-term battle because it consumed stamina and magicules to maintain such a high regenerative capacity.

But now, Phobio was able to put all these concerns aside and concentrate on fighting. His lost hand was regenerated, and he was able to use his full strength.
It was all thanks to Esprit.

![break]

Esprit protected Phobio by taking his soul into her mental body. This was made possible by Esprit's Unique Skill 'Discerner'. With this Skill, Esprit could form a connection beyond time and space with those whom she knew, and she could control the soul more perfectly by using this Skill together with the demonic contract.
As a result, Esprit would take a lot of damage, but that was about it. She showed off her demonic nature and endured it with all kinds of resistance.
However, painful things still hurt.

<Seriously, I hate insect types. For direct attacks on the mind, 'Pain Nullification' is meaningless.>

It was the accumulation of each of these factors that gave insectars their superiority over demons. Because the compatibility was so one-sided, an insectar would always win between two opponents of the same level of skill.
Combined with these unfavorable conditions, Esprit's damage was quickly accumulating.
Nevertheless, Phobio was still alive and well, and at the expense of Esprit, the battle remained competitive.
Besides, there was one piece of good news.

<I knew it. She was sticking around longer than I thought she would, but now I know why.>

<Hmm?>

<No, you don't have to listen to me.>

Muttering to herself, Esprit explained.

<As expected, she is specialized in magic and seems to have taken damage from Carrera-sama's magic. I thought there was no way she could repel such a huge magic without any risk.>

Carrera's 'Abyss Annihilation' had the power to destroy even a planet depending on how it was used. Because Peliod had faced the attack head on, Esprit thought that there must be some kind of anomaly.
She was not strong enough to prove it, but she was finally convinced of it once she inhabited Phobio and made full use of 'Discerner'.

<Then, if we aim at that weak part---can we win?>

<That's impossible. It's only because she's weak that she's not ready to attack, but her defenses are ironclad. Still, on the other hand, it's good for us too.>

Hearing Esprit's answer, Phobio was silent for a moment. Then he sighed heavily.

<As expected, I guess we'll just have to keep going until reinforcements arrive...>

It was a regrettable and undesirable conclusion, but it was the only one they could come to.
Phobio gave up and concentrated on Peliod to fulfill his role.

.........

......

...

And then, around forty minutes had passed.

<...We've worked hard, haven't we?> Phobio said.

<Too tired to talk. Can't do it anymore. I'm seriously gonna die.>

Even though he was wounded all over, Phobio was alive. Esprit, who was protecting his soul and taking the damage, was barely conscious. Considering that she had thought twenty minutes was the limit, Esprit was very satisfied with the result.
However, it was a result of exhausting everything she had.

Peliod, on the other hand, was in good shape. Her movement was even better than it was at the beginning of the battle, which meant that she was recovering from the damage inflicted by Carrera.
Strategically, this was a great victory, but tactically, this was a defeat.
But that was okay, because both Phobio and Esprit had done their part.

<Tch, I'm so upset, just when I got a girlfriend too.>

<What's that? Is that why you worked harder than expected? Well, I'll give you credit for exceeding my expectations, so as a reward, I'll pass on your message to her.>

Since they could no longer stand, all they could do now was wait for death. And so, they made light talk with each other.
Phobio wanted to enjoy the memories he had of Gobua, whom he had come to care for, but Esprit prevented him from doing so.

<You are the devil!>

<Yes. I am a demon, and so?>

<That's right. It's so sad that you don't get my sarcasm.>

<Well, even I'll feel troubled if you praise me so much.>

<I'm not praising you, okay?>

<Ah, yes. Well, I guess so.>

Through this intense battle, they had become friendly enough to engage in such banter.
And so, while drowning their fears of death and the humiliation of defeat, they impatiently waited for that moment.
However, then...

![break]

Without changing her expression, Peliod held out her hand. The magic-activating part of her body that was destroyed by Carrera's magic had been restored, so magicules could now be used more efficiently.
Phobio, who was lying on his side and unable to move, could be dealt with at any moment.
Peliod joyfully awaited Phobio's screams of death, not imagining that he and his comrade would be talking casually to each other to prolong the moment. Peliod did not feel any respect for the ones who had made things so difficult, and only pursued the pleasure that her instincts demanded.

![break]

Dense compressed magicule rays flashed from Peliod's fingertips, only to scour the ground, rather than penetrate Phobio.
A hobgoblin had leapt out of Phobio's shadow, grabbed Phobio's leg and thrown him down.

"Whoa! My appearance, wasn't it so perfectly timed?" a giddy voice echoed throughout the battlefield.
The owner of that voice, needless to say, was Gobta.
In order to break out of this critical situation, he had rushed to the scene as a reinforcement and appeared in full force.

![break]

Gobta was not the only one to arrive.
Gobua, a red-haired beauty in a scarlet military uniform, caught Phobio as he flew toward her. She held Phobio firmly to her chest and retreated to the back to protect him from Peliod's attack.

*Score,* is what Phobio thought to himself, but no one else would know.

And finally, Ranga, who appeared at the end, stood in the front to protect Gobta and intimidate Peliod who was trying to pursue him. He then launched an 'Apocalypse Howling^[Ranga first used this attack in the last volume against Vega.]' without hesitation and succeeded in slowing down Peliod's movement.
Thus, Phobio and the Esprit within him were saved from certain death.
Esprit, who had returned to the body she had left behind, stood up and spoke:

"Wow, as expected of Gobta-sama! I believed that you would definitely come to save me!"

Esprit, whose eyes were sparkling brightly, was actually a fan of Gobta.

"Eh, is that so? I'm a bit embarrassed."

"As one of the Four Heavenly Kings, please show me your cool side!!"

Esprit was flattering Gobta.
She was not trying to stir things up, but really meant it from the bottom of her heart.

"Well then," Gobta said, now getting his mojo back, "when this battle is over, let's go on a date..."

"Oh, I'm ready for that kind of thing!"

It wasn't a feeling of love or anything similar, so this was a point that should not be misunderstood.
Esprit then retreated from the front line with the rest, leaving Gobta with a drooping head.

Thus, the collapse of the front was prevented by the efforts of Phobio and Esprit.
After a change of players, the battle was brought to the third round.


![hard scene break]


A while after the outbreak of the Great War, several non-aggression zones had been formed on the battlefield. In these zones, battles between transcendent beings were taking place, and those who were not strong enough would be reduced to dust simply by approaching these zones.

![break]

Above the battlefield, the one-on-one battle between Frey, one of Milim's Four Heavenly Kings, and Insect General Torun, was becoming more intense than ever.

The Soaring Flock and Milim's Guards could only watch from a distance to avoid being caught up in the aerial battle between the two forces who were leaving even the speed of sound behind. The same was true for the flying insects under Torun, who were spreading out in wide disarray among their ranks.
Thus, it seemed that victory or defeat would be left to the final battle between the two forces in the battlefield in the sky, but this was evidently a mistake. Looking at the battlefield from a bird's eye view, only the forces of one side continued to decrease.

"Kishishishi, you're weak. You're quite good at running away!"

At first, Frey went on the offensive, but after her signature claw attack was evaded, she had been on the defensive.
No, she had actually attacked several times, but those were of no use to Torun, and she did not even feel like a threat to him. If she had to be honest, there was probably nothing that stood out to him about her other than her speed.
Of course, Torun was not the kind of guy who would let his guard down, which was the reason why the battle dragged on for this long...but he was beginning to think that it was time to end it.
That's why he had said what he did, but Frey only snickered in response.

"Oh, is that how you see it? In that case, I should be grateful."

"What?"

Torun tilted his head, not understanding the meaning. She should have been the one feeling cornered, but Frey's expression showed a definite smile of composure.

"Thank goodness you are an idiot."

"You what?"

"The most important factor in a battle, just what do you think it is?"

"Speed."

"Well, that is also correct. However---"

Certainly, Frey agreed that speed was the most important factor. At the same time, however, there was a more important factor that should not be forgotten.
It was not based on physical ability, but rather on intelligence. In other words, it was the way that one fought. When two fighters of the same level of ability clashed with each other, the outcome of the fight depended greatly on whether or not they thought about how to fight.

In this case, the current battle situation was proof.
As soon as her first attack was avoided, Frey knew that this fight would be a prolonged one. She decided that it was important to take away the enemy's strength without getting fatigued, so she adjusted her fighting style to one that sought optimum efficiency.
This tactic was not limited to herself but also included her subordinates.

In other words, Frey controlled the situation of the battle to her own advantage by involving the enemy forces in the aftermath of the battle between herself and Torun.
Frey's most notable point was her intelligence in using Torun's own power to drive the enemy forces to the brink of destruction.
This was Frey.
This was the true nature of the cunning Sky Queen.

Frey laughed, and Torun finally understood what was going on.

"Wha?! You, from the very beginning, were aiming for this..."

"Well, what do you think?"

"Impertinent... But you still can't get a scratch on me, so I'm the one who's gonna win!!"

Enraged, Torun accelerated and closed in on Frey.
However, this, too, was predicted by Frey.
Torun's aerial attacks were so troublesome that even a Demon Lord Seed class would be unable to see them, but Frey was a different story. By observing his way of fighting many times, she could see through the patterns and even calculate predicted attack points based on Torun's initial velocity.

It was dangerous to make assumptions in these situations due to the existence of powerful figures who ignored the laws of physics completely, but in the case of Torun, she had already confirmed that he was bound by the laws of the Cardinal World.
That is why she explained to him:

"Assumptions are dangerous. I'm quite timid, so it takes me a long time to be sure."

By the time Frey finished, Torun had reached the predicted position.
And what Torun noticed was the pain of fingernails piercing through his chest exoskeleton.
Torun's shiny metallic exoskeleton was not as strong as an alienium fist. If so, adamantite would be strong enough to pierce it...and the result was the current reality.

"...Huh?"

Torun was distraught, but it was already too late.
Despite his desperate attempts to resist, none of Torun's powers were activated. The moment Frey's claws got to him, the victor had already been decided.
And inside Torun's chest, which had been pierced through, there was the magic nucleus that was crucial for the insectar. Frey's claws were clutching it...

"So then, good-bye."

Torun's magic nucleus was brilliantly shattered.
And thus concluded Torun's death.

![break]

Lucia and Claire congratulated Frey.

"Thank you for your hard work, Frey-sama."

"Well done, Frey-sama. From here, we will conduct the full-scale sweeping operation of the site."

Frey nodded gracefully.

"Yes, please do. I'm really tired, but the battle is far from over. I don't think I should be resting either."

Frey looked around the battlefield.
In her line of sight, she could see her comrades struggling in the battle.


![hard scene break]


Frey had the upper hand from start to finish, but there were others who did not.
Although the disparity was not as great as that of Phobio's team, Gabil, who had come as a reinforcement, was showing desperate resistance while being tossed around by the enemy.
Gabil was by no means weak. He had acquired new strength and was also growing to be one of the strongest. However, his opponent was just too strong. Insect General Beathop was a formidable opponent who was too much for Gabil.

Gabil's existence value was 1.26 million, while Beathop's was over 1.7 million. While the difference in existence value was not a decisive difference in strength, Beathop's combat ability, such as his physical ability, was directly related to his existence value by a high percentage. He was an insectar who did not possess any special powers and instead specialized in close combat.
He was the worst match-up for the all-around versatile Gabil.
If Gabil had been alone, he would have been defeated long ago. The reason why this had not yet happened was that he had comrades fighting alongside him.

"Gabil-san, are you all right?"

"Mm. I'm still alive and well! Rest assured, Suphia-dono!"

Gabil and Suphia, who had fought together against Midley during the Eurazania invasion, were once again teaming up against Beathop.

Suphia was also the leader of the Winged Beast Knights, but she left that role to her subordinates. This time it had taken longer to leave because Phobio had given up the command first, but Suphia was not suitable for commanding, and she would always relieve herself of her duties after she finished raising everyone's morale.
Rather than leading, it was better to slaughter as many enemy generals as possible in order to make the most of one's individual strength.

She was well aware of this and did not hesitate to throw herself into the battle this time as well. However, Zelanus's forces were not so easy to defeat, and she was forced to give her all even though she should have had the advantage of two-on-one.

"Good, good! This is what a battle should be like," Beathop laughed loudly.

Beathop was drunk on his power. He enjoyed defeating the weak with his overwhelming strength, and for him, a battle was but a game where he steamrolled his opponents. In this respect, Gabil and Suphia, his current opponents, were just the right combination.

Taking them one at a time would have been unsatisfactory, and this situation of overturning a numerical disadvantage greatly excited Beathop. That's why he was enjoying the battle, even though he could have settled it much earlier.
Such impure intentions were easily conveyed.
Gabil and Suphia were desperately trying to find a way to win and lamenting their lack of ability.

"I have faced many strong opponents over time, but you seem to be the strongest of them all."

"Oh, I see. I'm flattered to hear that, but I'm not going to take it easy on you!"

Beathop's voice sounded really happy.
In contrast, Gabil and Suphia spoke in displeasure.

"Hmph! How ridiculous! You say that when you haven't even been serious until now."

"Ah, that's right. If you're a warrior, be a warrior. Don't play with your enemies!"

Beathop did not intend to cut corners, but he certainly wanted to prolong the fun. Gabil and Suphia saw through that and were offended.
However, it was thanks to that, that they were still safe, which was more frustrating than anything else. It was humiliating to be saved by an enemy's pride.

Indignantly, Gabil took a recovery potion.
Similarly, Suphia chugged the expensive full potion without hesitation.
Despite this, the countless wounds on their bodies showed no sign of recovery. The reason was simple;^[The author needed an excuse to ignore his overpowered healing items.] their existence values had exceeded the prescribed amount of the recovery potion.
Suphia had also evolved under the influence of Karion's awakening, and now her existence value was enhanced to just under 500,000. Although she was not as strong as Gabil, there was a clear distinction between her and greater majin or Holy Knight class human beings, so even a potion that would completely heal a normal person would not be enough to do so for her.

The principle of full potions was to activate cells by means of magicules, and even to compensate for missing parts, thereby restoring cells to their original state. However, for majins with a high intracellular magicule density like Gabil and the others, one or two restorative potions would not be enough to replenish their cells. That is why the two had used over a hundred recovery medicines during this battle. For minor injuries, simply sprinkling the potion on their bodies was effective, so the two of them were already completely soaked with potion.

"It's a good thing that the taste has been improved. Though I'd like to refrain from taking any more recovery medicine for the time being."

"I agree. At first, I thought the strawberry flavor was cool, but now I'm just hungry."

Because Suphia was more dependent on the recovery medicine than Gabil, she appeared to be quite fed up with it.
However, she was still lucky to be safe.
This was all thanks to the special training with Midley.
For the past several months, the two had been learning the art of close combat against Midley. If it had not been for the Battlewill defensive shield, which they had become proficient at, they would have died without even the use of recovery medicine.
But now, that good fortune was about to come to an end as the atmosphere around Beathop changed.

![break]

"Hey, now, is Torun dead?"

The reason Beathop had been ignoring Gabil and the others who were exchanging pleasantries was because he had noticed that one of his comrades had been defeated by Frey.
On a stalemated battlefield, it was dangerous for one side to break off. Knowing this, Beathop decided that it was no longer the time to play around.

"It can't be helped," Beathop declared. "I wanted to take it easy, but I'm going to make a move."

It wasn't that he had been playing around, it was just that Gabil and the others had been doing better than expected. Even so, this was an equilibrium that had been established because Beathop had been keeping the pace of the battle in mind.
Similar to Karion's strategy, Beathop, who did not want to go all out at this point, fought in such a way that he could leave some energy left over. Now, however, with the defeat of his comrades, he had shifted into a mode of destruction without thinking about the future.

"*Kill*" Leaving that mutter behind, Beathop disappeared.

Taking advantage of his leg strength, he immediately closed the distance with the force of an Instantmove and kicked Suphia.
Suphia, of course, did not follow Beathop with her eyes, but rather with 'Magic Perception'. She had broken away from her old style of fighting with only her natural ability and had polished her skill-levels.
But even so...

Beathop's moves were too fast.
It was only to be expected because this time he attacked with his full power, not caring about the damage to his own body.

"Gah?!"

Suphia barely managed to protect herself with both arms, but the result was cruel. Her crossed arms were shattered, and she was hit with a powerful kick to the abdomen.

"Suphia-dono?!" Gabil shouted as Beathop paused in his kicking position. He quickly glanced at Suphia while preparing himself.
She was barely alive.

*Hmm... Just one kick did that to her...*

As a result, Suphia's withdrawal from the battle was inevitable.
Rather than despair, Gabil thought it was fortuitous that he was not dead. But thinking that way was naïve when you got right down to it.
Gabil was a warrior, and he did not make a habit of unnecessarily hurting his defeated opponents. Moreover, it went against Gabil's aesthetics to deliberately finish off a fighter after the victory was assured.

Of course, Gabil also understood that there were those who believed killing the enemy on the battlefield was the right thing to do. Still, he did not expect that anyone would make an unnecessary pursuit in the face of a strong enemy. In other words, he had assumed that Beathop was also a skilled fighter and would not take any actions that would give Gabil an opening.
However, reality was often cruel.
Beathop turned his back on Gabil and swung his raised leg toward Suphia.

"Gack."

There was a dull gurgling sound, and Suphia coughed up blood.
Beathop's foot had crushed Suphia's heart. At this rate, she would surely die. Thinking for a second, Gabil understood exactly what was happening.

*How foolish. He would rather leave himself wide open just to finish off an opponent... No, he must have confidence in his ability to endure.*

That understanding was nothing short of humiliation, but perhaps it was not wrong. With the difference in competence between Gabil and Beathop, that outcome seemed highly probable, Gabil thought to himself.

Though his heart was shaken up, his thoughts remained calm.
Should he bet everything on the hand he was given and aim for victory, or should he...

*There is no need to hesitate. Rimuru-sama would also praise my choice!*

It only took a moment to make up his mind.
It was a gamble whether the plan would really work or not, but Gabil believed in his power without hesitation.

"Don't let Suphia-dono die!!"

With that shout, he threw his precious Vortex Spear, something he considered like a part of his body, at Beathop. And then, just as Beathop was avoiding it, he rushed over to Suphia.

Then, Gabil unleashed his power.
Even he was not sure if this power could affect others, but right now, there was no other way to help Suphia but to rely on it.

"Turn back, fate! Hear my wish and create a miracle!" Gabil prayed. He believed with all his heart that Suphia would come back to life, and that he could help her with his power.
As a result, the 'Change Destiny' of the Ultimate Gift 'Psychology King Mood Maker' could be activated only once a day, rewriting the tragedy that should have come...

![break]

Beathop cast a questioning glance at Gabil, who appeared to be exposed and defenseless even in the middle of a battle. He immediately concluded that Gabil must have given up the fight the moment he let go of his spear.

"Idiot," Beathop sneered.
"Together as comrades, I will get rid of you cleanly."

Beathop showed no mercy even to those who had lost their will to fight. It was Beathop's belief that mercy led to carelessness. However, because low-level insectars did not have emotions, Beathop was a superior individual in that he understood the concept of affection, though it would not be a comfort for the adversary.

And so, a gust of wind blew across the battlefield.
Beathop unleashed his power once again and sent a spindle kick towards Gabil.
The alienium covering his leg blade gave off a dull glow, and Gabil's fate seemed to be at an end.
But that future would not come.
Fate had been altered, and Suphia had been fully restored.

"Watch out, Gabil-san!"

As soon as she was resurrected, Suphia took evasive action, following her instincts of danger. As if caught up in the action, Gabil rolled away on the spot.
Beathop's kick destroyed much of the ground, but Gabil and Suphia were able to escape from the crisis safely.

"Phew, I was saved," Gabil said.

"That should be my line. I thought I was dead, but Gabil-san saved my life."

"Mm. It was a risky move, but I'm glad it was a success!"

Perhaps feeling relieved to have escaped from the crisis, the two exchanged a few light words. But Beathop was still alive and well, and the real battle was yet to come.

"...? I thought for sure I killed her, but how is she still alive?"

"I would love to explain it myself, but I won't tell you!"

"Well, that's fine. I'll make sure I get you next time."

Beathop broke off the conversation and tried to put all his strength into his body once again, but Gabil interrupted him with a laugh.

"That's impossible," he spoke confidently. "I just realized this, but your power cannot be used continuously, can it? Otherwise, there would be no reason for you to waste your time talking with us."

Beathop's speed exceeded Apito's, and the power of his fists and kicks was as heavy as Geld's. Moreover, his irregular movements, such as suddenly accelerating and then stopping, were so exquisite that even Apito could not have imitated them. Those movements were very difficult to recognize and were almost impossible to avoid. That is why, on the contrary, Gabil wondered about them.

*Even Apito-dono said that it was easy to accelerate but difficult to stop suddenly. Hinata-dono used magic to twist the laws of inertia to make her mysterious movements possible, but there is no sign of this person using magic. In that case, the only thing I can think of is...*

It was either the control of the law via special ability, or by brute force.
With these two options in mind, Gabil continued his observation and noticed that Beathop was using 'Ultraspeed Regeneration' on his body after each attack. In other words, Beathop was demonstrating combat ability that surpassed his limits through forceful brute strength.

If so, there was only one way to deal with it.
If Beathop kept on attacking with such unreasonable force, he would eventually self-destruct. All Gabil had to do was concentrate on defense and wait for that moment.

However, these were also attacks from a superior opponent who had surpassed their limits. He would be killed instantly by a single blow if he was not careful, and he would continually be walking on a tightrope that was much too dangerous.

Beathop's Limit Break attack, which required much sacrifice, was several times faster than Apito and could kill Gabil with a single blow depending on where it hit. A limb was sure to be damaged, and even taking a scratch would be a big deal.

Thinking that it would be difficult to continue to deal with such attacks, Gabil asked Beathop to reconsider his tactics. Even without the Limit Break attack, Beathop was still superior. Gabil hoped that if he showed that he had been exposed, Beathop might be able to return to the conventional strategy.

"..."

There was an awkward silence.
It was broken by Beathop's loud laughter.

"Gyahahahaha! Great, that's great! Really, you're weak, but I can't get enough of you!" After laughing like that, Beathop's mood changed once again.
"I acknowledge you. That's why, I'll take you seriously!"

The bet had failed.

"What?!"

Gabil thought it was a bad idea.
He had made such a big show of pretending to be the better guy, and now he couldn't back out.
Gabil had Suphia behind him, so running away was out of the question.
Now, he had no choice but to leave it to luck and do his best to survive the situation.

*At least, if I had my Vortex Spear in hand...*

The lizardmen's secret treasure, the spear, had just been tossed away. He wanted to go pick it up, but he did not think Beathop would allow him to do so.

Gabil was resolved to the situation.
In that moment when all his nerves sharpened in anticipation---

"Gabil-sama, you lost something!" Sukerou's^[In case you forgot, this is one of the three lizardman posse.] voice rang out, as he returned the Vortex Spear to Gabil's hand.

"This guy has been fighting alongside us all this time, right? Don't let go of him again," Sukerou said, in a stylish manner.

"Indeed." Kakushin nodded.

"Right, right! With that, Gabil-sama is the strongest, so hurry and get rid of that guy!" Yashichi made a reckless request as usual.

Even the Vortex Spear in his hand was trembling as he nodded in return.

"You guys..."

Hot tears welled up in Gabil's eyes.

*Nn? Huh? Why does the spear seem to be pulsating to a beat...*

He was about to realize something very important.

"Gabil-sama, we believe in you."

"Indeed!"

"Gabil-sama, you're gonna show us your cool side, right?"

The expectations from the three of them were heavy.
It was more like a shove than a cheer...

In particular, Yashichi was especially terrifying. Both unknowingly and innocently, he was pushing Gabil into a corner.
Gabil, no longer thinking about the spear, stood up proudly and puffed out his chest as usual.

But then, something unusual happened.
He was cheered on by Suphia as well.

"Well, I agree. Gabil-san, those guys are right. You know, you look just as cool as Karion-sama in my opinion."

That was a bombshell of a statement for Gabil.

![break]

Eh, I'm cool?


![full page image](image2.jpg){Gabil asking Suphia out during battle: Can love bloom on the battlefield? I'll ship it. Go team suphil/gaphia!}


Suphia's voice was echoing in Gabil's head.
He couldn't think about anything else.
Even Beathop, the powerful enemy and threat right in front of him, had slipped out of Gabil's mind.
Because, well, it couldn't be helped.
Gabil had never been popular with the ladies.

Behind his back, he was seen with a certain amount of favorable attention, but at the end of the day, Gabil was a luck-pusher^[The word used here is "ochōshimono (お調子者)" which doesn't have a clear English translation. It basically means someone who pushes his luck, can be frivolous, readily chimes in with others, easily flattered, and can easily get carried away. Lol, petition to add this word to the English dictionary pls.]. There was no way that he could recognize the subtleties of a woman's heart, so there was never a chance for a good mood to develop. Thus, he continued to renew his "no girlfriend" record until now.

And then came Suphia's comment calling him "cool."
This moment in Gabil's life was the most important decision he had ever made.

*I have no choice but to say it! If I miss this moment, I will never be able to get a girlfriend for the rest of my life.*

Gabil summoned up his courage.
It is said that facing death stimulates the instinct to procreate, and this must have been exactly the case with Gabil.

"Uh, I mean...that is to say. I-I too, have been thinking that Suphia-dono is, uh, b-beautiful..."

At a time when he should have been mourning in despair, on this battlefield that was so out of place, he made a confession to Suphia. He really did it.
It was charming how his courage dried up in an instant, and his voice became more and more whispered. The fact that he was unable to say his confession until the very end was also typical of Gabil.
However...

To Gabil's surprise, his pitiful remarks were conveyed to Suphia.

"Eh?! A-are you serious...you think I'm cute?"

He had said "beautiful", not "cute."
Suphia was also flustered by this extreme situation. As evidence, her way of speech had changed to something more feminine^[I changed the translation a bit to make more sense in English. Actually, it says that Suphia's tone of voice changed from "ore" to "atashi." Both of them mean "I" in English to refer to oneself. The only difference is that "ore" is more bold/masculine, and "atashi" is more feminine (though still in a tomboyish way---yeah, this would never come through in English). There are many different "I" pronouns used in the Japanese language, but essentially, Suphia became flustered and started speaking more ladylike than usual (she went from speaking like a boy, to speaking like a tomboy).].
In a way, they were a perfect match for each other.

"Um, you are correct!"

Gabil, he was correct not to deny it here.
If he had done so, his destiny would have turned out differently. However, by choosing the correct answer, the goddess of fortune had turned her favor upon Gabil.

"Well, uh, i-it can't be helped then, Gabil-san... So now, if you defeat him and finish this battle safely, I'll reward you with a smack on the cheek^[The pun is between 誅する/chuusuru (kill in the name of justice) and チューする/chuusuru (kiss).] as a reward!"

Suphia, in her fluster, did not even understand what she was saying. She was swept away by the situation and had made a ridiculous declaration without even realizing it.
However, Gabil was different.
He had firmly carved Suphia's words in his heart.

*Eh, "a smack on the cheek"? Not in the sense of "give you a slap" but "to kiss"---is that what she meant?!*

It was an unprecedented situation.
Gabil's brain was running at full capacity and he was panicking.
Behind him, the usual Yashichi, Kakushin, and Sukerou trio were supporting him with cheers.

"Gabil-sama, you are so popular!"

"Hoo!! This is a surprise. I knew you were a man of action, but confessing your feelings on the battlefield is just so bold!"

"Indeed! That is what it means to be a man!!"

<Let's go Ga-bil! Let's go, Ga-bil! Let's go!!>

As always, once the Gabil marching song came flying out, there was no stopping it.
Gabil abandoned all thoughts, and his body began dancing on its own accord.
Because this had been repeated so many times, it had become a conditioned reflex.
And so, he became fully immersed in a delusion of careless happiness.

*Mufufu! I finally have a girlfriend. Heh, it's difficult being so popular!!*

It was a bit too presumptuous, but since it was Gabil's own delusion, no one would ever find out.

![break]

One person who could not stand Gabil was Beathop.
At first, he thought it was all a trap, but the three who came to the scene showed no sign of helping.
That was convenient in its own way. Beathop's forceful movements had increased his fighting ability beyond his usual capabilities, so he didn't really have time to spare.
Of course, 'Ultraspeed Regeneration' would heal his injuries quickly, but the problem was that he was still consuming a lot of energy. He had thought that he could recover his strength and finish them off all at once.
That was the reason why he had allowed Gabil and the others to continue their farce.

And now, he was in perfect physical condition.
Beathop resumed his ferocious onslaught on Gabil. Or rather, he was going to finish him off with a single blow.

*Ignoring me like this, you're just spouting a bunch of nonsense. Fine. I'll show you what I'm made of!*

In such a rage, Beathop unleashed a deadly spindle kick at Gabil.

But then... Something amazing happened.

"Hey, stop getting in my way!! This is the most important moment of my life right now!!"

Gabil shouted and struck Beathop with his spear. And just like that, Beathop was unceremoniously blown away.
It was an unbelievable event. All of Beathop's compound eyes opened in astonishment as he shouted. "You, what did you do?!"

But Gabil was not listening.

"S-Suphia-dono, by 'smack' you mean *that*, right?"

Upon being questioned, Suphia understood what she had said.
She was embarrassed, but she couldn't just take it back now.

"O-oh. That, you mean that thing."

She said that as if telling herself it wasn't a big deal.
Gabil nodded repeatedly.

"I understand! I, for one, pledge to win with all my might!!"

Gabil was inspired. Any sense of hopelessness was long gone.
It was no longer a question of whether he could win, he *would* win. With this spirit, he glared at Beathop.

"Don't make a fool of me, small fry."

Beathop was indignant at Gabil's attitude.
He thought Gabil had a big mouth for how much lower rank he was compared to him. At the same time, however, he had not forgotten the strange phenomenon that had just occurred. Although he thought it was just a coincidence, he remained vigilant just in case.

*Was it really a coincidence? I've attacked with the intent to kill many times. I wasn't holding back, and I felt like it had worked. So then, why is this guy still alive?*

Beathop's instincts told him that this was no coincidence. This was more dangerous than he thought, so Beathop braced himself. Gabil, on the other hand, was just excited that he might be able to get a girlfriend.
They had completely different mindsets.
One might feel sorry for Beathop in this situation, but this world was always absurd.

"All right, here I come!" Gabil shouted with a fierce look on his face.

Beathop silently greeted him.
And then, in the next moment...

![break]

The two men faced each other once again.
Far from taking things easy, Beathop twisted his whole body like a cone in a super-speed flight with a power that exceeded his full strength. All of his power was concentrated into the poisoned needle of alienium protruding from the tips of both fists. This was Beathop's special move, the Spindle Needle Spear.

Gabil, on the other hand, was holding up his Vortex Spear, true to the basics. He did not panic, did not make a fuss, and took his time to assess Beathop and then delivered a killing blow.
Two large whirlpools of power swelled and collided on the battlefield.
And as a result, it was Beathop who fell.

"Vortex Crash!!" Gabil's special move pierced through Beathop.

"Amazing!"

"Gabil-sama, so cool!"

"Mm, brilliant!!"

It was only natural that the three of them were surprised and lauded him with praise.
Gabil's offensive was so overwhelming that it made one wonder if the previous struggles had been for nothing.
Beathop had not been careless nor complacent, and yet, this was the result.
The secret lay in the Vortex Spear.

Gabil had been so occupied with his confession to Suphia that he did not realize that the Vortex Spear had evolved into a mythical-grade weapon during the critical situation. And, of course, Gabil was primarily recognized.
As a result, Gabil's existence value exceeded that of Beathop's in total. Because the two sides were almost equally matched in terms of skill, Gabil was able to take the victory.

<Ga-bil! Let's go, Ga-bil! Let's go!!>

Gabil danced to the song of victory, cheered on by the trio.
Suphia was also smiling as she watched, but then she suddenly remembered the promise she had just made and blushed.
Gabil also blushed when he noticed Suphia's behavior, and the two stiffened as they looked at each other.

"It seems that we're intruding."

"Indeed."

"Good luck, Gabil-sama!"

With those words, the trio left in haste.
Gabil and Suphia were not happy to be left behind, but surprisingly, the two of them were a perfect match...

It did not take them long to be honest with each other, thanks to the suspension bridge effect on the battlefield^[Just to clarify. The suspension bridge effect is a term used to describe when people make a mistake in assuming what is causing them to feel arousal/attraction. It's a misattribution of those feelings. The general meaning is that the heightened emotions of the battlefield played a part in Gabil/Suphia's feelings for each other.].
Thus, spring came to Gabil.


![soft scene break]


And so, the death of Insect General Torun had triggered a drastic change in the battlefield, but it was not just Gabil's group.
Karion, Midley, and Obera had also been watching the situation, fearing that the balance of power on the battlefield would be upset. In that moment, they made a decisive decision.

![break]

Karion was the first to make a move.

"Heh, Frey won. Well, of course, I can't lose either."

He smiled wryly and glared at Abart.

Abart, who had many limbs^[Just a reminder. Abart is kind of like a spider hybrid with spider-like limbs covering his back -shudders-], was not only good at close combat but also at magical combat.
His stretchable slender arms, covered with the exoskeleton that reached the peak of alienium, could pierce his enemies sharper than a spear. Not only that, but by using his free hands to make a sign, he could also perform magic without chanting spells.

At first glance, this combination of magic and unique physical techniques appeared to put Karion in a difficult situation.
However, the reality was different.
Karion was just waiting for an opportunity.

It was a matter of finding a way to preserve the Beast Roar, his special move, and defeat the enemy with less energy consumption. While thinking about this, Karion was searching for Abart's weak points.
As soon as the battle began, Karion realized that he had the advantage. However, that did not mean he was taking it easy.
Abart's strength was genuine, and if he was not careful, Karion could be defeated. Moreover, because he had a feeling that it would be dangerous, he did not want to bring about unnecessary injuries by rushing things.

In fact, this was the correct choice. Abart was a special individual who entered a rampant state whenever his physical strength was almost exhausted, tripling his attack and recovery power. If that had happened, Karion would have had a hard time and, or worse, would have suffered a defeat.
However, Karion was able to maintain the battle line without any danger because of his wild intuition. He also recognized Abart's habit.

Karion, who knew how long it would take for the magic to be used again and how long it would take for the spear to be fully extended before it was returned to its original position, waited for Abart to simultaneously activate both of them. Finally, the moment had arrived.
Frey's defeat of Insect General Torun had triggered Abart's impatience.

"I've been waiting for this. Beast Roar!!"

Karion's technique pierced Abart's body. The flash emitted by the magic particles widened the area of effect and completely engulfed Abart.

![break]

Midley gazed down on the battlefield quite calmly.
Insect General Saril, standing in front of him, was of no concern.
Midley had perfect control of his body, always exerting only a certain amount of power. In some cases, he would even adjust his body to the same level as that of his opponent, enjoying the act of fighting more purely. In this respect alone, Midley was in the same league as Diablo.
That is exactly what Midley had done with Saril this time as well.

"Hm hmm... You approach this naively. You seem confident in your poison, but it won't work against me. If your attacking style of relying on your poisonous tail doesn't work, then what will you do?" he taunted Saril as if to provoke him.

"Damn it, how cocky!"

Saril lost his temper at Midley's taunt. However, the increased power from his fury was meaningless if he couldn't hit his target. Saril, whose actions had become monotonous, was now at Midley's mercy.
While it would have been easy just to finish him off, Midley refrained from doing so because he was aware of the eerie atmosphere that covered the battlefield.

*What is this persistent feeling? Hmm, probing my power. Ho, so they've lost interest. In other words, they can kill me at any time...*

This presence reminded him of Milim, whom Midley worshiped. However, unlike Milim, there was no warmth in it at all. It was cold and devoid of any emotion...an eerie presence.
Midley had intentionally kept Saril alive in order to find out their his identity.

*Hm, As expected of Obera-dono. She has noticed this presence as well as I have.*

Obera, too, was looking around the battlefield without defeating the Insect General who was facing her. Since the difference in power was such that she could defeat her opponent immediately, it seemed safe to assume that she was aiming for the same thing as Midley.
The others did not seem to notice.

Not to mention Carrera who was dealing with the enemy general Zess. She was engaged in a fierce battle with no room for others to intervene, and it appeared that she did not have time to worry about unnecessary matters.

The same went for Geld.
The Insect General with the appearance of an anthropomorphic giant centipede, was second only to Peliod in terms of presence, and seemed to be almost equal to Geld. It was no wonder that he could not afford to worry about other things, and Midley did not want to cause unnecessary concern.

Gobta and Ranga, who were facing Peliod, were probably much too much concerned with the superiority of the enemy in front of them. However, Midley was truly thankful that this duo had come to their side. Midley was thinking that he would have to rescue Phobio and Esprit because they would have lost their lives otherwise. However, the eerie presence in the battlefield worried him and he couldn't make a move.

Midley thought of returning the favor to Gobta by offering to help him with his training later, even though it would seem like an unnecessary favor from Gobta's point of view.

![break]

And so, after a prolonged stalemate, the situation finally changed.
Starting with Frey defeating Insect General Torun, Gabil took out Beathop, and Karion took out Abart.

Midley sensed that the ominous presence filling the battlefield had become more intense and dangerous. For reasons unknown, something bad was happening. He was convinced of this and braced himself.
His colleagues, Karion and Frey also appeared to have finally sensed the ominous presence after defeating the Insect Generals they were dealing with. He guessed that they had instinctively been aware of it but were now sure of it.

*Those two still have a way to go. Their fighting styles have improved, but it will be difficult for them to keep up with Milim-sama unless they learn to pay more attention to their surroundings.*

This was a rather harsh evaluation, but it was Midley's true feeling.

"Kekeke. How dare you make a fool of me. This is a last resort move, but whatever."

Saril went berserk towards Midley who appeared to have no interest in him. He stuck his poisonous tail into his own body and activated 'Overdrive' of his own volition.

"Hmm..."

Against Saril, whose strength and speed had increased several times, even Midley could no longer afford to play around with him. With a foreboding feeling in his heart, he decided to end the battle.
Midley, who had become serious, was strong.
He restricted the oncoming Saril with his massive fighting aura, stopping his movements. He then delivered a killing blow to his helpless foe, and Saril's body was crushed to dust.
It was an instant kill.
He showed off a dazzling performance as a man strong enough to be Milim's playmate.
However, Midley's expression was dark.

"I don't like it. As I thought, the chills are getting stronger."

Midley muttered to himself and looked up at the sky which had begun darkening before he knew it.
The chills running down his spine were telling him that killing Saril had been a mistake.


![hard scene break]


As Midley surmised, Obera also had a sense of urgency.

*This doesn't make sense. The pressure from the enemy has not changed at all since the beginning of the war...*

Obera was treating Tishorn, who could slice through anything by vibrating the alienium exoskeletons on both of her^[I'm not 100 percent sure if Tishorn is a male or female, but in the Japanese raw, she seems to speak in a feminine manner which is why I'm using female pronouns in the meantime. Tishorn is the Insect General that looks like a mantis.] arms, like a child. She did not finish off Tishorn because she was having the same concerns as Midley.

Many lives had been lost on the battlefield.
The damage to her allies had been minimized by the use of restorative medicine, and the injured were quickly switched with their replacements, so there were no casualties. However, the insectar army had been continuing the onslaught without regard to the loss of life, and they had already been reduced to less than half of their initial strength.
Despite this, the enemy's strength that Obera sensed with her hyper-intuition' was still intact and undiminished.

The moment that Frey defeated Torun was the moment that this feeling of discomfort became a certainty.
Even though one of the enemy generals had been defeated, nothing had changed. This meant that even the death of the Insect General had no effect on the insectar army---no, or perhaps it could be worse than that.
In the worst case, it was even possible that the Insect Generals' deaths themselves were one of the enemy's schemes...

*It can't be. As expected, that's just...*

It wasn't impossible, she couldn't say for sure that it wasn't true.
A colleague of hers, Zalario, had once complained to her about them. "They are really persistent," he had said. "They can be a nuisance even if you beat them, so you have to choose the right place."

At that time, she thought it was a rare occurrence for the normally taciturn Zalario, and she only felt that he seemed to be tired, but now she realized that the meaning of his comment was very significant.
Back then, she had already decided that it was not her job to deal with the insectars, so she had no intention to consult with him from the beginning and had not listened to what he had to say.
This wasn't just Obera's problem, but also a bad habit of the phantoms as a whole, led by Feldway, but Obera still regretted that they should have informed each other of the major problems at least.

![break]

All that said, it was a bit too late for that.
Since she knew nothing about the enemy, she had no choice but to be flexible and seek the most appropriate response according to the situation. With that in mind, Obera continued to observe the battlefield while dealing with Tishorn.

Then, the battle situation changed quickly without any decisive moves being made.
Torun, followed by Beathop and Abart, were defeated. Even though so many enemy generals fell, the enemy's strength did not decrease even slightly. With such a result, there was no room to doubt that this was a part of the enemy's strategy.

*It's dangerous. We should not take down any more Insect Generals.*

Although they were enemies that must be defeated, safety was the priority. If something unforeseen was happening, they had to remove the cause of anxiety without being hasty.
Obera tried to issue a warning, but it was a little too late. By that time, even Midley had already taken care of Saril.

Only four Insect Generals remained. Tishorn, whom Obera was facing, Mujika, whom Geld was holding off, Peliod, whom Gobta and Ranga were struggling with, and finally, Zess, who was fighting with Carrera in another dimension of combat. Half of them had already been defeated.

Obera's blank expression turned dark for a moment, as if something bad was about to happen. Tishorn did not miss it and smiled.

"Hohoho, so you've noticed it. After all, the lowly Insect Generals are just the opening act. With His Grace's^[She refers to this person as "Okata-sama" which is kind of like saying "your honor/excellency/majesty" or even just "honorable person." This person can be a master, a King or Queen, or etc.] great power, whether I am present or absent, will not affect the big picture."

As it was, Tishorn was a high-ranking Insect General. She was the fourth most powerful. Tishorn's existence value is a little over 1.8 million, which was not that much different from Beathop's. Still, the fact that she had been part of the upper echelon of the Insect Generals for so long was proof of her power.

"Dimensional Slash."

The shockwaves emitted from Tishorn's arms became slicing extensions that slashed and tore at everything in all directions. The effect of the shockwave extended to the dimensional realm, and although the dimensional slash was instantly restored by the world's healing power, it was impossible for the materials on the surface of the slash to withstand it.

Naturally, even Obera was no exception.
Obera could see through it at a glance and did not make the mistake of suffering such an attack, however, she still recognized that Tishorn was a threat.
Partly because of that, Obera was acting in a way that would minimize the damage, but at this stage, she was not sure if it would be a good thing or a bad thing.

"Dimensional Slash."

Tishorn released another move, and a vicious shockwave came flying in.
While avoiding it with a comfortable margin, Obera was gradually becoming impatient.

"Like a foolish one-trick pony, you keep repeating attacks that don't work."

"Hohoho, that is an interesting point you make. It's up to me, not you, to decide whether it works or not."

Tishorn's reply was plausible. No one was a fool to believe the words of their enemy. If she thought it would not work, she would have stopped it long ago. Tishorn was repeating the same attack because she believed it would work.
And that was precisely why Obera did not like it. That is why she tried to stop Tishorn by inciting her to think it was useless. When that failed, Obera reconsidered Tishorn.

*You really are experienced in fighting, taking the optimal action without any hesitation. Simply winning would be easy, but neutralizing her without killing her is tough even for me...*

Obera had already seen through Tishorn's ability. The gap between her and Tishorn was vast, and she could say without a doubt that Tishorn was inferior to her. However, this was only true if she had not been injured in the battle with Michael.
Obera's wounds were all healed, and it was true that she was in good physical condition. However, her lost energy had yet to be completely replenished, and the situation was far from perfect. Otherwise, she would have neutralized Tishorn long ago. The failure to do so was the reason for her current situation.
Even so, there was no time left for hesitation.

"Your Honor, please shine your light upon us!!" Tishorn shouted, and at the same time, her combat ability greatly increased. Like Insect General Saril, she had voluntarily triggered Overdrive.

However, there was one thing that was different from Saril.
Tishorn had full control over Overdrive and could effectively utilize the time limit.

"Dimensional Slash, Final Dance."

It was an attack incomparable to anything that had come before.
A spectacular scene unfolded, with more than 10,000 dimensional slashes occurring, making it impossible for any human being to escape from this space of death and destruction.
In contrast, Obera took action---she did not run away from the scene, and simply stood tall.

No, that wasn't it.
Obera had given up on neutralizing Tishorn and decided to go all out.

"Divinity release," said Obera lightly.

That was Obera's signal to go all out.
The mythical-grade equipment she had been wearing regained their starry radiance. The circulation of Obera's magicules had restored their full performance.
And in Obera's hand, was a huge double-edged sword. That was the Beast Slayer; it was the result of Obera's beloved longsword transforming into its true form.

Against the cryptids, Obera's nemeses, she had abandoned the idea of taking things easy. If she had been lenient, the damage would have continued to increase without stopping. She had always tried her best to eliminate cryptids with optimum efficiency. Therefore, once Obera decided to fight, there was no choice but to annihilate her enemies without any regard to the damages in the surroundings.
And now, her true power, which exceeded 20 million in existence value, was about to be demonstrated.

"Hohoho, it's too late to get serious now!"

As Tishorn said, Obera was already trapped in the space of death. Since Tishorn's interference prevented her from escaping through 'Spatial Transportation', there was no way for her to avoid being sliced to pieces.
That's how it should have been.
But the result was:

"This attack is nothing more than child's play."

It was true that a direct dimensional slash caused the space to rip open. And yet, just as the space returned to its original form, Obera's body was also restored to its original state.

"I-it can't be?!"

"My body is connected not only to the material world but also to the spiritual world. This is nothing," Obera explained indifferently, increasing her magicules as if to say that it was now her turn.

The Beast Slayer began to shine.
Upon seeing that dangerous light, Tishorn was bewildered by emotions that had arisen for the first time in her life.

*My body is trembling. It can't be, it can't be that I'm afraid, right? Does this mean I'm frightened?!*

She understood as such, but it was too late. There was nothing Tishorn could do.

"O vanishing one, may you scatter beautifully! 'Planetes Bombardment'!!"

A massive slash indiscriminately rained down from the heavens, delivering a merciless yet fair death. Tishorn, who was caught in the blast, vanished into dust, unable even to show the dignity of a powerful opponent.


![hard scene break]


Geld was struggling.
The enemy he faced was Insect General Mujika.
Mujika^[I'm guessing that Mujika is male based on some descriptions, but I'm not positive and could be wrong. He also refers to himself using "Sessha" which is how old Samurai used to talk. He was also described as an anthropomorphic centipede.] was a warrior-type insectar, clad in a garishly colored shell of a warrior's armor, who wielded a sword with both hands.

Mujika's strength was equal to that of Geld's.
Both sides refused to give an inch.
And their subordinates were also going at it back and forth.

The Yellow Numbers and Orange Numbers, who maintained an ironclad line of defense, were holding back a swarm of giant centipedes who were led by Mujika and were more than 30 meters in length. Because of the difference in size, teams had been formed to deal with each centipede.

Whenever they were injured, they would heal themselves with restorative medicine, and whenever they got tired, they would switch out with those in the rear to maintain the front line while avoiding overworking themselves. This was all the result of their regular training.
Therefore, the battle remained in a stalemate even after several hours had passed, though the most notable matter was the one-on-one battle between Geld and Mujika.

Mujika wielded a long sword with skill that could put a first-rate martial artist to shame, and judging by his high level of skill, it was hard to believe that he had developed this technique all on his own.
He could have been a reincarnated person from the other world, but that was not important. What was certain was that Mujika was a formidable opponent.

Geld caught the sword with his large shield. This shield was also a gem that had become a part of Geld and reached the mythical-grade level. It was akin to Geld's own flesh and blood and had been transformed to have properties similar to that of the exoskeleton of an insectar. Therefore, any minor damage could be repaired instantly.

The air shook and the impact was enough to even scatter plasma, but Geld kept a cool facade. In return, Geld swung at Mujika with his Meat Cleaver.
However, Mujika was also a great fighter, and he anticipated his attack and parried it with his sword. Not only that, but countless legs popped out from the gaps in his armor and unleashed a barrage of blows as if to pierce through Geld.

The action taken by Geld, who appeared to be on the verge of a crisis, was to respond with a 'Demon Lord Haki' counterattack.
Geld's haki along with 'Corrosion' effect of the Ultimate Gift 'Gourmet King Beelzebub', 'Chaos Eater', bit at Mujika's legs with erratic movements, as if it had a will of its own.
His legs would not be defeated either, and they were cloaked with an evil youki to cancel out Geld's 'Chaos Eater'.

These clashes were repeated, and the situation remained inconclusive.
However, such a battle suddenly came to an abrupt end.

"Hmph. Even Tishorn is dead. How surprising. I didn't think the fighting force of this place would be this strong, but now His Grace's preparations are complete."

"Hm?"

"Well, it's of no matter to you. It's been a long time since I've met a warrior who can challenge me so well. I would have liked to compete with you more, but it's almost time."

Mujika said so nonchalantly and distanced himself from Geld. Then, he took the remaining insectars and showed his readiness to retreat.

![break]

Even after seeing this, Geld did not let his guard down.
But then, Geld also noticed something.

*Something is strange about the atmosphere of the battlefield. Could this intense fear be an omen of something to come...?*

It was such an overwhelming sense of danger that he wondered why he had not noticed it before.
Geld looked up at the sky. Dark clouds were swirling around, and he had a feeling that something was about to manifest.

"All hands, maintain full alert!!"

At Geld's command, even those who were undergoing treatment began to move.
His unusually ominous demeanor made it clear to everyone that the battle was not over.


![hard scene break]


As soon as Phobio was rescued, Gobua scrambled to rebuild the front line.
Under Benimaru's guidance, Gobua had developed into a first-rate commander. Through the large-scale combat training in the labyrinth, she was able to train in all kinds of gruesome tactics and was therefore far more experienced than any tactician.
The three hundred Kurenai members under Gobua's charge were also veterans who had grown up together with him. They did not need to be ordered by him to take the best course of action.
Although they were only few in number, the war situation had been greatly improved.

Furthermore, the presence or absence of a commander alone could affect a war situation. With Phobio back in the front line and in command, the Winged Beast Knights regained their vigor.
In this way, Milim's forces gradually gained the upper hand, but...

![break]

In the midst of such an upswing, Gobta was dying.
Peliod, whom he was facing, was an unbelievably dangerous opponent.
Her poisonous mist was so deadly that it could even kill Gobta, who had a high level of resistance to poison. It was not merely something that could kill if consumed, but something that would melt the skin and burn the flesh at the slightest touch.
The slightest contact with the skin caused extreme pain. Thanks to this, Gobta realized the danger of the poisonous mist.
And then:

*Wait a min...that's dangerous! Dead, if this keeps up, I'll be dead for sure!!*

That's what he decided less than 30 seconds after the battle started.
And so, without hesitation, he asked Ranga, who had rushed over for support, and decided to use the secret technique.

"Magic Wolf Unification!!"

Without a moment's delay after entering the battle, he assimilated with Ranga.
Thus, Gobta and Ranga were transformed into a sinister two-horned humanoid black wolf. It was the correct course of action. If the decision had been made even a little later, Gobta would have been killed in the battle, let alone Ranga.

"Now then, let's do this!"

<Gobta, you may let loose with all my power.>

At first, the two were excited, but that enthusiasm soon faded away.
The reason was simple: Peliod was too strong.
The assimilation of Gobta and Ranga did not mean that their combat ability increased that much. The combination of Ranga's latent abilities and Gobta's sense of combat would only make them more powerful than the sum of their abilities. In other words, since Gobta's existence value was not that high, it was almost as if there was no change in the situation in terms of numbers.

Peliod, on the other hand, was a frightening presence from their point of view. Her existence value was 6.8 million, more than 15 times larger than that of the assimilated Gobta and Ranga, and it was the second largest after Zess. Not only that, but she was also an extraordinary user of space-type abilities and could even reflect Carrera's 'Abyss Annihilation'. Even with their secret technique, she was a far superior existence.

The reason why they had not been defeated immediately was that Gobta and the others were good at physical close combat, while Peliod was better at magical mid-range and long-range combat.
Therefore, from the beginning of the battle until now, Gobta had been in a tense situation where there was no room to relax. They were able to keep the battle reasonably close, thanks to the fact that they could just barely maintain their advantageous position.
But even that was about to come to an end as Peliod's condition changed.

<Gobta, have you noticed?>

<This is bad, Ranga-san. Somehow, isn't she getting more and more powerful?>

Gobta and Ranga were concerned about Peliod's current condition as they were facing her. Compared to the beginning of the battle, there was a sense that her fighting ability had increased. As evidence of that, she was steadily responding to the duo's movements more and more. Their feints were no longer working, and they were losing time on the offensive. Peliod's vicious jabs were beginning to reach Gobta's side, though not to the extent that they were completely on the defensive.
Peliod had changed from previously launching monotonous attacks, to imbuing the intent to kill in each attack.

<To grow in the middle of battle, it's a foul play, don't you think?>

<It happens often. I have experienced it myself, so I shouldn't be surprised if my enemies do the same...>

<Well, that's true, but it feels unfair when I'm the one being attacked...>

The two of them were complaining to each other about such things, but they were determined to brace themselves for the situation.
Gobta understood.
They were the reinforcements, so no further help should be expected.
Rimuru, whom Gobta respected and who was always there for him no matter what, was also fighting on another battlefield. This time, the enemy was so powerful that they could not expect any help.
If anything, there was a possibility that Benimaru might come. However, Gobta would prefer that didn't happen, since it would put their home country at risk.
In other words:

<Well, we have no choice but to do something ourselves.>

<I agree. If the enemy is strong, we just need to become even stronger than them!>

So, in the end, they went with their guts.
As a commander, that was no good, but for Gobta, it gave him a reason to push himself.
As the phrase "fighting the last stand^[The phrase used here is "haisuinojin (背水の陣)" which is a Japanese idiomatic expression that doesn't come through in English. It literally translates to something like "Backwater Formation" but the closest English description I could give for it is "fighting the last stand." "背水の陣" basically means a last-stand moment, fighting a last-ditch battle, having burnt one's bridges/boats, or fighting with your back against the wall.]" suggested, for Gobta, who always maintained the mindset to retreat, this situation in which he could not run away helped him to push himself harder.

"From here on out, I'm going for a quick and decisive battle!" With that enthusiasm, he accelerated his attack.

However, it all ended up in vain.
They even tried launching a two-stage attack to win the battle, taunting Peliod with 'Dance With Wolves' and at the same time unleashing the special attack, 'Apocalypse Howling'. However, even that was evaded.

*Seriously?! That one was secretly trained, a special technique!!*

This made Gobta feel a sense of danger.
The same was true for Ranga.

<Gobta, shouldn't we step back for now?> he proposed, but Gobta opposed it.

<That's no good. If we leave now, Carrera-san will have to bear too much of a burden.>

Ranga agreed with him.
Since reinforcements were not to be expected, one of the options was to run away to regroup, but that was a last resort. Since this was not a duel but a war, fleeing before the enemy would have too great an impact on the whole situation.

However, as long as their secret technique wasn't working, there would be nothing left but an inevitable defeat. Gobta, who hated to lose as much as anyone else, wanted to avoid such a situation.
Even so, he could not come up with any good ideas...and then it happened.

"I'll help you out, Gobta."

Karion, who had defeated Insect General Abart, joined the battle upon seeing that Gobta was at a disadvantage.
And that was not all.

"I'll help you too."

Even Frey, who saw the danger of Peliod, rushed to the scene and offered to fight with Gobta.
It is not a fair fight, but this was a war, not a one-on-one battle. Victory had to take precedence over honor, and Gobta welcomed the offers.

"I'm saved!!" he exclaimed happily, and with this, the battle was renewed.

![break]

...Or so everyone thought.

![break]

"How sad. So, so sad. My children, they are so weak."

The monster's murmurs, though not loud, reached the ears of all the people on the battlefield.
Everyone present understood that this was the signal for the final round.


![hard scene break]


Carrera was fighting an evenly matched battle against Zess, the leader of the Insect Generals.
Although Zess was a formidable opponent, he was by no means an opponent that Carrera could not defeat. He was a good opponent, and she was enjoying this battle.
Carrera showed off her recently acquired technique.
Golden Gun and sword, the same fighting style as Lieutenant Kondou, was a style that suited Carrera well. Her movements were so natural and effortless that one could be convinced that Carrera had been an expert for a long time.
In addition, Carrera was accustomed to fighting against insectars. This was the reason why she was not even a step behind what normally would have been a disadvantageous match-up.

Yes, Zess was very similar to someone Carrera knew well. From his back to the exoskeleton that covered his entire body. Although their fighting methods were quite different, the quality of his techniques, and the presence of a superior opponent who overpowers others, was just like that of Zegion's whom Carrera had recognized as her rival.

Indeed, Zess had a tremendous presence. It easily surpassed Carrera's existence value and was almost three times that of Zegion's. However, Carrera felt that Zegion was superior in terms of threat level.
She had fought against Zegion many times. It's why Carrera was able to outperform Zess's approach even if she had never met him before. Moreover, there were no longer any restrictions being imposed on her.
Zegion's "don't target any parts made of Rimuru's cells" limitation, the weird rule that Diablo had come up with, did not apply to Zess. This was why Carrera was able to give it her all.

![break]

At the start of the battle, Peliod had been a nuisance. However, Esprit and her team did everything in their power to get rid of her. They were trying their best against a superior opponent.

*Well, my friends are putting in a lot of effort, so I can't show them my bad side!*

Carrera was enjoying the deadly battle with Zess, as if letting go of her boiling emotions.
The blade, aiming at a gap in the shell, sliced through Zess's body tissue. In addition, close-range bullets pierced through Zess's compound eyes between dance-like sword blows.
The battle was gradually tilting in Carrera's favor.

"Hahaha, how fun!"

"Tsk, the devil herself is an impudent brat..."

"You're pretty strong, but not as strong as Zegion."

"What?"

"Zegion is my acknowledged rival, but my battles with him have been nothing like this. I've fought him for several days straight, and I've never been able to inflict a single wound on him."

It was true.
Even when considering the weird restrictions, Zegion's strength was extraordinary.
Zess was indeed powerful, but Carrera's attacks had hit him several times. Carrera was convinced that she would definitely win as the battle continued.

"What now?"

"In other words, you are the weaker one."

"Ridiculous. In that case, I'll show you what it means to get serious."

Carrera's remarks were enough to hurt Zess's pride.
Converting his anger into energy, Zess turned his killing intent on Carrera. Anyone below A rank could be killed by his gaze alone. No, even for a greater majin, there was a violent pressure that could have been fatal if handled poorly.

However, Carrera shrugged nonchalantly. In return, Carrera herself increased her mana, refined her haki, and hurled it at Zess.
The two opponents' heavy auras pressed against each other, and a huge vortex was formed on the battlefield. Any who touched the vortex was engulfed by the tremendous mana wave, and their lives were taken away.

Milim's side had anticipated this danger, so no one approached Carrera. However, the insectars, who had filled the battlefield in great numbers, were greatly reduced in number by the vortex.

And then, Zess took a step forward, and Carrera intercepted him. Zess's fist ripped into Carrera's cheek, and Carrera's sword sliced through a gap in Zess's exoskeleton. Zess delivered a kick that could slaughter even a greater majin with a single blow. Unafraid of this, Carrera dove into Zess's range and fired her Golden Gun.
The bullet from close range pierced through a gap in Zess's exoskeleton, opening a hole. However, immediately after that, Zess's kick swung down towards Carrera's head as if falling out of the sky.

"Che?!"

Carrera barely managed to save her head, but it was not enough, and she was kicked in the shoulder.

"A fail to kill."

"It's shameful to have made a mistake."

Carrera's left shoulder was shattered, but she still had a wry smile on her face. She regretted having been injured when she had initially intended to defeat Zess with no damage, but she did not think that Zess would defeat her. After several hours of battle, Carrera had seen through Zess's habits. Nevertheless, Zess's power was genuine, and Carrera could be defeated if she was not careful. She had to accumulate damage little by little to ensure victory.

Carrera stared down at Zess with an imposing expression. Her uniform was torn at the shoulder, revealing pure white skin.
That's right. The blood had already stopped flowing, and she was completely healed as if she had never been injured in the first place.
The same was true for Zess, whose wounds inflicted by Carrera had all healed.
For transcendent beings like Carrera and Zess, non-fatal damage was meaningless. The decisive factor was in how efficiently they could exhaust their opponents, and the opponent who showed the larger opening was at a disadvantage.

Carrera's first move had been big (Abyss Annihilation), and her total energy was less than that of Zess. Therefore, she was planning to be very careful from this point on.

*Fufufu. I understand Zess's skill-level. He is strong, but I'm the one who will win.*

Carrera decided that there was no need to overdo things anymore.
It was all because she was sure of her victory, but then she suddenly noticed that the atmosphere of the battlefield had changed.

*Nn? This feeling...what is it? Milim-sama was on alert, so I left things to her, but...*

Milim-sama's presence had allowed Carrera to run wild as much as she liked. That's why she hadn't noticed it until later.

No, that wasn't all.
The main reason was that Zess was so powerful that she did not have enough time to pay attention to her surroundings. And furthermore, it was a situation that Zess had intended to cause.

"Kukuku, so you've noticed. You are strong. I will admit that, but we're the ones who will win. This is not a duel, but a war."

"What?"

Carrera raised her eyebrows in displeasure.
Zess, unconcerned, raised his right hand and pointed in a certain direction.

"Look."

Carrera did not turn around to look, but probed the situation using 'Magic Perception'.
And then, she understood the meaning of Zess's words.


![hard scene break]


Right before Gobta's eyes, Peliod had been beautifully transformed.
Although she had always had an unusually beautiful appearance, Peliod had now changed into the kind of mysterious beauty that anyone could appreciate.
No, it was not just a change---it was an evolution.
Peliod's scars, which had been accumulated during the battle, were torn wide open, and a lovely woman with beautiful "skin" had emerged from underneath.

"A pleasure to meet you, I am Peliod. The queen^[The word "Kōhi (皇妃)" can also translate to empress.] who rules over the insects."

Even her speech had become fluent.
It was obvious that she was no longer the same person they had been fighting, and that she had become a supernatural being.
It stood to reason.
This Peliod was the viceroy of the Insectars and indeed the queen who ruled over the Insect Generals.
Now that she had revealed herself, Gobta's chances of victory were as good as lost.

"Please don't joke around, seriously..." Gobta unintentionally muttered his true feelings.

<This is no longer a matter of increased strength. It's not the time to talk about being stronger than them.> Ranga nodded his head widely in agreement.

<So, what should we do?>

When Gobta asked that question, Ranga hesitated. He then spoke up, as if he had made up his mind.

<We have no choice but to run away. Gobta, you feel she is dangerous, don't you?>

Gobta was stumped by the bluntness of the statement.

<No, well I agree...but to run away by ourselves, I'm not sure it's a good idea...>

Gobta thought that Ranga's opinion was correct. If it was the Peliod they had been fighting earlier, they might have had a chance to win depending on the way they fought. But now, there was no chance at all. So much so that the current Peliod's presence was overwhelming. She had called herself the queen, and she far surpassed the power of all the Insect Generals. Yes, she was even superior to Zess, the head of the Insect Generals who Carrera was dealing with.

Ranga and Gobta had sensed it accurately. Even if they fought, they would inevitably lose. However, they did not want to be the only ones to escape. If they ran away, they would never be able to face their friends.
Continuing was hell, but escaping was also hell. However, there was no time to worry about that here.

"Shut up! You may look different, but what you do is the same." Yelling that out, Karion was the first one to make a move.

Karion chose the Beast Roar, his best special technique. Uncaring of what would happen next, he unleashed his versatile diffuse-focused particle cannon without hesitation.
Karion's body transformed into will-containing particles and approached Peliod, who stood tall.
It was a split second. Peliod did not move.
But it wasn't that she couldn't move...

"Wha---it can't be..."

She didn't even need to move.
Peliod's breath turned into a poisonous mist, clinging to Karion who had turned into particles. The mist then took away his kinetic energy, rendering him unable to move.
However, Frey did not anticipate Karion's defeat at this point. She took flight during Karion's attack as a distraction and landed behind Peliod.
And then Frey made her move.

"I'm going to have to seal your movements," Frey declared just after she had captured Peliod with her 'Garuda Claw'.

Frey's 'Magic Interference' was now so effective that it had taken on a divine nature to the ultimate realm. It was so powerful that it could block Adalmann's 'Necronomicon'. This 'Garuda Claw' that she relied on could seal any opponent's ability, no matter whose it was.

No, rather that's what it was supposed to do.
Even though she should have been in a tight spot, Peliod smiled.
And then, she spoke:

"How sad. My children were defeated by such an opponent."

"I beg your pardon?" Frey asked, but was silenced shortly thereafter by a powerful blow to the abdomen.

"Guu, guhaa?!"

Despite coughing blood with a startled expression, Frey followed her instincts and removed herself from Peliod.
That saved Frey's life.
If she had continued believing in the 'Garuda Claw' and remained in the same position, she would have been killed by Peliod's next blow.

"I see, you have good intuition. That claw made me a little weak, but I could have killed you with two blows. But it makes sense now. Putting power aside, you have a lot of experience in combat. In that case, my children's honor can be restored a little," Peliod said as if singing.

"I can't believe it... You were able to nullify my claws so easily. So you were such an unbelievable monster."

Frey was now convinced as well. Like Gobta and Ranga, this would be a place to die. The same was true for Karion, who was lying on the ground.
Karion was so exhausted that he couldn't even make a sound, and he was unable to even try and fight back. In this situation, even running away wasn't an option.

*Tsk, not to copy Frey's words, but I never expected her to be such a monster...*

He regretted not seeing through this at the start of the battle.

*Well, even if I had, what would it matter?*

Karion mocked himself.
Come to think of it, they should have been more cautious the moment Peliod had reflected Carrera's 'Abyss Annihilation' back at them.
It was the fault of everyone who believed that she was a simple mid to long-range magic type.

*Even so, I can't believe Milim didn't notice it either, so why isn't she making a move? No, I see... Insect Lord Zelanus is a much more dangerous opponent...*

A chill ran down Karion's spine.
And then he remembered it was a battle against Milim.
The was only one reason why Milim, who was such an absolute existence, would not make a move even in this crisis. It was clearly due to Insect Lord Zelanus, meaning that they could not expect any help from Milim.

*So that's it, shit! Then, this war...*

It would be a disservice to his comrades to even think beyond that point. Karion thought as such and began to think about what he could still do to help.


![soft scene break]


Frey was seriously injured, though not as badly as Karion.
Such a Frey crossed eyes with Peliod.
She was prepared to die.
Since Peliod was the absolute being of this area, no one could stop her. If that was the case, Peliod would finish off the weakest one first. Because Frey would definitely do that if she was in her shoes.

*I'm sorry, Karion. I was hoping to get to know you more, but...it seems this is as far as I go.*

Frey made up her mind and prepared herself to get in at least one more final blow.
But then, a man stood in front of Frey.
This man, Midley, confronted Peliod to protect Frey.

"Hoho, so that's how it is. The purpose of this special 'Barrier' that has been spread around the battlefield is to collect the energy of your dead comrades to you."

"It's not just to collect. I, for one, need more power to give birth to stronger children," Peliod answered with a smile, turning to Midley.
That was enough of an answer for him and he was determined to get rid of Peliod at this point.

*If we let her go, she is sure to create many more monsters like the Insect Generals we have just defeated. The problem is that we are the ones who want to escape.*

Despite his bitter smile, Midley's eyes remained hopeful.

"If so, then try defeating me first!" Declaring that, Midley took a deepened stance.

Shifting his center of gravity to his right foot, he lightly moved his left foot forward. At the same time, he clenched his right fist and squeezes it at the waist, holding his left hand out in front of him as a check against Peliod.
And in the next moment, he exploded his power starting from the tiptoe of his left foot, using his own body as a cannonball and rushing forward. Then, he thrust his fist with all his strength and released a mass of fighting aura in the shape of a fist.

"Draconic Cannon!!"

The energy of the earth was integrated with his own fighting aura, and it coursed through his whole body from his toes, converging into a fist. Then he unleashed this special move---'Draconic Cannon'. It was a full-throttle attack with no restraint, and even the energy of the earth was combined with it. A divine blow that was powerful enough to be used against superior opponents.
This was the true essence of Midley, the greater chaos spirit dragon majin.

Unfortunately, it did not work on Peliod.

"That's an interesting technique. If I learn this, my children will become stronger."

With a laugh, she easily deployed a space-manipulating magic circle to eliminate the Draconic Cannon.
But this was just as Midley expected.
In fact, Midley did not expect this would work from the very beginning, and his role was to be a decoy. And, of course, it was Gobta who struck the real blow.

"Don't forget about me! Eat this too!!"

Gobta jumped out of Midley's shadow and launched an 'Apocalypse Howling' at the right moment.
But that didn't work either.
Peliod was unfazed and deployed another magic circle at the same time to eliminate the 'Apocalypse Howling' as well.
It was a complete surprise attack using Midley as a decoy, but it did not reach Peliod. However, there was still a glimmer of hope in the faces of Midley and Gobta. There was another true contender who had finally made her move.
It was none other than Obera.

"You're overconfident, little bug!"

While Peliod's attention was drawn to Midley and Gobta, Obera was preparing a deadly attack. She unleashed her second 'Planetes Bombardment' of the day. Unlike Midley and Karion, Obera's existence value was comparable to that of Peliod's. Therefore, the attack could not have left Peliod unscathed no matter how she was---no, that was wrong.

"Zalario was also a wise person, so I knew you would be too."

"What?!"

"It can't be..."

"No way, I didn't expect it to this extent."

Everything was in the palm of Peliod's hand.
And there was no time for despair.

"I will pay you back." Peliod said to them with a smile.

The meaning of this announcement was revealed by a shower of meteorites falling from the heavens. Peliod had diverted the power of Midley and the others' three special techniques and spread them over the battlefield.
It was a devilish act.
It was an act of tyranny that would take the lives of both friend and foe alike.

"Tsk!!" Midley glared up at the sky in panic.

<Everybody, brace for impact!!> Gobta, being Gobta, alerted his friends of the danger via 'Telepathy Net'.

Obera calmly slashed at Peliod. She intended to kill Peliod in close combat, since she was unable to use magic or emission techniques.
Peliod frowned at this. As a matter of fact, there was not much of a difference between Obera and Peliod in their overall combat abilities. Peliod's 'Spatial Domination' gave her the absolute advantage over mid to long-range fighters, but she was not particularly good at close combat, as evidenced by her inability to kill Esprit and the others.

The plan had been to gain a psychological advantage over Obera and overwhelm her. Yet, Obera was not discouraged at having her special attack broken.
Obera was also a fierce fighter who had experienced fighting against cryptids. Having suffered from troublesome opponents with various characteristics, she was not fazed by a few things.
Although Obera's attitude was a miscalculation, Peliod's advantage remained the same. By sprinkling death across the battlefield, all that energy would become Peliod's strength.

*But isn't this strange? I was able to collect the power of my children, but not the others...*

With this question in mind, Peliod looked around the battlefield and then realized that she had made a second miscalculation.
The enemy forces, that is, Milim's army, were protected by Geld and his men.

"Don't give up. As long as we're here, no one will be killed!!" Geld's strong and reliable voice echoed across the battlefield.

"Right!!"

The legionnaires led by Geld were also pushing themselves to meet their commander's expectations. Even if their shields were shattered and their armor was lost, their sturdy bodies were filled with strength, and they protected the others from the falling meteorite showers.


![full page image](image3.jpg){Geld in a hail storm: Geld used protect, it's super effective!}


That wasn't all.
The demons under Carrera's command were also active in that moment.
Restoration magic was flying across the battlefield, healing wounded soldiers. Moreover---

"Hey, hey, you've still got a lot more work to do!"

With that lighthearted remark, one of the devil chevaliers wielded god's miracle: Resurrection. By believing in Rimuru, they had even learned to resurrect the dead. Even if their bodies were shattered, their souls would be retrieved by the demon and resurrected at a later date.
The morale of Milim's army remained high because even the dead could come back to life, albeit with a time limit. Everyone was facing this challenge head-on in order to accomplish the mission with all their might.
Upon realizing this, Peliod was upset for the first time.

"The dead are coming back to life? There even exists such a secret technique in this world..."

Obera shrugged her shoulders and explained to Peliod, who cried out in surprise.

"Yes, I believe so. It was supposed to be forbidden, but it was so widespread that it became irreversible."

In fact, Obera had been astonished when she found out about it. She was told about this in the strategy meeting and couldn't help but want to look up and shout "It can't be!" to the heavens.
But that's another story.

Since this secret technique had already spread so widely that it couldn't be reversed, it would be more constructive to make effective use of it. Obera decided that it would be the right thing to accept it, since it would reduce the death count on the battlefield to as close to zero as possible.
Therefore, Obera had predicted this situation to some extent. She did not expect that their own techniques would be repelled, but the damage was only done to the enemy's bugs. It was a pity that the energy was concentrated in Peliod, but considering that Peliod was the only enemy left, the situation did not seem that bad.

"Now then, prepare yourself. From here on out, it's a one-sided hunt."

Hunting down and killing her prey was one of Obera's specialties. Still mindful of the fact that she was leading a group battle against a superior opponent, Obera's face was even beginning to show a relaxed smile.

"What are your orders, Strategist-dono?"

Midley was also relieved that the damage to the battlefield was minimal. He had not expected such a scale of destruction, but he was happy to see that Geld and his team had averted the disaster. With his worries of the future now gone, he gladly joined Obera's command.

"I have no objections!" Gobta was also on board.

Against a powerful opponent like Peliod, they had no chance to win unless they worked together. It was difficult to get along with others on a spur-of-the-moment basis without any training, so they decided to obediently place themselves under Obera's command.
Thus, Obera, Midley, and Gobta & Ranga were pitted against Peliod. But then, another intruder appeared.

"Mother. Allow me the honor of crushing your enemies!"

Mujika, who left Geld behind, had dug his way through the ground and jumped out.
The tally was now three-on-two, but this number was subject to change.

"Don't forget about me either."

"Me too. I hope you didn't think that was the end of it."

Karion and Frey, healed by Geld, were back on their feet, though still wounded. Their wounds were visibly healed, but they had not regained their lost strength. They could not perform any major moves while they were out of energy, but they were determined to do their best to fight, which was better than doing nothing at all.

"I'm here too." Geld was also in high spirits.

It was now six against two.
Gobua and the Beastketeers were on the battlefield, dealing with the rest of the insectars. Either way, Peliod was not a force they could reckon with, so it seemed safe to assume that those who had gathered here were the total force.
Even before the assembled warriors, Peliod smiled bewitchingly.

"What a wonderful package. That's right. I will use you all to create more powerful children."

It was a confident statement in the face of Obera and the others.
And it was on the basis of:

"Life Reconstruction."

Peliod was able to use her accumulated energy to strengthen the children she had created.
Of course, this was only applicable to those who were still alive. However, Zess and Mujika were both still alive and well on this battlefield.
Here and now, accompanied by two superior warriors as her escorts, the queen---the wife of Insect Lord Zelanus---had revealed her true nature.


![hard scene break]


Carrera, who understood the situation after Zess pointed it out to her, had a bitter expression on her face. She had been enjoying her fight with Zess, but now she felt disillusioned because of the curtain that had been pulled away.
Immediately after that, she felt a chill and jumped back as fast as he could. A moment later, the place where she just stood exploded.

"Hm, that's great. Thanks to Mother, I am one step closer to becoming the god of creation. I'll need you to help me test this power."

Zess, speaking more fluently than before, opened and closed his fist as he addressed Carrera. These were the words of the strong said to the weak, a statement that trampled on Carrera's pride.

"Well, huh...so you say. You're asking me to join you in a test of strength?"

"You have no right to refuse." As soon as he said this, Zess lightly thrust out his fist.

It was a gentle jab---or rather, the speed of the jab was tens of times faster than the speed of sound. The shockwave was so strong that it burned the air and shattered the ground.
Clearly, it was more powerful than before.
The existence value of Zess appeared to have increased significantly, if not doubled. What was more troubling was that various special abilities seemed to have been newly added to Zess' being.

*How unfair, seriously*...Carrera grumbled inwardly.
After all these efforts to build a path to victory, she had to start all over again. However, although it would be difficult, it was not impossible. Because his level itself did not seem to change, although his power had increased.

If Zess had shown the same level of skill as Zegion, Carrera would have felt threatened. However, since this was not the case, Carrera did not lose her composure even though she was frustrated. That said, she was still annoyed at Zess's arrogant attitude, and she was determined to get back at Zess.
The reason why Carrera's smile disappeared from her face was not because she was in despair of Zess's power. The real problem was the situation with her comrades.

*This person looks pretty dangerous. She seems to be stronger than my prey (Zess), and I doubt that Obera and Midley-san can win even if they work together...*

Carrera's estimation was that Gobta and Ranga, Geld, Karion, and Frey would have to fight all out to defeat Mujika. The enhanced Mujika had become a formidable opponent.
If the battle turned out as Carrera had predicted, the odds of winning were 50-50.

*Sacrifices would be made, going against Milord's will.*

Carrera was faithful to Rimuru's orders.
The reason why she was dealing with Zess in this way was because she had thought that by taking charge of the most troublesome enemy, she could avoid casualties to her other comrades.
This was based on the assumption that Milim would take care of Zelanus, the enemy general, because she assumed that if she took care of the second most important enemy, the rest would be taken care of. Since she was wrong, she could no longer afford to be bothered with Zess, who was only the third greatest threat. Carrera had a big decision to make.

*I wanted to save this just in case, but I don't want to regret not using it. Sorry Zess, I would have liked to enjoy fighting with you more, but it looks like it's time to say goodbye.*

Carrera made a heartfelt apology to Zess.
Carrera had wanted to defeat Zess and gain experience, but when her friends' lives were at stake, she could not allow herself to put her own enjoyment first. She made up her mind and pointed the Golden Gun at Zess.

"Huh, don't you understand yet that such a thing will not work?"

As Zess said, even Carrera's magicule bullets condensed by the Golden Gun could only damage Zess's exoskeleton. Moreover, since the wound was regenerated immediately, the damage was practically zero. Nevertheless, Carrera continued to use the Golden Gun as a distraction. And there was a reason for that.
It was something important...

"Then, die."

...It was to use it as a trump card in a critical moment.

Before Carrera's words could reach him, the Golden Gun released a deadly bullet.
The name of that bullet which could destroy anything was called 'Judgment'.

"Ha?"

Zess looked dumbfounded at the gaping hole in his chest.
It came late, the sensation of his life fading away. The magic nucleus that sustained his existence was destroyed, and he understood that there was no way to escape his impending death.

"You...you were holding back from the beginning...?"

"No, we were about even in strength, and you're quite strong now. If we had gone head-to-head, it would have been difficult to win."

"...Then, why...?"

"It's because of just that."

It was fun to continue fighting a battle that may or may not be won, but it was no longer the time for Carrera's personal feelings to take precedence. The more Carrera struggled, the higher the probability that her comrades would be wiped out.
In addition to that, there was another main reason.

"The battle with you was interesting in its own way, but you are weaker than Zegion, so I think I've had enough."

Carrera told Zess the truth with an innocent smile on her face, a truth that would cause Zess to despair. It was a very devilish act, but Carrera did so without realizing it.

"...I am...inferior? I should be the next god of creation..." Zess muttered regretfully.
And those were his last words.


![soft scene break]


Carrera did not feel any sense of accomplishment even as she faced the demise of her powerful enemy. Without even a moment to feel the afterglow of the battle, she began to go to the aid of Gobta and the others.
But just then, the enemy, who had been hiding in plain sight, finally made his move.

"Fufufu. I've been waiting for this moment."

"Huh?!"

Carrera, who had not felt anything until now, was startled by the pain running down her arms. It was not just pain, but a sign of damage being taken. She was hit with an incredibly heavy and violent impact, with both her arms barely defending her vital points.
The attack was a kick from Insect Lord Zelanus, who appeared to have overcome even Carrera's 'Universal Perception'.
Carrera reacted quickly, but anyone else would have been finished off by the blow.

"Kuh, I knew you'd show up, but you sure are in a hurry."

"If an enemy can be hit, one should not hesitate to crush them."

Just as he said, Insect Lord Zelanus had been looking for an opportunity to beat Carrera. He was confident in his overwhelming superiority, but still, he kept his eyes vigilantly on Carrera until the time for victory, fearing the possibility that he might be defeated.
It was Carrera's 'Judgment' that he had been on the lookout for.

![break]

Minaza, who he had sent as an observer, had reported about a man named Kondou. Although Kondou had not revealed all of his powers, Minaza, who had been observing him, had judged that he was "highly dangerous with unknown powers" and Zelanus had taken this seriously.
Remembering this, he had also asked Michael and Feldway and knew that Kondou's power had been transferred to Carrera. He had made a few predictions for the current operation.

In Michael's case, 'Castle Guard' seemed to have prevented the attack, but Zelanus had no such ability. He had been waiting for Carrera to use her nasty power, because he was afraid that his own defenses would not be enough.
This timidity and cautiousness were the factors that make Zelanus the strongest. And now, after waiting for a long time, his worries were finally gone.
They had lost an important piece in Zess, but on the other hand, it was a good thing to have been so cautious.

*It was a very powerful shot, even for an enemy. If I had been hit by it, I would not have been able to survive.*

Despite his admiration, Zelanus' worries were already a thing of the past. Now that everything had been taken care of, there was no longer any sense of danger for Carrera.

![break]

Carrera also saw through Zelanus and understood the danger.

*This guy is dangerous. Geez, it's like there's no bottom to his strength...*

It was as if she was facing Zegion, no, it was even worse than that. Zelanus had no openings, and she felt like she had no clue how to attack him.
Despite her displeasure, she had to admit it.
Insect Lord Zelanus was stronger than Menace Lord Carrera.
But even so...

Even so, that did not mean that Carrera would give up so easily.

"Ehh? Aren't you a little bit petty for a man who calls himself a king?" Carrera spoke hatefully.

But Zelanus was even better at quarreling than Carrera.

"Huh, demonstrating bravado at this late stage of the battle, the demons are all losers at heart." He looked down on Carrera with the air of a victor, calm and composed.

"Perhaps you think you've already won? That's being a little too arrogant in front of me." Even with that retort, Carrera's expression did not show any room for complacency.

After all, Carrera's arms had been shattered by Zelanus' mere kick. It was difficult for Carrera to even hold the Golden Gun, let alone grip a sword.
Carrera's skeleton was originally made of Rimuru's special orichalcum and had now evolved into hihiirokane. It possessed the strength, hardness, and viscosity equivalent to that of mythical-grade armor, and had indestructible properties.
And yet...

If she had been injured by a mythical-grade weapon, she would have understood, but it was unexpected that a mere kick could cause this much damage.
That alone made her aware of the threat level of Insect Lord Zelanus.

The secret was revealed as soon as she looked upon Insect Lord Zelanus's entire body.
His exoskeleton was shining in rainbow colors. It was the very brilliance of hihiirokane.

*I didn't expect to see hihiirokane all over his body...*

Looking at his body, it was obvious that Insect Lord Zelanus was the ultimate form of life capable of both offense and defense. His whole body was like a deadly weapon and the strongest shield.
Carrera slowly observed the whole of Zelanus.
The silvery cilia running from his forehead to his back looked like long hair. However, upon closer inspection, each hair was covered with tiny protuberances that resembled the shape of a blade. Even the cilia were assumed to be made of hihiirokane, since they appeared to be iridescent when viewed from different angles.

*Does this mean that each of those hairs is a mythical-grade blade? I don't know how to manipulate them, but if I'm not careful, they might cut me into tiny pieces.*

A pair of antennae were swaying on his forehead. Two pairs of wings on his back and hips glowed red, and three pairs of arms were alertly poised.

*Those wings are also dangerous. They are terribly dense, but is it because they are compressed with energy? If I release them, the shape of the star might be altered...*

It would probably be more destructive than Carrera's extreme magic. That's how much energy she could feel from those two pairs of wings.

And then, there were the three pairs of arms.
One pair of arms was folded casually, but the other two pairs were ready for battle. The lowest arms, crossed in front of the abdomen, were ready to cast a spell at any moment. In addition, the arms in the upper part were discolored and deformed from the middle, becoming thin like a blade, and shining dully.
If the first blow had been made with those thin arms, it was highly probable that Carrera's arms would have been amputated.

As Carrera continued to observe, Zelanus placed one foot on Zess, who was prone on the ground. It looked like he was stepping on his son, but the reality was worse than that.

"What are you---"

Carrera's answer was a gurgling, grinding, chewing sound coming from Zelanus' feet.
That's right. Zelanus was eating Zess, his son and head of the Insect Generals, right in front of Carrera.

"You know, this guy was proudly saying that he was the next god of creation... Did you intend to use him as a pawn from the beginning?" Carrera asked with narrowed eyes.

"Ridiculous!" Zelanus laughed. "My successor must be the strongest. Even more so than myself."

"..."

"There is no way someone weaker than me can become the god of creation."

Then suddenly, Zelanus moved. With the mouth that had appeared on the sole of his foot, he had finished eating Zess. He had absorbed knowledge and experience in order to take Zess; power for himself. As evidence of this, Zelanus' speech had become fluent without an accent.
And his power---

Carrera tried desperately to take a defensive position. But her hand would not move.

*Not good!! If I get hit by that, I'll take irreparable damage!!*

Although her thoughts were running a million times faster than before, reality was truly merciless.
At least, it hadn't been up until now in Carrera's life up until now...

But apparently, this was not that moment.
Zelanus' kick was caught by someone.

"Wahahahaha! It's my turn now. I'll stop holding myself back!!"

The girl who appeared had platinum pink hair and was smiling happily.
It was Carrera's new friend and one of the strongest in the world---Demon Lord Milim Nava.


![soft scene break]


"Carrera, I'll take care of him!"

With these words, Milim and Zelanus entered into full-scale combat. Then, Carrera was out of the picture.

"Well, it can't be helped. I'm still inexperienced, let's just recover quickly."

Carrera changed her mindset quickly and calmly. While recovering herself, she turned her attention to the battle situation of Obera's team.
The battle was fiercer than she had expected. With Carrera's defeat of Zess, only Peliod and Mujika remained as Insect Generals. However, those two were still very troublesome.
The most notable opponent was Peliod, the wife of Insect Lord Zelanus and the creator of all the insects. She seemed to be growing more and more powerful.

To fight against Peliod, five members led by Obera, excluding Midley, were fighting against her.
Obera was leading and acting as a wall. As soon as she was exhausted, Geld would move forward and take her place. The remaining three, Karion, Frey, and Gobta & Ranga, were playing guerrilla tactics and repeatedly attacking Peliod.

This was, in Carrera's opinion, a very dangerous strategy.
For the exhausted Karion and Frey, even though they were of an awakened class, even a single blow from Peliod could be fatal. And although Obera and Geld were distracting the enemy, one wrong move could result in a catastrophe. This was why the roles of Obera and Geld were so important here. Especially now that there was no healer, this battle would not be possible without Geld and his high self-regeneration ability.

Midley was battling against Mujika in place of Geld. It seemed to be a one-on-one battle.
Mujika, who had greatly increased in power, was much stronger than Midley in terms of existence value alone. However, the battle was still close, going back-and-forth. The reason for this lay in Midley's seriousness.
He, not in a mood to be shy about showing off his skills, had lifted all the restrictions he had imposed on himself and even displayed his 'Dragon Body' which he had never shown except when he was fighting against Milim. His limbs were covered with dragon scales while still retaining his human form. The whole body under his clothes was similarly protected other than at the joints.

Of course, this was not to say that his existence value increased, but only that the dragon man was exercising his power to the fullest. In other words, Midley was now in a state where all restraints and limitations were lifted.
Perhaps because of this, the fighters were engaged in a heated battle, even engaging in high level psychological warfare as they tried to analyze each other's abilities.

"Heh, As expected of Midley-san. I was curious to see if he was better than Zegion, but after all, it's a close match!"

Carrera, who was watching the battle, was impressed by Midley's strength.
Mujika, who was a warrior by nature, possessed a certain level of skill. Otherwise, he would have been defeated by Geld long ago.
His existence value had increased by several times even though he had been on an equal footing with Geld before the reinforcement. Even when compared to Midley, Mujika's value was more than three times higher than Midley's, and there was an overwhelming gap between the two.

Since Midley was able to compete with this Mujika, it was easy to understand how insane he really was.
To be honest, Zegion would win in a serious fight. However, if Zegion was fighting with the same amount of power as Midley...

In Carrera's opinion, the two were evenly matched in skill-level.


![hard scene break]


After some fierce battling, Midley and Mujika were facing each other. Both of them were searching for an opening and were unable to attack the other. Then, Mujika opened his mouth.

"Why don't we do this? Let me hear your name."

"I'm Midley. Won't you introduce yourself as well? It will be worth remembering if it's a name coming from someone so fierce that it amuses me."

Despite being enemies, Midley and Mujika acknowledged one another. Especially Mujika seemed to have become more human after 'Life Reconstruction', and his technique was less mechanical and more brilliant.
Midley, perhaps sensing this change, sincerely approved of Mujika's performance. Otherwise, he would not have exposed his full strength.
But this was still a battlefield, and both men were enemies. They acknowledged each other, but they were still trying to kill the other.

Midley laughed and brought out his left fist in a fluid motion. He pulled back his left fist faster than the speed at which he thrust it and used the recoil to throw a spinning kick.

This was a so-called feint, but in Midley's case, it was not the only thing. When he clenched his fist for the first time, he had compressed the air and shot it out. Moreover, since he mixed the air with fighting aura, the power of his fists was more powerful than that of a mana bullet.

Mujika had his sword ready in response to the fist, so he was able to repel the compressed air bullet. However, immediately after that, Midley's kick cleanly entered the gap left by lifting the sword to the upper level.

"Nng."

The force of the kick, which penetrated under Mujika's armor, ran through his entire body and affected his physical functions. Needless to say, Midley's kicks were also filled with fighting aura.
Midley was a master of 'Battlewill'.

Just as the school of the Dragon Fist had sprouted in the other world where Velgrynd had arrived, even here in the Cardinal World, a unique style had been passed down.
This style, which combined basic movements similar to those of traditional jiu-jitsu and physical manipulation of the body via fighting aura, also expressed the unrestrained spirit of Milim, the founder of the art.
There was no name for this school of art, but if it were to be named, it would be the Dracofist Style. Incidentally, there was no ritual of inheriting a soul as was the case in the Dragon Fist. The knowledge and experience accumulated by the person were all that they acquired.

The lifespan of a person in the Cardinal World varied widely and could be greatly extended depending on how that person lived. Simply by practicing discipline and taking care of one's physical condition with Battlewill, one's lifespan could be extended several times over, and if you were an ancestral pureblood like Midley, you could even live over a thousand years.
In fact, Midley was over 2,000 years old. He was strong because he had spent all that time in training.

Mujika was hit by Midley's kick and instinctively took a step backward. Then he glanced at the impacted area and was astonished. His shell armor, which could not be damaged from any non-lethal attacks, had been dented and crushed.
The lower-ranked insectar soldiers had no sense of fear, so they repeatedly launched suicide attacks as ordered, no matter how superior they were. However, the higher ranks, due to their scarcity, instinctively understood the difference in strength between them and their opponents.

As an Insect General, his sense was quite accurate, and he could easily estimate his opponents' fighting ability. However, this was limited only to direct abilities, so he was unable to detect Skill abilities. And, of course, he was unable to see how much the target had been trained without actually fighting them.

Mujika was now on the maximum alert against Midley because of the blow he had just received. Although he had been empowered by Peliod, he calmly judged that he might lose if the battle was prolonged. In that case, the only thing he could do was to show his respect to his opponent by giving his all with his best technique.

"Taste my technique: Devouring Fangs."

Mujika's weapon, strictly speaking, was not a sword. It was alienium forged into a blade. And now that Mujika had evolved, it had become even sharper. Furthermore, Mujika's mana was poured into the blade, which was comparable to a mythical-grade blade, and it had become so powerful that it could sever any substance. This blade approached Midley.
However, Midley remained unmoving.

"Nuu!" Increasing his aura^[The words 'aura' and 'spirit' can be used pretty interchangeably in Midley's case. It's basically battle aura/fighting spirit that he uses.], he caught Mujika's blade with his left arm.

That's right, he caught it.
A hard and unpleasant sound echoed. It was a melody played by the shockwave generated by the collision of equal strength and hardness.

"How can this be...?!"

"Why are you surprised? If you had the spirit, you could easily use your own body as a weapon."

It was not easy.
In this case, Mujika's reaction was only natural. However, Midley was a man who was always trained to deal with the unreasonableness of Milim. He had no idea that his logic was insane to ordinary people, and he never doubted that it was normal.
Of course, it couldn't be done with just willpower. It was a solid technique, though the reason was that he was covered with dragon scales.

Midley controlled his own fighting spirit and hardened his body. He anticipated where the attack would come and focused all his attention on that part of the body even if it might lower the defenses of other parts of his body. This had given his left arm enough defensive power to withstand mythical-grade weapons, so it would be quite reckless to attribute it all to mere spirit. It was only possible because it was Midley.

Midley's essence was of the Dragon God status that Gabil would someday reach, and with his divine physical strength, he could compete with mythical-grade fighters with his guts in the name of spirit.
And, of course, his skills were not limited to defense.

"Now it's my turn."

Midley spoke with a grin, dropping his left hand from the sword and lowering his stance. In karate, this was known as the horse-stance^[Also known as a "square stance" in traditional karate. (Fun fact: it's the stance Toph uses from Avatar: The Last Airbender)]. Then, he diverted the huge amount of energy generated in his left arm to his right fist. Furthermore, from his feet, which were in contact with the earth, he took in the energy of the earth's flowing veins, accumulating the energy of the planet itself into his body.

This was the essence of the 'Dragon Demon Fist', the 'Star-Body Assimilation'. Of course, the physical burden was unimaginable, but Midley was able to overcome it with his spirit. He thought only about winning, not about what would come after.

"Nuh?!" By the time Mujika could sense the danger, it was already too late.

"Draconic Blast!!"

This was Midley's ultimate technique, the most powerful technique he could unleash, easily surpassing even the Draconic Cannon.
At first glance, it was just a straight fist thrust, exactly the same as the one that had smashed Insect General Saril's body to pieces, but its power was beyond the laws and common sense of this world.
For Mujika, it was the same---he finally understood Midley's abnormality after a gaping hole was made in the center of his chest through the shell armor, but it was already too late.

*I'm not sure being vigilant would be enough...I must be going senile...*

Mujika thought his final thoughts.
But for some reason, the defeat felt good.
Mujika died satisfied, not as an Insect General, but as a warrior.


![hard scene break]


*Not bad, Midley-san,* Carrera's eyes widened.

He was already a very likable person, but his strength was worth admiring even from Carrera's point of view. Simply watching the advanced offense and defense of an awakened master gave Carrera the feeling that she had gained a great deal of experience.
But for now, the priority was to deal with the remaining problem, Peliod.
Now that Midley had defeated Mujika, it was time to launch an all-out battle. It would be nice if Carrera could join them, but she was not ready to move just yet.
Zelanus' blow had been that deadly.

Carrera felt frustrated at her inadequacy and analyzed the situation calmly.

*Geez, these bugs are seriously troublesome...*

Those were her true feelings and conclusion.
Just now, Peliod's power had increased even further. While it was good that Mujika was defeated, Peliod had also been strengthened. The reason was that she had taken Mujika's power.

The power of Zess had been directly taken by Zelanus. Therefore, there was no collection for Peliod. However, once Mujika died on the battlefield, all of his power was absorbed into Peliod. By using that, Peliod could perform a Life Reconstruction on her own body as well. This was why Peliod's power was so troublesome on the battlefield.

Peliod's whole body was now covered with warrior-like armor, and in her hands was a sinister sword. Having taken Mujika's characteristics and experience as her own, Peliod now appeared to be capable of fighting melee combat.

*Her weaknesses seem to be disappearing more and more. When it comes to taking away the power of the fallen in this battlefield, I am very grateful for Milord's policy of no casualties*

The power of those who died on this battlefield, whether friend or foe, would flow into Peliod. The only way to break such a condition was to destroy the barriers that cover the battlefield.
But that was impossible.
This was because not only Insect Lord Zelanus, the enemy leader, but even Demon Lord Milim was making efforts to maintain the barriers.
If they hadn't, this planet itself would have disappeared long ago.

Zelanus' goal was to dominate the planet, not to destroy it. It was the only reason why the two sides agreed on this point and the environmental protection using the 'Barrier' was naturally maintained. However, as a result, Peliod's unrivaled state was established. It was a very troublesome situation, but it was already too late to realize it now.

*But well, it doesn't seem like she'll get any stronger...right? Don't be too hasty. I just have to find a way to get to the bottom of this.*

There were no insectar survivors other than the King and the Queen. Unless there were casualties from the allied camps, there was no doubt that she couldn't be strengthened any further.
And naturally, Obera and Midley correctly understood the situation as Carrera did. Therefore, they could not take any reckless suicide attacks or self-sacrificing tactics. The only course of action was to continue the endurance battle, which was a passive but steady approach to inflicting damage.

That said, since this had been the strategy from the beginning, no one was feeling particularly impatient. Even though Peliod was strengthened, the plan remained the same, and they maintained the strategy centering on Obera and Geld, steadily waiting for Peliod to get exhausted.

*As expected, however...*

Even though the powerful reinforcement Midley had joined the battle, the situation was not getting better. Rather, it was getting worse.

*At this rate, we will be defeated.* Carrera felt a sense of crisis.

The battle between Milim and Zelanus was on a different level and far outside of her consciousness.
What she needed to think about now was how to attack Peliod before any of her friends were killed.
There was nothing decisive.
It was a miracle that the battle was even balanced, and such a tightrope situation could not last for long. Even a single mistake would lead to a defeat in the battle like a dam bursting from a single ant hole.

Before that happened, she had to do something.
Carrera's expression turned angry as she glared at her motionless right arm.
If she couldn't move now, there was no reason to be here.
In other words, it was a big problem that even affected Carrera's reason for existence.
That was why she asked for strength.
In that moment, the Golden Gun glowed faintly.

![break]

<In that case, I will lend you my power.>

![break]

Carrera heard a voice that should not have been heard.
She was startled for the first time in a long time.
And the next moment...


![hard scene break]


The battle was a second-coming of a myth.

![break]

Milim and Zelanus' fists cut through the sky, rippling the atmosphere and shaking the earth.
It was so violent that even the stars could have shattered, but that didn't happen for one reason.
Zelanus and Milim were protecting this battlefield with their own 'Defense Barriers'.
This was also the reason why Milim had not joined the battle in the beginning. She had assessed the effects of Carrera's 'Abyss Annihilation' and calculated the damage that this battle would cause to the earth. Based on that, she began working to protect the planet itself with a Barrier.

Milim was a tyrant, but she was also a thoughtful person.
Despite saying and doing whatever she wished, behind the scenes, she understood exactly what the consequences of her actions were. That was Milim Nava, a demon lord who managed both sides of the coin.
And so, Milim had handed over the role of rampaging to Carrera, but she soon realized that there was someone else trying to protect this planet.
It was, of course, the enemy leader, Insect Lord Zelanus himself.

*Hm. He seems to be thinking the same thing as I am. That's a bit troublesome...*

Zelanus' actions were unexpected even for Milim.
It made sense that he would try to protect this planet as the one trying to invade this world. However, Milim was not so easily convinced.
If it was just a normal 'Barrier', it would have been fine, but it had also been given an effect that was convenient for the enemy. That's why she wanted to destroy it, but that would affect her own 'Barrier' as well, which could cause serious damage to the planet.

*You have some nerve to use my 'Barrier'!*

Despite such frustrations, she was unable to make any rash moves due to the situation. The current situation was proof that the enemy leader was capable, so she could not afford to lose her temper.
Even Milim, who could solve most problems with violence, had to act cautiously in the face of an enemy who might be her equal.
While patiently waiting for the right moment, her turn finally came.

![break]

Zelanus made a move.
Milim tried to move immediately, but there was a problem. Zelanus had carefully set up the 'Barrier' so that Milim could not break through it. Although it took less than ten seconds to disarm it, the delay was a blunder that could have been fatal.
In the end, the effect was only a little annoyance, but it did not change the fact that she had been outmaneuvered. Milim regretted it but praised it honestly and calmly vowed to make it up to Carrera. This was because she had arrived during Carrera's crisis just in time. Carrera would not have died, but if it had been fatal, it was unclear what would have happened to Milim's anger.

It was a relief to the world as well.
At any rate, the worst was over for Milim, and all that remained was to defeat Zelanus.
She happily joined the war and began to fight against Zelanus.

![break]

Zelanus was strong.
He took Milim's fists without hesitation and hit back sharply. Milim also took it in stride, landing kicks, elbows, and head-butts in a flowing motion. Zelanus, too, did not lag behind Milim, but responded to here in an impressive manner.
Both fighters fought fiercely, using only their bodies as weapons.

"You're pretty good. I didn't expect you to keep up with me this much, even though I'm not taking it easy on you!"

"Heh, ridiculous. I was a bit wary of how powerful you would be as the Creator's daughter, but I guess it's not that big of a deal."

Zelanus responded to Milim's flippant words with a pompous attitude, but in fact, he was not letting his guard down. Inwardly, he was merely acting condescending to Milim with the utmost caution.
Zelanus was cautious, as evidenced by how wary he was of Carrera's 'Judgment'. Pride meant nothing to Zelanus.

Even though he was an absolutely powerful being, he was never overconfident. The essence of Zelanus was someone who gave his all without letting his guard down, no matter who the opponent was. For that reason, Zelanus did not limit his vigilance to Milim alone. It was natural for Zelanus to always do his best, not just against powerful enemies but also against weak ones.

Thus, he had set up the 'Barrier' to delay Milim's entry into the battle. In that instant, he was going to take out Carrera and take her power for himself. But that did not happen because Milim's computing power was much greater than Zelanus had expected, and Carrera was also more stubborn than he had imagined.
For Zelanus, the failure to finish off Carrera was a painful setback.

If Carrera recovered and joined hands with Milim, it would be a problem. In addition, if they were forced into a war of endurance, she might use 'Judgment' again, which was limited to once a day. If he analyzed the situation calmly, he could not afford to be optimistic.
Therefore, Zelanus had used a sophisticated tactic in his conversation with Milim.

*It would be profitable if she could let her guard down with this, but just what is the extent of the Creator's daughter?*

Zelanus was wondering how Milim would react.
Milim, on the other hand, showed a wide smile with an arrogant attitude.

"Wahahahaha! So you say. In that case, entertain me some more!"

Milim was now in her true form for the first time. Beautiful crimson horns sprouted from her forehead, parting her lovely platinum pink hair. From her back, she spread her dragon wings and was donned in jet-black armor. In her hand, she was holding Asura, which had been given to her by Guy.
It was rare for Milim to use a weapon.
No matter what was said, she had acknowledged Zelanus to that extent.
Zelanus also realized that his act was not working on Milim. In that case, there was no point in keeping it up.

"Why are you so cautious if you're so strong? Is it cowardice?" Milim asked him curiously, and Zelanus answered as he pleased without hiding anything.

"Heh, just what is cowardice? I would rather be victorious as a coward than be defeated by the enemy without fear."

Without losing his kingly bearing, Zelanus asserted that he had nothing to be ashamed of. Those were Zelanus' true feelings, and he was proud of them.

"Victorious, you say? Just what is it that you want?"

"Heh, so you understand. To surpass the Creator is my mission."

That was Zelanus' true intention.
In fact, Zelanus had been thinking about the reason for his existence ever since he had been named by Veldanava.
He was not blinded by respect for the Creator as Feldway was, but rather had continued trying to figure out what he should do.
The answer he came up with: "surpassing his creator".

Zelanus' body was immortal. Every cell in his body was controlled by his mind and could not only be regenerated instantly, but also reproduced. Zelanus was not affected by illness or injury, and his existence transcended mortality.
Even so, he could die if his energy was depleted.
Even if his body was immortal, his spirit had a limit.
In other words, he was not immortal.

Zelanus had to surpass Veldanava at some point. Since he was unable to resist death in his current state, he was determined to improve himself by all possible means, even with cowardice.
That is why he increased the number of his subordinates without completing the task on his own.
At great risk, he created Peliod to be his mate. He gave birth to children with her to be his own hands and feet.

The children, like their parent Zelanus, also sought strength.
Zess was especially like him, and just like Zelanus, he was very cowardly.
He was also cruel and cunning.
Sensing the possibility that his newborn "younger brother" could threaten him, he tried to nip that in the bud. He even plotted to eat the individual who was born as the next generation's queen and take their power for his own.

That attempt seemed to have failed, but none of that was of Zelanus' concern.
He'd let them do what they wished.
If Zess were to become the next god of creation, that would have been a joyous occasion.
Either he, the parent, or Zess, the son. The winner would be justified, and the next century would be built by the winner. However, Zelanus had no intention of giving up his throne, and he would have taken Zess's power when he grew up.

Zelanus always had an accurate grasp of Zess's power by loving him and gaining his trust, all to ensure his own victory.
This time, because of the dangerous presence of Carrera, he was able to make good use of Zess as a stepping stone. Zelanus was satisfied with the result because he was able to take away Zess's power.
As long as someone as strong as Zelanus remained cunning and cautious, he was as good as impregnable. That is why Zelanus responded to Milim without any shame.

![break]

Milim realized that Zelanus was more dangerous than expected. She felt that if Zelanus was not defeated at this point, he could become an unmanageable disaster, so she decided that she should do her utmost to eliminate him.

"I would have liked to play with you more, but unfortunately you are dangerous. Sorry, but I'm going to have to take things seriously from now on."

With a serious expression on her face, Milim declared this to Zelanus. Then she released her power without a word.
At this point, even Zelanus could not afford to lose any more time. He had no other choice but to put in everything he had.

"Ridiculous. I'll deal with you as entertainment before taking the summit. Show me the power of the creator's daughter!!"

No longer worrying about the impact on the world, the accumulated evil power was unleashed.
The power of the two opponents grew, and the air trembled.
As long as there is no significant gap between their skill-levels, the battle would only prolong if they continued to chip away at each other. This was the common understanding, and it was why Milim had chosen to use her special magic to destroy the enemy in a short-term annihilation.

In response, Zelanus also refined his fighting aura.
The clash of Milim's high energy and Zelanus' fighting energy generated plasma combustions all over the space.
The aftermath alone was powerful enough to crush any poor monster into tiny pieces.
Even a greater majin would not be able to survive if caught in such an explosion.

No third party could be allowed to enter the battlefield where such a tremendous explosion was raging wildly. They had already evacuated long ago and were watching the situation from a distance outside the 'Barrier'.
If they had been even a little late in escaping, they would have been in a hellscape by now. Even so, the real work had yet to start despite such a force being generated.

"I'll show you the best! Drago Nova!!"

Stardust sparkled between Milim's hands, and a force of unworldly destruction began to swirl about them. Milim gathered it into a bundle and launched it at Zelanus.


![full page image](image4.jpg){Milim firing a Kame-Milim-ha! (Licensed by Master Veldoroshi)}


Even if you had the power to twist space like Peliod, it was impossible to take everything in. Milim, with that in mind, struck with the power of a tyrant.
It was an outrageous move befitting of the title "Destroyer," but in this case, she was correct. In a battle between supernaturals, the longer the fight went on, the more serious the damage would be. Since the current 'Barrier' was a combination of the power of both Milim and Zelanus, Milim used it to the utmost limit to set up a fight.
On the other hand, like Milim, Zelanus chose a deadly special technique to annihilate the enemy.

"Devour them all, 'Devastator Virus'!!"

Fine microparticles of darkness rose from Zelanus' body and blocked the Drago Nova's brilliance as if they had a will of their own.
They were the dark cells that made up Zelanus' body.
Zelanus, who could manipulate the matter taken in from other worlds at will, was able to make his own body microscopic and invade his enemy's body. The tiny, willful cells could break through even a 'Barrier' and devour the target from the inside, making it impossible for ordinary people to even resist.

The sparkling light emitted by Milim intersected with the dark particles controlled by Zelanus.
While the light drove out the darkness, the darkness swallowed the light.
It was only a moment in time, but that moment was so tense that it seemed infinite.
And it was an unfavorable situation for both parties.

Milim had intended to win overwhelmingly, and Zelanus had intended to devour Milim with his cells.
Finally, the outcome of the battle was revealed.

![break]

When the light and darkness converged, there stood Milim.
The dark microparticles had clung to Milim's body, but they were extinguished by Milim's haki. Milim, though fatigued, was unharmed.
And as for Zelanus?

"...So, this is pain. I didn't think there was anything I couldn't devour..."

Surprisingly, he was still safe.
Milim's Drago Nova was mainly composed of a special substance called stardust. It was a substance with destructive power beyond that of spiritrons, which only Milim could control, and unless its properties could be analyzed, it was uncontrollable for any human being.
It was only natural that Zelanus had failed in his attempt to eat it.

However, while not eating it, Zelanus did succeed in killing it. Although some damage was sustained, it was at a sufficiently regenerative level to the point that it had no effect on the continuation of the battle.
Milim suffered mental exhaustion and Zelanus suffered some physical wear and tear. That was the only result of this exchange of fire.
Zelanus quickly stood up and stared at Milim with his compound eyes.
Then he thought to himself.

*Can I really win this fight?*

Being the daughter of the creator, Milim was strong. It was said that she had inherited most of the creator's power, but it seemed that she still had more hidden in her.
Zelanus was sure of this.

He was sure of this because he had seen the Barren Lands, the site where she had once fought a deadly battle with the Demon Lord Guy.
As is typical of the cautious Zelanus, he was well informed. The land, also called the Desert of Death, was created more than 2,000 years ago, yet it was still contaminated by dense magicules.
The power of Milim's Drago Nova was tremendous, but it was not contaminated to that extent. Therefore, he should assume that there was something more.
The uncertainty of what that was made Zelanus feel uneasy.

For Zelanus, victory at all costs is not what he wanted. He needed to win safely and surely.
Zelanus' belief was absolute, and based on that belief, any further battle was dangerous.
There was no such thing as a "just in case" and Milim was still an unknown variable...

Zelanus was considering retreat at this point.
Shortly after this, an event occurred that forced Zelanus to make a decision.


![hard scene break]


Carrera heard the voice of someone who should not have been here and realized that this was no longer the time to spectate.
It was not possible, she thought, but she was not so foolish as to doubt the reality of the situation.

"Hey, did I fail to die?"

"Hmph, you've been summoned from the other world because I wasn't good enough."

The one smiling wryly was Lieutenant Kondou, who was supposed to have died by Carrera's hand.
Unknown to Carrera, Masayuki's Ultimate Skill 'King of Heroes' had been activated just before this. In other words, the Kondou here was a physical entity, though not a living one. He was as real as the real thing, and yet not the real thing, a "dead champion (Einherjar^[In Norse mythology, the 'Einherjar' were ghostly warriors who died in battle and were brought to Valhalla by the Valkyries.])" that was of the same quality as a Digital Lifeform. It would have normally been impossible, but through Masayuki's ability, he had rushed to Carrera in her perilous situation.

"Well then. I hope you're not saying that this is the end for the devil who killed me."

"That's right, of course not. I was about to beat him to a pulp, but then you interrupted me."

Kondou, too, did not ask back with a "How?"
With a fearless smile, he nodded his head in an "In that case, good," fashion.

"I will lend you my strength as well, so please forgive me."

It was a very natural offer of cooperation.
And Carrera accepted it as a matter of course.

"Well, why not? I'm like this too, so I'll borrow it."

She did not care about her pride as a demon.
No, rather, she seemed to be quite happy.
And thus, a powerful combination was born.

![break]

Even in this moment, the two were casually having a meeting.

"So, what's the plan? Are you going to take him down?"

Carrera calmly made unreasonable demands as soon as he became an ally.
Kondou was also taken aback, but then let out a sigh and began to explain.

"As good as I am, even I can't beat that."

Kondou was realistic.
Even though he had only just appeared in this world, he remained calm and aware of the situation.
Based on this, he made a very rational decision.

"But right now, fortunately, his eyes are on other people."

"Huh?"

"If you can't win with a straightforward attack, just use subterfuge."

Kondou said that and then placed his hand on Carrera's.


![full page image](image5.jpg){The ghost of Kondou places his hand on Carrera's shoulder: It's high noon, Carrera.}


To be more precise, he intended to put his power into the Golden Gun in Carrera's hands.

"Suddenly holding hands is a little embarrassing, isn't it?"

"Shut up. Now is not the time for jokes like that."

Actually, Carrera meant what she said quite seriously. Nevertheless, she was coldly dismissed and felt quite offended.
However, Kondou was correct.
It was indeed an important time to defeat the enemy in order to prevent any harm to her fellow comrades.
Carrera focused her attention on what Kondou was planning to do.
Then he noticed it.

"I see, it's your 'Judgment'."

"That's right. I put all my strength into this bullet. You just need to concentrate on controlling it."

*You know how to use it, don't you?* there was no need to ask such questions.

Kondou trusted Carrera.
She sensed this and was in a better mood.

"Yeah, leave it to me."

And so, she agreed with a big smile on her face.


![hard scene break]


Peliod was the ruler of the battlefield.
Despite the twists and turns, things had generally gone according to plan.
What she didn't like was that there were not as many deaths as expected.
Moreover, there were no casualties from the enemy forces.
Even if some of them were injured seriously enough to leave the battlefield, it appeared they were being given first aid with magic and recovery medicine, so none of them would die.

She had been planning to collect the power of the dead in this battlefield after going through great lengths to form a special barrier, but she was unable to achieve the expected results.

*Well, even so, I was able to devour my children and integrate their powers. I suppose you could say that was a success.*

In fact, Peliod's current power was much stronger than it had been at the beginning of the battle. It was not simply the mere difference of energy values, but also the combination of the children's skill-levels.
Adding the newly acquired melee combat ability to the 'Spatial Domination' that she had been so good at from the beginning, it was impossible for her to fall behind the small fry that clung to her. However, the small fry---Obera, Midley, Karion, Frey, Geld, and Gobta & Ranga---worked brilliantly together to minimize damage. Peliod was never fatally wounded, but when she tried to defeat them, it was surprisingly difficult.
This irritated Peliod.

*This is not funny. Even with all the power I've gained, I am still unable to defeat these guys...*

If she took her time, she would surely win. Despite this understanding, Peliod was unable to suppress her frustration.
One person in particular whom she did not like was the majin named Geld. Although he was not as strong as the current Peliod, he was unusually sturdy.
He should have died long ago.

Even though she had hit him directly multiple times with attacks that were intended to kill, he kept getting back up again and again.
Moreover, those eyes of his were detestable.
Even though he should have clearly understood the difference in their power, he was still staring at Peliod as if he would never give up. It was as if he was sure of his victory.

*Just stop joking around already. That's the kind of look I should be giving you guys!*

The thing with Obera was still understandable. Peliod had sent insectar scouts to investigate the cryptids, so of course she was informed of Obera's army as the opposing force. And after having witnessed her strength in this battle, she was aware of the danger that was posed.
That's why she had Obera fire those two big shots in order to exhaust her. She never looked down on her. However, she did not expect that Geld would be such a nuisance.

*He was only as good as Mujika before the 'Life Reconstruction', but his durability is abnormal. I wonder how long he can withstand my attacks...*

This was why specialized types were so troublesome... Peliod kept her composure while trying her best to calm down her inner frustration. Then, as if to take out her anger, she swung her appendages to launch a 'Dimensional Slash'.
However, most of the slashes were offset by Geld's 'Chaos Eater,' and the remaining slashes were also neatly avoided, only serving to increase Peliod's anger.

This was not because Peliod was lacking in ability, but because Geld and the others were doing their best with their lives on the line.

![break]

Gobta had overcome his fear and devoted himself to troubling Peliod.
Trusting Gobta, Ranga fully cooperated.

Midley enjoyed fighting, but he understood that if he died, it would be the end. He overcame those fears and was fighting purely to kill Peliod.

Karion and Frey were repeatedly attacking Peliod from the air and land, fully utilizing their awakened power. Indeed, their training in Ramiris' labyrinth had paid off. Without that experience, they would have been forced to leave the front lines long ago due to a misallocation of forces.

Obera was still Obera, and she read the situation very precisely to give the best instructions. Geld was safe because she had been accurately switching the role of the shields.

As for Geld, his consciousness was already hazy.

As Peliod had predicted, it was a miracle that he was still alive.
He remained standing with his spirit alone.
The 'full body armor' that had become one with his ability had cracked and shattered, leaving only remnants. And his body had long since exceeded their limits, so battered that even the 'Ultraspeed Regeneration' could not keep up.
The only reason why he was still able to fight was because of the secret of Geld's power.
His Ultimate Gift 'Gourmet King Beelzebub' included the 'Grant Protection' ability, which increased the defense of his comrades, and the 'Substitute' ability, which took the damage taken by others. Moreover, by combining these two abilities, one could achieve a completely different effect. In other words, it had the effect of transferring the damage you received onto others. Geld was able to distribute his damage to his subordinates while adjusting the amount of damage he took.
But even that had limits.
His subordinates claimed to be able to endure more, but Geld knew this to be a lie.
Everyone had reached their limits, just as he had.
Still, Geld stood.
He looked forward and did not look away from Peliod.

*The one who looks away from the fight, loses.* He was simply following Rimuru's words.

It was really a casual remark said at a drinking party, but to Geld, it was the best thing he had ever heard. Even if it was not true, he believed that he could change it into the truth with his own power. That's the kind of man Geld was.
However, even Geld had his limits.
He was attacked again, and finally fell to his knees.

"Muu...I can't get up!"

"Ufufufufu, you finally sank," Peliod laughed. "I'll congratulate you for your good performance, so let's kill you once and for all."

It was not out of mercy that she left Geld on the back burner, but that she was going to slowly torture him later. It was purely an experiment to see how much of an attack he could withstand. Besides, it would have been foolish to only be concerned with Geld at this point. Since the others were not as durable as Geld, she decided that she should remove the threat as soon as possible.
Now that the obstacle was gone, victory was assured.

![break]

The only concern was that Zelanus, Peliod's lord, had entered into battle with Demon Lord Milim, and the outcome of that battle was uncertain.
It was still as planned.

However, the power of Demon Lord Milim was unknown.
Peliod did not doubt Zelanus' victory, but she wanted to go to the aid of Zelanus as soon as possible to make sure of it.

*Well, now that this stubborn fellow is down, the other small fry will be easily taken care of.*

Confident in her victory, Peliod was about to launch her special technique against Obera and the others---then she suddenly stopped.
It was because a chill ran down her spine.
She sensed the presence of someone or something interfering in this battlefield, within the very space that Peliod controlled.

*It can't be?! There are only a handful of people who can enter here.*

Even among the powerful entities who were informed of the situation beforehand, it was difficult to enter this controlled space from the outside. Even if they interfered with space-time through offensive measures like Milim, it would have taken much more time after the anomaly was sensed in the 'Barrier'.
And yet, this person appeared in this space as if there were no obstacles.
There shouldn't have been anyone capable of such a thing.
If there were, it was something higher than a mundane life form.

Peliod located the coordinates of the person's appearance and fixed her gaze upon it.
And there she saw a golden glow.
The glint was coming from the barrel of a gun, and the muzzle of that gun was pointed at Peliod herself. The person who was holding the gun was the Yellow Primordial, who had been left alone, thinking that she could no longer do anything.
The target was close to the Yellow Primordial, her eyes were sharply fixed on Peliod's head.
It was clear what she was going to do.
And it was threatening enough to make Peliod shudder.

"Stoooop!!"

Faster than she could speak, a bullet shattered Peliod's head.
And without exception, the very existence of her life was reaped.
Thus, Peliod was extinguished without even a moment to leave a word of farewell.


![soft scene break]


Zelanus sensed that Peliod has disappeared.
Her existence was gone---in other words, she was dead.
It was a grave situation.

"It's time," Zelanus muttered to himself, deciding to withdraw.

"Hm?" Milim was suspicious.

"I told you that further fighting is pointless."

Peliod's death was unexpected for Zelanus. It was to the extent that future plans were thrown into chaos, and he could no longer be concerned with the immediate victory.
Even if he continued to fight Milim, it was 50-50 whether Zelanus would win or not. The reason why Zelanus had still decided to fight was that Peliod was planning to kill all the enemy generals, collect their power, and use it to support Zelanus.

If Peliod herself could be 'Life Reconstructed' by integrating the power of the warriors here, she would be reborn as a super-enhanced being, though not as powerful as Zelanus.
However, that plan had fallen through.
As it was, he found himself in a battle that he was not even sure he could win. Zelanus was not optimistic enough to tolerate such uncertainty.
Besides, there was an even greater concern.

This battlefield was covered by a complex of 'Barriers' with the purpose of reducing the damage to the planet. Yet, the overall strength of the 'Barrier' had been weakened by the death of Peliod, who had been a part of it.
Just as Milim was holding back her power, Zelanus, too, had yet to show his full potential. He also judged that further continuation of the battle might cause unforeseen problems.

"Are you running away?"

"Ridiculous," Zelanus sneered at Milim's provocation.
Milim was no fool, and she understood that she would not be able to give her best if the 'Barrier' was lost. That is why she had planned a short battle, and since the battle could not be won, there was no longer a reason to keep Zelanus in this position.
It was true that Milim was hiding her power.

She did not use all the power she had in her body to the extent that, when using it, she even felt that defeating Zelanus would not be difficult.
However, the problem was what would follow.
Once Milim's power was released, it was difficult to stop it because after it exceeded the limit, Milim lost all reason and would enter a rampaging state.
Milim's 'Stampede', as Frey once told Clayman, really existed. Milim had told her so casually that Frey did not think it was real, but it was indeed a true story.
Milim thought to herself.

*My friends are also exhausted and some of them are even in danger if they are not treated soon enough. It's better to make a fresh start rather than to forcefully finish him off.*

That was Milim's conclusion.
Therefore, Milim decided to let Zelanus go.


![soft scene break]


Carrera confirmed Peliod's disappearance and smiled happily.

"Fufufu, look at that. We won."

Carrera turned around to say that, but Kondou was nowhere to be seen.
Kondou had not been formally summoned by Masayuki's ability. He had only forcibly manifested using the Golden Gun that he had given to Carrera as a medium. It was an existence that made sense of an illusion created by Carrera's desire.

"Heh, I understand. You came here because you were worried that I wasn't good enough, right?"

Carrera spoke to the empty sky with a smile on her face. It was lonely, but Carrera was strong enough to bear it. That's why she was determined to become stronger so that she wouldn't have to make the same mistake next time.

![break]

Gobta was raising his battle cry of victory.
Ranga was howling in triumph as well.
It was funny how surprisingly similar they were to each other.
Geld collapsed in exhaustion and Obera helped him up as if to congratulate him on a good fight.
Karion and Frey were nodding to each other, lending a hand to Obera and laughing with Geld.
Gabil and the others rushed in to help Geld on a stretcher and sprinkle him with recovery medicine. He seemed to be in good health, despite all the fuss.
As Geld and the others were carried away to Tempest, Midley murmured with emotion.

"We won."

"Ah, Midley-san."

"Fufu, I feel embarrassed to be addressed with '-san' by a primordial, who has lived longer than myself."

"Well, that's all right. I, for one, pay respect to those whom I recognize."

"I'm honored."

The conversation stopped there, and the two basked in the afterglow of their victory for a few moments.
With so many wounded, it was hard to call it a complete victory. However, no one was killed. Carrera was satisfied with that alone.
As far as this battlefield was concerned, she had given strict orders to her demons to recover the souls of the dead, so they were able to deal with this scale of damage. Even so, if it had been hit by a powerful wide-range attack like Obera's devastating technique, the casualties would have been irreversible.
The fact that they could all rejoice together in this way was no doubt a great victory.

"I will get stronger."

"Hm. The legendary demons I was told about were portrayed as monsters that didn't understand the human mind... But when we're actually talking to each other like this, I surprisingly find that we can get along."

"It's a bit late for that, isn't it?" Carrera laughed at Midley's frankness.
Seeing Carrera like that, Midley smiled at her.

"If you are aiming for strength, then I won't lose either. If my body is about to give out after just that amount of exertion, then I am still lacking in kung fu."

"Ahaha. You're pretty good at it, but you still intend to train even harder than that."

"Isn't it natural? I have to push my mind and body to the limit so that I can give it my all for a longer period of time. Carrera-dono would be a good opponent for me, don't you think?"

"That's a good idea. I've been thinking of training more with the body that was entrusted to me by His Lordship. I'm willing to take you up on your offer."

Carrera and Midley shook hands firmly.
Since they both had the same goal of aiming higher, there was no reason to refuse.
Milim joined the conversation in her usual manner.

"That's not fair! That special training, I'm gonna join too!!"

Milim was very happy and nonchalant about the situation.

"Hey, hey, does Milim really need to get any stronger?"

"Mm. Milim-sama is the strongest, so she has no need for any special training, right?"

Carrera was no slouch either, but there was always someone better. It was a well-known fact that Milim was out of the norm, and Carrera, who had come here and interacted with Milim, understood that fact to the point of disgust.
Even so, Carrera was still one of the better ones and could respond to most of the crazy requests with a smile, but that was not the case with Midley. Unlike Carrera, Midley tried to be very serious and reserved.
However, Milim did not get the message.

"Wahahaha! What are you saying? I won't allow you to exclude me from the fun!"

And so, she forcefully decided to participate.

Gobta read the situation correctly here.
He sensed the danger.
Gobta saw Milim descending from the sky and had been secretly listening to her. He sensed something disturbing in the flow of the conversation.
If things went on like this, he would likely be forced to participate, so he decided to make a strategic retreat.
It was an excellent judgment of the situation.

"Well, I'm off to report my victory!"

And then, hopping onto Ranga, the two now split, he fled the scene like the wind.
The combination of Gobta's constant attention to his surroundings, and his willingness to absorb any useful information, had saved his life.
Ranga trusted Gobta.
His ability to foresee danger had helped him many times, so he followed Gobta's lead without any doubts. As a result, Ranga also succeeded in escaping.
As for the others...

"Nn? Uh, h-hey..."

"Hold on Milim, you can't possibly be planning to drag me into this too, right?"

Not only Midley and Carrera, who were the first to be caught, but also Karion and Frey were forced to join against their will.
Thus, although the war in this region had caused a great deal of destruction, it had come to an end without any fatal damage---or so they thought.

![break]

"Blizzard, let all things be frozen over and put to sleep."

![break]

As if aiming for the moment when everyone was caught off guard, the world was dyed white. A blizzard of despair swirled from the outer edges of the battlefield to the center, encircling everyone so that no one could escape.

"It can't be, you---"

Milim was the first to notice, but by then it was already too late.
She was completely caught off guard.
There weren't many people who could fool a demon lord as ancient as Milim.
However, it was not an impossible feat for the eldest sister of the True Dragons, Frost Dragon Velzard.

"It's been a long time, Milim."

"What are you doing, Velzard?"

"Fufu, I came here to see my lovely niece. I need your help with something."

"Don't look down on me. If you're going to ask me for a favor, you'd better behave appropriately. Get rid of that blizzard first and then I'll talk to you about it!"

Milim intimidated Velzard while holding back her anger.
If things continued this way, her friends would be in danger.
In fact, those on the outer edge had already been frozen and turned into ice sculptures. They were not dead, but even their vital activities had ceased.
It might sound good to hear that they were in a state of suspended animation, but their lives could be destroyed by Velzard's will alone.
Milim understood this.

She was caught completely off guard, aiming for the moment she relaxed right after the deadly battle with Zelanus.
Frey felt an even greater sense of danger than Milim.
If Milim were to become enraged and lose control, this entire area would be burnt to ashes. If that were to happen, the scale of the damage would be unimaginable, and it was uncertain how many people would survive.

*I have to make a decision...*

Frey decided that it would be dangerous for Milim to let Velzard do as she pleased.
Most likely, the longer she delayed, the worse the situation would become. Thinking as such, Frey transmitted an order to the Soaring Flock without Milim's approval.

<Take out Velzard!!>

With that voice as a signal, the Soaring Flock moved out at once.
There was no person who did not understand the terror of Velzard. Everyone was prepared to die in this suicide attack.
Milim, their beloved master, was kind to the point of fatality. The more people who fell asleep as ice sculptures, the more Milim's patience would reach its limit.
Once that happened, there was no turning back.

Even now, she was forced to endure out of consideration for Frey and her other friends. If the situation worsened any further, she would have no choice but to follow Velzard's lead for fear of sacrifices.
To Frey's knowledge, the only time Milim had ever fought seriously was when she clashed with Guy and destroyed the country, long before Frey was born.
If Milim fought seriously with the intention of killing her opponent without regard to the cost to her allies, she would never have a hard time no matter who the opponent was. And yet, Milim never once fought seriously.
In other words, they were Milim's shackles.

Because Milim was so kind, Frey acted so that they would not be a burden to her.

"Tch, we were late. You guys can run away if you want to, but if you're going to stay, you'd better be prepared."

"One crisis after another. Moreover, this time it's with the aunt of our lord. I hate a battle that can't be won, but if it's for Milim-sama's sake, I can't complain about it."

Karion made his announcement, and Midley followed him with a laugh.
Of course, no one from the Winged Beast Knights left.
The warrior priests led by Hermes had also abandoned their roles as medics and switched to battle mode.
Thus, Milim's subordinates rushed to Velzard all at once.

"Y-you guys, stop! Hurry and get the hell out of there!!"

As if to drown out Milim's screams, a havoc of magic and spirit bullets were concentrated on Velzard.

"Milim-sama is loved. Me as well, I wish I could have served you earlier..." Obera murmured.

She was exhausted from the battle with Peliod, and her energy was running low. Even so, Obera stood up again and firmly fixed her gaze on Velzard.
Velzard was an absolute force to be reckoned with.
Frankly speaking, the probability of winning was zero.

Frey could not have been unaware of this, and if she had only wanted to survive, she would have ordered the army to "disperse and leave this place."
The reason why she did not do so was probably because---

*Fufu, she's a cunning one, isn't she? I didn't dislike her in the first place, but her decisiveness is deserving of respect.*

Frey's aim was to get Milim to abandon her doubts.
If they were killed by Velzard, Milim would no longer have a reason to hesitate. Frey made the quick decision that if Milim survived, that was all that mattered.
Karion and Midley followed suit.
Their subordinates also made the choice to share their fate without any hesitation.
They all loved Milim.
Obera was the same way, so she could understand their feelings. She respected those who had made the same decision as the subordinates she had lost, and she too was prepared to die here.

Carrera, who remained in this land, was also thinking about what she should do in this situation.
An endurance match against the flawless Velzard was impossible.
Velzard was not as gentle as Velgrynd.
There was no way for Carrera to win against Velzard, and whether or not she could escape from this place depended on her luck.
However, fleeing was not an option to Carrera.

*It can't be helped. If I'm not careful, I'll be disobeying His Lordship's orders, but I should probably go along with them here. Velzard-sama is lacking nothing as an opponent. Let's do my best to struggle!*

And so, she made a quick decision.
It was as good as a disaster for Carrera's subordinates, but none of them could escape from this place anyway.
Victory over Velzard was the only way out.
However, everyone understood that this would never happen.
Therefore, the only thing Carrera and the others could do was to lead all the souls of the dead who would emerge from this place and keep them away from true death.

![break]

"Get fired up, guys. Make sure you don't miss a single one."

Carrera's words were met with a collective nod of approval from her subordinates.
At this point, there was no more time for recovery. The demons gave up their incarnated bodies and returned to their original states as spiritual lifeforms.
Although their influence on the material world would be reduced, it was more rational for them to lead the dead.
Thus, in a very short time, everyone was ready.
But the next moment...

![break]

*How foolish.*

![break]

That cold and heartless intent reverberated throughout the minds of all those present on the battlefield.
It was a quiet voice that was drowned out by the blizzard, yet it carried a very loud wave of thought.
Perhaps in response to the voice, the blizzard turned into a raging blizzard, whiting out the battlefield.
It was unreasonable violence.
A supernatural disaster of such an unimaginable scale had appeared on the battlefield that the concept of resistance was laughable.


![full page image](image6.jpg){Velzard holding an ice crystal: Do you wanna build a snowman?}


![soft scene break]


*Now, go to sleep.*

![break]

The pure white ice and snow raged on.
The soldiers were the first to be transformed into ice sculptures.
Then came the captains, and even the top brass.
Only a few were left. Those who had reached the Million-class level remained.
But it was only a matter of time...

Witnessing the hopelessness of the situation, Frey prepared for her own death.
The same went for Karion and Midley.
The only reason they were still standing was because Milim was protecting them.
If not for that, Frey and the others would have been overwhelmed by the energy that Velzard had unleashed long ago.

As proof of this, Carrera, who was a little further away from Milim, was unable to even shed her body and was left immobile.
Carrera, the pillar of demons, was in that state. Her subordinates were no different.

And of course, Frey's Soaring Flock, Karion's Winged Beast Knights, and Midley's band of priests and priestesses had all been turned to ice sculptures.

Velzard had not even attacked them.
This blizzard was nothing more than a release of her haki. For those who understood it, this phenomenon was an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness.
Milim, who was protecting Frey and the others, was unable to move.
If Milim abandoned them, then their fate would be sealed.

*Ahh, kind Milim. You truly are a sweetheart. I love you.*

Frey thought so sincerely.
She suddenly felt eyes on her and turned her attention to see Karion smiling grinning fearlessly.
Midley let out a big sigh and nodded his head with Karion.
Obera was praying silently.

*I'm sorry, everyone,* she seemed to be apologizing to someone.
It was the very image of those who had made up their minds.

<I guess you've made up your minds.>

<Yeah. Let's do it with all at once, as flashy as possible.>

<Mm. If we're going to fall anyway, let's give Milim-sama one last glimpse of our heroism.>

<Fufufu. Now I finally understand how my subordinates felt. So that's it. They didn't die in vain. In that case, I'll have to bring them something to brag about, too.>

The Four Heavenly Kings under Milim were united in that moment. And...

"Wait, you guys?!"

They took action before Milim could stop them.
The coordination between the four of them was nothing short of brilliant.
As if they had been warriors for a thousand years, they approached Velzard with a series of unerring, instantaneous attacks.
But alas, all of that did nothing.

"I'm glad, really. Because you guys were as strong as I expected you to be, I was able to deal with you without any mishaps."

Velzard smiled and remained standing there coldly.
In front of her, four new ice sculptures were born.
At the same time, Milim's expression froze.
It was an expression in which all the other emotions had fallen away, leaving only one.
In other words, a look of rage.
Milim was furious that her friends were taken away from her.

![break]

"I won't forgive you. Taking away my friends? I will never forgive you!!"

![break]

Milim's cry pierced the battlefield.
At the same time, Milim's Skill, the Ultimate Skill 'Wrath King Satanael', began to operate at full power. Taking in the surrounding magicules and pouring in all of her own mana, it continued to generate even greater power.

Fueled by rage and the magicules emanating from Milim, it was the ultimate power to propagate magicules. The 'magicule breeder reactor' was so powerful that it could not be mastered, and was the essence of the Ultimate Skill 'Wrath King Satanael'.

The magicules that were used as fuel were returned as more power.
They were literally breeding.
As long as this was activated, the amount of magicules in Milim would continue to increase rapidly. Moreover, no matter how much she consumed, they would never decrease, which was the ultimate power.
Veldanava's offspring, the title of the Dragon Princess was not an exaggeration.
The sole individual who wielded infinite power---that was demon lord Milim.

And again, Milim roared loudly.
At that moment, the heavens trembled and the earth shattered.
The mythical-grade armor enveloping Milim's body changed ominously, as if responding to her passion. It was not a measure to protect Milim from external enemies, but rather a measure to prevent her from being defeated by her own internal power.

The overflowing torrent of power fused with the armor, transformed it, and covered Milim's entire body. Milim's transformation was complete.
Upon her back were a pair of jet-black wings. A single red horn sprouted from her forehead, shining in iridescent colors. The rest of her bare skin was covered with hard, shining dragon scales with mysterious patterns and dull, shifting colors.
This was Milim's true form.
This was the true form of the Dragon Princess, who, despite her human body, possessed a power that surpassed even that of the True Dragons and manifested as the embodiment of absolute destruction.

"Ara ara, this is the second time I've seen you like this. Since we're already here, why don't I play with you a little?"

"Die."

There was no one left to stop Milim.
Heaven and earth rumbled with the fury of the ancient demon lord.
Immediately thereafter...

The world would once again be exposed to the wrath of the ultimate dragon majin.

![full page image](image7.png){A sketch of Milim in battle-mode: ngl, she kinda looks like she's cosplaying as a dragon.}
