# Epilogue: New Bonds

The location is the holy land---"Inner Sanctum".

The head of the "Seven Luminary Clerics", "Master of Sun" Gran, is done with his work for now and has been bitterly waiting for his companions to return.

There seemed to be changes to the plan for eliminating Hinata. The Master of Fire sent out an urgent call for help. There was no room for failure regarding this particular matter. That's why he sent out the Master of Moon and Gold together to fight.

*That woman is too smart. She would continue to be an obstacle for my plans if I don't manage to eliminate her today. The Goddess Luminas---No, I'll manipulate that Demon Lord to become the true ruler---*

The Master of Sun has hidden his ambitions and served Luminas for thousands of years.

He eliminated dangerous newcomers who were overly talented before they could make a name for themselves.

He has also manipulated his colleagues and subordinates, who are the members of the Seven Luminaries, through cunning words. The Master of Sun continued to play the role as a devoted believer.

It is very easy to motivate them.

Some of them desires Luminas's love. So as long as he invoked jealousy among the other members, they would dance to the tune of the Master of Sun.

This time was no different. They still followed the will of the Master of Sun...

The Master of Fire has disguised himself as the Holy Knight Garde, who was secretly disposed of. He has set off to assassinate Hinata.

Everything has been perfectly planned out.

The Master of Moon has disguised him with illusional magic, so he won't be exposed.

The Dragon Buster that was handed to Hinata has been tampered with and can be destroyed at any point of time. Combining the attack of Demon Lord Rimuru and the destruction of the holy sword, Hinata would most definitely be defeated.

Yet Hinata didn't use the Dragon Buster, and she even prevailed in her duel with the Demon Lord.

Gran has decided to change the specifics of his plan upon hearing this news.

It would be best if Demon Lord Rimuru takes care of Hinata. But if he fails, the Master of Fire would then make sure Hinata is eliminated.

They would then eliminate all the witnesses in the name of the Seven Luminaries to appease Demon Lord Rimuru.

They would change their plan to win the trust of Rimuru instead in order to get on good terms with him.

But then, more problems kept emerging.

There was also a situation in the Nedler territory within the Kingdom of Farmus. The demon there was both powerful and cunning beyond measure.

He flaunted his power---Such a reckless tactic was successful in raising doubts among the journalists of the surrounding nations that they had gathered.

When Gran heard the report sent back by the Master of Earth, he immediately sent the Master of Water and Master of Wood as backup.

Considering how things had developed, they had to take out all the witnesses and frame the crime on that Demon.^[Sierra: Wow Farmus really is garbage]

*We shall march in the name of God on the Demon who has committed such heinous crimes*---With this saying, the actions of the "Seven Luminary Clerics" would be justified.

In other words, they would hold the Demon accountable for his reckless actions instead of holding Demon Lord Rimuru responsible. That's the direction they planned to head towards.

If there is any difficulty in negotiation, they would use the name of goddess Luminas as justification. Demon Lord Rimuru wants to build his foundation among the Western Nations, so surely it will be troublesome if he's labeled as the "Nemesis of God". Then there will be more space for negotiation.

The Master of Sun believed the plan would no doubt be successful with such reasoning.

But if there is any problem, it would be that Demon---Diablo is absurdly powerful...

But with the aid of the Master of Wood, whose power is only next to himself^[Sierra: Ah, yes. Im certain Wood is almost as good as The Sun. Right? Right?!]---The Master of Sun has no doubt that they will emerge victorious.

Yet his colleagues still have not returned.

"What have those guys been up to---"

Such a complaint came out of his mouth unconsciously.

There shouldn't be anyone present to respond to him, and yet he heard someone respond back.

"What is wrong? You seem rather impetuous."

"You... What are you doing here---?"

The Master of Sun asked while hiding his surprise.

The uninvited guest is Hinata's trusted subordinate---Cardinal Nicolaus Speltus.

"Well, I found something very interesting."

"You found something?"

"Indeed. Here it is."

As he finished, Nicolaus took out the crystal ball containing the memos from Rimuru.

"How is that interesting---?"

"I found out that someone has tampered with it."

Nicolaus added on while interrupting Gran.

It was quite rude, especially when done towards a legendary heroic figure, such as himself. Yet Nicolaus doesn't seem to care one bit.

Even though he was displeased, Gran looks towards the crystal ball.

The deleted content suddenly reappeared, showing the real message.

"---Ah!"

Nicolaus continues to sense Gran's distress:

"I have no interest in your goals, whether you want to be pets of God Luminas or you wish to manipulate the power of God..."

"What are you saying?! God is a concept that lives in people's heart."

"There is no need to hide it any longer. I realized a long time ago that God Luminas indeed exists. I simply followed in Hinata-sama's footsteps and concealed that fact. Apart from that, I have no interest on the matter---"

Master of Sun can almost hear Nicolaus adding the line "Including the fact that you wanted to use the name of god---"

He opens his eyes wide at Nicolaus.

Nicolaus on the other hand, looks back at the Master of Sun with his face of wisdom, staring closely at him. His eyes are like a bottomless swamp, filled with schemes but not a sense of emotion.

"You---"

Gran wants to say something, yet Nicolaus wouldn't allow him to finish.

"Go to hell, you old crooks. "Disintegration" !"

"How---!"

How could you---Those are the words he probably wished to utter. The frame of his shocked face is printed as the Master of Sun is devoured by light particles and annihilated.

"Foul pest. Did you expect me to let you walk free after trying to do harm to Hinata-sama?"

Leaving these words, Nicolaus returns to his office as if nothing has happened.

Cardinal Nicolaus Speltus---Hinata's trusted subordinate and her fanatic follower.

To him, religion is but his way of tagging himself alongside Hinata.

Nicolaus is a heretic.

He stands at the top position of the Pope's Ministry, yet he does not believe in god.

He only believes in one person, Hinata.

![soft scene break]

The heat of the fireplace has kept this room warm.

Sitting on a thick and soft chair, Granbell Rosso is meditating.

"Nicolaus... You little shit..."

He mumbles to himself as he opens his eyes.

The bright lights of "Disintegration" is still branded in his brain.

Indeed, the true identity of Granbell Rosso is the head of "Seven Luminary Clerics" --- "Master of Sun" Gran.

Granbell possesses the ability to separate his astral body in order to possess others, His heart is filled with anger now that his recently renewed body has been destroyed by Nicolaus.

Moreover, had it been him there in person---He can't deny that it would have been a really close call.

This furthers Granbell's anger.

It is time to withdraw now.

When he opened up his eyes, he sensed that Glenda was approaching the mansion as well.

That should indicate something has occurred outside of their plan, in other words, the mission has failed.

Glenda bashes into the room and starts shouting upon seeing Granbell.

"Granbell-sama, I can't win against that. I can't handle that insane monster that showed up!"

He can tell that she has given everything she had to escape as she has exhaustion written all over her face. Her words are no doubt truthful.

"What happened to the rest of the "Three Martial Sages" ? If you three all move in together---"

"No way, our enemy isn't that weak. I have a keen sense to the aura of death on the battlefield. I realized things weren't good for us, so I escaped after leaving the fighting to Sare. The enemy could rival Demon Lord---No, he was probably even stronger..."

These are Glenda's testimonies.

*You are overreacting*---Granbell thinks to himself, yet the rest of his colleagues within the "Seven Luminary Clerics" has yet to reach out to him as well.

Granbell, unease at the thought begins to detect their presence, yet he is not receiving any reaction.

"Could it be..."

This is the reality that cannot be averted even with Granbell's shocking realization.

A few days later---

As spies across the nations report back to Granbell, he was informed of the defeat of King Edward.

The reporters from all over the nations were safe and sound. They've spread out and made the headlines to notify every member of the public about the whole thing.

What follows is rumor from the Kingdom of Blumund that the Tempest Federation is planning to host a grand celebration.

Assessing all the information, Granbell finally determines his operation to be a failure.

Including himself, the "Seven Luminary Clerics" have been completely annihilated.

Now he can't keep acting with the false name of the god Luminas.

Later, his beloved Mariabell also made a prediction---

"Dangerous, Dangerous indeed. That town is very dangerous!"

Not knowing what she meant, Granbell asked:

"Do you mean that the angels are attacking?"

"No, that's not the case, grandpa. That Demon Lord is planning to dominate the world through economy."

The manipulation of human world through economy---That is the ardent hope of the Rosso.

It is also the plan that Granbell has been working on.

"How could this be..."

"It's true. And it will become a reality eventually. That's why---We have to defeat him before that."

Mariabell wouldn't lie.

---She hasn't lied to this day.

That's why he needed to refer to her words as part of the assessment as well.

"I see, if you say so, it must really be the case."

After all, Mariabell is from Granbell's direct lineage---

"Indeed. Next time, we will be able to do it next time. I shall gamble on my name, Mariabell the "Greed" !"

---She is also a reincarnated one.

Having possessed extraordinary power and knowledge from the "Otherworld", she is the hope of the Rosso.

With Mariabell, the Rosso will always have the upper edge---With that thought in mind, Granbell's ambition is ignited once more...

![hard scene break]

After all the fuss that had gone done, I was able to reach a peaceful resolution with Luminas.

I was also able to resolve the misunderstanding between me and Hinata.

In return as apology, they promised me that they would announce to the world under the name of Western Holy Church that we are harmless monsters.

And the previous conflicts have been due to challenges in communication.

There may be similar problems like this in the future, but I will learn from this incident to overcome any future challenges.

As such, our diplomatic relation with the Holy Empire of Lubelius has also been revised.

We've signed a treaty of non-aggression and have reached common ground to permit each other's actions.

But someone (Veldora) has caused other trouble, which would be accounted for as a separate case.

I am very firm on my position that the problem with that person (Veldora) has nothing to do with our country.

Luminas seemed unpleased, but she had to agree after I promised to not intervene with anything related to the treatment of that person.

---But it won't really matter, since with the Ultimate Skill 'Storm King Veldora', Veldora, to some extent has become immortal. There shouldn't be a problem if anything bad happens to him.

<<Answer. There wouldn't be a problem.>>

Hmm.

I seem to feel a sense of guilt for selling out my friend, but with that being said, we still need to sacrifice brother Veldora to contain Luminas's wrath.

"UHHH, are you leaving me to die now---?"

Someone seems to be shouting at the top of his lung, but I must be hearing things.

At the end of the day, he had it coming, so I can't really help with that.

It may be saddening, but that's how you mature in leading a life.

Just like that, on the bedrock of a tiny sacrifice, we embrace the time of peace.

I'm not sure what happened in between to have things come to this point, but Youm's seat as king has also been settled.

Now all we have to do is to wait for inauguration, how wonderful it is that things have worked out fine.

With all that being said, our problems have been resolved altogether.

From today onward---

The Western Nations have officially accepted us.
