# Chapter 3: A Saint's|Goal

On this day, the world is shadowed in fear once more.

"Storm Dragon" Veldora has been revived.

The Western Holy Church has announced the fact to the public.

And just before their announcement, they received information from the Freedom Association with regards to a message from the Demon Lords.

With the news of the Ten Great Demon Lords becoming the "Octagram", nations around the world have plunged into chaos.

Every ruler of the nations has been troubled over the drastic change of situation and are all concerned about what to do in response.

The whole world has been shaken.

The Western Holy Church is of no exception. They have detected an unusual aura of danger.

It's been several days since the duel between Hinata Sakaguchi and Rimuru. The Church has been unable to reach Archbishop Reyhiem since his march alongside the Farmus Army. It is an established rule to always send regular reports back, yet he has not responded, meaning something has gone wrong with their march on Tempest Federation. When she received the news, Hinata decided to head to Tempest Federation herself. Yet, before she could leave, she received the divine order to stand guard at the Holy Church.

The reason was: the revival of "Storm Dragon" Veldora. She was barred from marching as she was left to wait for the gathering of the Holy Knight Order to rain destruction on the Tempest Federation in her stead.

It's hard to tell who's luckier in this situation...

Hinata most certainly would be defeated if confronting Veldora directly without preparation. But now that Hinata is aware of Veldora's revival, she can strategize a direct invasion of the Tempest Federation. A Tempest Federation without Rimuru would have long been annihilated. Hinata's goal is Tempest Federation alone, not Veldora. She could have easily achieved this using her powers.

She was the one with the upper hand.

---But that is not considering Veldora's recent activities and the reaction of Rimuru.

In other words, she was able to avoid the worst ending for both sides.

![hard scene break]

Protected within the gentle light of the domed holy barrier lies the Holy Capital.

This barrier is the product of countless years of research and improvement, the highest level of protective barrier. It is able to prevent all forms of enemy invasion and has defended this city for thousands of years---The prayers of the denizens turned into reality.

The barrier even blocks out sunlight and can automatically adjust the brightness of the interior space. There will be more brightness in the morning and less at night. This created a thermostatic environment within the interior, so the temperature is maintained throughout the year.

The city's farmlands are divided into districts where crops from whichever season can be collected at any time.

It is like an idealized arcadia where the citizens will never suffer famine. Every citizen has a job and all the children receive an appropriate level of education. It is a heaven in the mortal realm where everything is appropriately arranged and managed by the law.

This is the capital of Holy Empire of Lubelius^[Rather than Empire, the original name is more akin to "Theocracy"] ---Holy Capital "Ruen".

On the day of the Walpurgis Banquet, Hinata is on her way to the holy church.

The solemn atmosphere is neutralized by the gentle warmth of the sun.

This is a prosperous kingdom.

Here, no one suffers from starvation, nor are there any beggars on the street. Everyone is given an appropriate job or duty, and they fulfill their assigned purpose to the best of their abilities. They rise as the bell rings and rest as the sun falls. The more capable people would guide the less capable ones, and as such, with proper regulation, the citizens are able to enjoy a prosperous life. In the name of God, they have been granted the ideal, equitable society. This holy city is the greatest representation of that.

Hinata observes the expression of a passersby.

Everyone wears a gentle and kind smile.

However, there is something that concerns her.

She always has some doubts whenever she spends time in this city.

In Hinata's eyes, this holy land is no doubt the ideal heaven on earth.

Turning the Western Nations as well as the whole world into a peaceful society without conflict. That was Hinata's ambitious dream.

Hinata hopes for a society where the strong do not prey on the weak.

However, the reality of this world is simply too cruel.

The Kingdom of Ingracia and the Holy Empire of Lubelius have differences of night and day, which often troubles her. By nature, Ingracia, the kingdom of freedom, and Lubelius, who preaches no conflict, are the polar opposites from political structure to ideology; Every aspect of either society contrasts each other greatly.

The biggest difference perhaps is---The expressions on the children.

She can hear the sound of children coming from the educational facility next to the holy church. Several children who seem to be running late for class are heading down the hallway towards the building. The faster child is holding onto the hand of the slower one. This is a common sight that she has seen in this city. Yet even now, she can tell the difference from this to that in Ingracia.

So, what would happen if it was in the Kingdom of Ingracia?

She recalls the scene she witnessed there.

What would it be like?

It would happen in the morning, when the faster children would sprint through the door just before the bell and have triumphant smiles on their face. The slower ones would arrive late to be scolded by the teachers by themselves. And when that happens, the children who are not late would mock at the slower children.

What if they are to run like children in Lubelius with their hands held by each other's?

They would probably all be late and get scolded by the teacher. But of course, you can avoid being late by getting up a little earlier.

That's not really enough to hold as a comparison. It's a rather unimportant incident.

She always ponders on that.

What is really different in that scenario?

Were the faster children not caring enough? No.

There is really nothing wrong with the children to mock their peers who arrived late. They were not doing so to look down on them or ridicule them as fools. After all, the children who arrived late were laughing awkwardly as well. They seemed rather delightful even after being scolded.

So, what is the case in Lubelius?

She looks towards the running children to see the same expressions on everyone else.

A gentle smile---

The same expressions of satisfaction that is seen on every adult; the same expression of someone who has lost their sense of competitiveness and personal identity.

This society is built to create constant happiness, yet there is no sense of freedom. Everyone is equal and given their own responsibilities.

On top of that, equity is upheld for those who are able to help those who are not. The people of this kingdom make the basis of their nation.

"Creating an equal society without conflict", that is Hinata's pursuit in life.

There will no longer be children abandoned by their parents. Everyone will live a happy life in this world.

This is too idealistic to be practical---That's what Hinata thought as well. But when she almost gave up such dream, she saw that Lubelius was the manifestation of the ideal.

Competitiveness will lead to conflict. Yet this society is so well regulated that there is no form of competition at all, the equivalent of Hinata's ideal. And with regards to the form of government Holy Empire of Lubelius has adapted, it is strictly speaking, close to communism. It's the government that leaves the order of all things to "God" in order to assure absolute equality.

God---as represented by the Pope of the Pope's Ministry.

But if there is any weakness to communism, it would be the existence of a ruling class. Its doctrine of equality is built on the inevitable presence of an authority. And once the people high up in the chain of command are corrupted, it becomes hard for the people under their authority to get rid of their rulers. There would be unjust in the distribution of wealth to widen the wealth gap.

In order to make up for such flaws, the government has handed their authority to God. The Pope's Ministry thus acts as the ruling figure to ensure the equality of their citizens. And of course, diplomacy with other nations is also handled by them.

All are equal under God---That is a clever lie. Yet this has been the reality in the Holy Empire of Lubelius for thousands of years.

It is a truly ideal system, but it is only natural.

Since the true identity of the God Luminas is---

Demon Lord---Luminas Valentine.

Luminas Valentine, overlord, and a True Demon Lord.

Her title "Queen of Nightmares" shows her status as the queen of the Kingdom of Darkness.

She is also the only person who has ever defeated Hinata.

![soft scene break]

In the eyes of the Demon Lords, all humans are the same.

To Luminas, having a comprehensive system of managing humans is the same as having one for livestock. Yet her system has managed to create the ideal kingdom.

Vampires do not need to devour the flesh and bones of humans. They only require a small amount of blood and the spirit stored within it to maintain their lives. More advanced vampires do not even need to ingest blood to be immortal.

Whenever their human food-stock are happier, their blood tastes more delicious. And it is for that reason, the humans living in this kingdom are much more prosperous than other places. The only possible issue is when a vampire might inhale too many spirits at once, and as a result, Luminas has such behavior. The lesser vampires would not dare to disobey the Primogenitor Luminas^[The word here is "真祖" which is a term often used in Japanese fiction to describe the original/most ancient vampire. Same to the effect of "Primordial" for demon in slime.], and so they obey the rules of this kingdom wholeheartedly.

The equality in this society far outranks that of any of the Western Nations.

And it's for that reason Hinata believes in the fairness of the Luminism^[The source uses a phrase which essentially consist two words of "Luminas" and "Religion", which I will be referring to "Luminism" here on.] and first joined the Western Holy Church in pursuit of justice. She has devoted herself to spreading this religion and has since treated the doctrines as the words of God. She even became a holy knight who would give a hand to whoever is in need of help to thoroughly practice her justice.

The way of justice held by her mentor, Shizue Izawa, was too slow and gentle. Meanwhile, her fellow countryman, Yuuki Kagurazaka's plan seems too unrealistic to be practical in her eyes. He would only react to events after they occurred, which lacks foresight.

People, by nature, want to overcome challenges through their own efforts, so it's commendable for the Freedom Association to encourage cooperation among humans. Yet their contracts rely on monetary payment to be extant, which cannot be truly fair in Hinata's eyes.

That's why she left her teacher Shizue.

---If you are ever in doubt, come see me for help.

Although Shizue once said so, Hinata has no intention to do so.

Shizue was just being clingy in saying that.

If Hinata is to continue relying on her soft teacher, she will never achieve greatness---She thinks so to herself, apathetically.

.........

......

...

In this world, you can only rely on your own strength.

That's why Hinata wants to become stronger to the point of invincibility.

She no longer wants to lose anything important to her, so she decides to stop valuing things in life. She ceased communicating with others, being solely focused on becoming stronger.

It only took her just one year to become a Holy Knight after joining the Western Holy Church.

It took less than two years for her to take the seat of the commander of the Holy Knight Order. She also started building what would be called the strongest Holy Knight Order in history.

But the higher in rank she climbed within the Church, the clearer she began to see. She was also able to see some of the hidden truths behind the veil of Luminism.

The Pope of Lubelius---His true identity was a vampire named Louis.

More astoundingly, Pope Louis was the twin brother of Demon Lord Roy Valentine.

It was an outrageous act of aggression for the Pope to ally himself with the Demon Lords in order to ensure his authority. It is clearly treating everyone else like fools.

Upon learning of this fact, Hinata was infuriated.

She ventured alone to the "Inner Sanctum" to eliminate Demon Lord Roy and Pope Louis. Yet she was struck with fatal blows as well during the fight and could only lie there alone to await her death.

Her sense of justice became dim.

She could no longer save anyone as her power faded.

She realized that she couldn't save everyone, that one must make a choice to give or take in the acts of kindness.

Everything seemed almost comical and pointless at that point.

*Hehehehe, is this how I end? The weak are weak even at their deathbed. But at least I was able to cleanse some evil---*

But, even if that's the case...

Hinata deeply believed that she had done nothing wrong.

There was nothing to be ashamed about the evil she had removed from this world. She would carry out her belief even without glory or praise.

*That should suffice*; Hinata was satisfied.

Hinata vision has already gone dark where she heard sharp footsteps coming her way. Initially she thought it was an illusion, yet then the sounds were accompanied by a cold voice.

"The noise you made have disturbed even my bedroom. What have you all been doing?"

In front of her was a beautiful girl with dazzling silver hair.

The blue and red from her heterochromatic eyes gave off an eerie and creepy shine. She glanced disdainfully at Hinata and the others who were also lying on the ground.

![exact fit image](image4)

The powerful aura coming from her made the intense battle between Hinata and Louis, Roy seemed like child's play.

*---!*

Hinata at the brink of death was shocked by the sight.

Such abnormal beauty.

It seemed all too far-fetched from the reach of reality.

The young girl had the dominant majesty of a human ruler.

Good or evil all seemed all too insignificant in front of her.

The proof being---

"You two, I will not allow you to leave me and die."

Logically speaking, both Demon Lord Roy and Pope Louis should have been killed by Hinata already, yet they were both resurrected by the young girl's power. It appeared to be some sort of superpower beyond Hinata's understanding.

*It's all over... Everything I've done has been...*

Filled with desperation, Hinata's flame of life was about to burn out---

"You too, human. How could you die with such selfish thoughts. What is justice? Is it really justice to fight evil for the rest of your life? I doubt it. Besides, what I am doing is no evil, so how could someone as insignificant as you make such judgement so hastily? There is no such justice in this world as to fulfill the free will of everyone. It is simply arrogant for you to think you can achieve it on your own. Is it not?"

As her words were caught by Hinata's ears, a warming light fell on her, saving her life.

Hinata was revived without a scar, and the young girl said to her face:

"I'll give you one week. Defeat my trusted lieutenants and you will pass the "Trial of the Seven Luminaries". Only then, shall I fight you seriously."

And so, she said.

Hinata accepted the trial and passed with flying colors.

She was also able to obtain incredible power from her mentors beyond her expectations through her skill "Usurper".

What followed---

She gambled her life to challenge the young girl---Luminas Valentine, and as a result, surrendered to her after defeat.

......

...

...

Hinata is like a sword that would not break even upon defeat, it only becomes more tenacious and powerful---She metamorphoses.

She has become the right hand of god, a holy sword to cut through all obstacles.

To Hinata, Luminas has become the most important thing to her.

With Luminas, there will be a society of justice and fairness. And without her, this order would be derailed. In order to protect her ideal kingdom, a continuous effort and an unshakable resolve are both necessary.

Hinata is also a double-edged sword.

If Luminas is to become an enemy of mankind, Hinata will deliver her judgement with her own hands. Although it is mostly unlikely, she has still made such resolve.

That's why even to this day, she continues training to improve herself.

![soft scene break]

Without her noticing, Hinata has reached her destination. Her now comrade, Pope Louis awaits her.

At her arrival, she receives Louis' shocking news.

"Last night, my brother died."

The night before, Hinata defended the Cathedral from a mysterious invader. She was supposed to meet someone that night, yet by divine order her previous schedule was cancelled. And so Luckily that night ended with the Holy Land undefiled.

At least, it was supposed to be.

"You must be joking, right? Didn't Roy disguise himself as Demon Lord to attend the Walpurgis Banquet?"

"It's true, Hinata. That invader you didn't kill ran into Roy when he returned before Luminas-sama."

"How could this be. The invader ran away as soon as he saw me, that's why I lost him in the end..."

"Indeed, but we can assume it was preemptive. Luminas-sama ordered you to protect the holy land, not to exterminate the invader. That duty was supposed to be carried out by my useless Imperial Guards."

"But I am supposed to be the head of knights among them... But Roy sure is useless having been killed by a cheap-shot like that."

Hinata smiles confidently.

In front of the pope of Lubelius---That is Roy's elder brother.

Luminas Valentine- a True Demon Lord.

Her trusted twin lieutenants are Louis and Roy.

The elder brother takes on the public persona as of Pope of the world, while the younger brother rules over the underworld, acting as a Demon Lord.

And Luminas, who rules over all---as God.

That is the world they are striving for.

It is why Luminas controls things behind the scenes, hidden from the public within the "Inner Sanctum".

Roy possessed the power worthy of Demon Lord title and rightfully became one as a proxy. Upon birth as a vampire, he already had power up to Rank B. His body is highly efficient, with enhanced muscle strength, endurance, reaction speed and other, all several times stronger than an average human. In addition to this, over time he has obtained powerful skills, such as the vampire racial skills: "Immense Strength", "Shadowstep", "Automatic Regeneration", "Paralyze", "Seduce", "Menace", "Transformation", etc.

The members of his race are few in number, but their combat capabilities are much higher than the average Greater majin.

Vampires of high-ranked noble origin that are Louis and Roy have been following Luminas since ancient times. The strength of the two are no joking matter, and Hinata fully understands this. Having once fought them herself, she knows that the strengths of the two are not to be underestimated.

In other words, the invader must have been very strong---At least, that's Hinata's explanation of the incident.

"---But, as long as Luminas-sama is well, there shouldn't be any problem."

Said Hinata before she quietly adds: "But there is no reason to ever be concerned for Luminas-sama---"

Demon Lord Luminas is an entity beyond imagination- the limit of her power unfathomable, even to Hinata. Yet Hinata sees a possibility of confronting her at some point, as Luminas is the supreme being that she ought to aim for as the ultimate target (to surpass). So, it is in fact conceited of her to concern for the safety of Luminas.

Roy on the other hand, to Hinata, is as worthless as a stone by the roadside. It may be unfortunate for Louis, but as far as she is concerned, Roy being killed is completely immaterial.

He died because he was weak.

*It was his own fault*, Hinata thinks to herself.

"The problem may be more severe that you think. To this day we've been having Roy running around to act as a threat in order to convince everyone to convert to the Luminism. With him dead, the humans may become less faithful to our doctrines. In addition, the Jura Great Forest has somehow become safer despite the revival of the evil dragon Veldora."

"You have a point---"

As she answers, Hinata thinks back to that slime she failed to kill. Her failure is likely the reason for this change .

She has nothing to say about that. It was all due to Hinata's miscalculation, and she is aware of that the most. She may have intentionally spared the invader from last night, but Hinata really did plan to eliminate that slime called Rimuru.

*How incredible. It's hard to believe that you actually escaped under those circumstances. I figured you'd be rather cautious, but you far exceeded my expectations, Rimuru---*

Hinata gives her genuine praise to her enemy Rimuru.

"---I'm not sure about the evil dragon, but the forest probably became safer because of the slime called Rimuru. The one I failed to kill."

"Hmm. I did my own investigation too. The army from the Kingdom of Farmus was indeed eliminated. Taking into consideration the time of Veldora's revival, we can conclude that this was also the work of this being called Rimuru. He seems to be quite the problematic foe."

"I first encountered him when he was caught within the Holy Purification Barrier (Holy Field). It was supposed to my best chance to eliminate him."

"Did you go easy on him because he claimed to come from the same place as you?"

"No way. That slime's goal does not align with that of Luminas-sama's. I can understand his ideology, but if we let him be, he will disrupt our plans. That's why I refused to hear him out and decided to destroy that town..."

"The angels will probably strike them next."

"Yeah. Things may be fine now, but at the rate their town is being developed, the angels will definitely move out."

"That's troubling. We aren't prepared yet. I hope we will be absolutely victorious in the next "Tenma Great War" ^[Tenma Great War: war between heaven and monsters.]."

"Right. Those angels: you have to rip them apart to kill them. This advance in schedule would be most troubling to deal with alone."

Louis nods in agreement to Hinata's explanation.

As soon as a city advances to some degree, it will be targeted by the angels for invasion. Their motives are unclear, yet their actions are always the same.

Once the great war takes place, countless innocent civilians will be sacrificed. Hinata has been strengthening the army reservation to prepare for such threat by aiming to decimate the angel army.

At the same time, she promotes the Luminism to unite humanity.

Hinata believes this is the way of advocating the will of the God Luminas. And Rimuru's actions are hindering Hinata's plan.

In addition to her personal grudge against Rimuru after she caught wind of his killing of Shizu Izawa, Hinata has no reason to spare him any mercy. Hinata feels rather bad about involving conscientious, reasonable, and friendly monsters into such conflict, but the holy will of Luminas that declares monsters to be mankind's enemies cannot be defied.

Moreover, the most important thing now is to win the "Tenma Great War". Hinata would do anything so long as it minimizes human casualties.

This is---Hinata, the cruel rationalist.

"But you failed your assassination. However, this may turn out to be quite useful."

"What do you mean?"

"The Western Nations are likely to unite after hearing of a new threat emerging in the Jura Great Forest. Since Roy is dead, haven't they become the suitable candidate as the nemesis of humanity?"

"...Isn't that still up for debate? I doubt things will work out that easily."

*But,* Hinata thought to herself.
It may be a good after all to switch her perspective a little.

If she is able to make peace with the Jura Great Forest and have them coexist with mankind, she'd call that a good outcome in her book. But with that being said, if Rimuru really massacred the Farmus army, he will definitely become an unignorable threat.

However---

"I was supposed to meet that eastern merchant last night. The one who gave me the tip. Had Luminas-sama not ordered me otherwise, I would have been absent last night."

"Oh? Then I suppose it was good timing."

"Indeed, it couldn't have been any better. Those merchants have been trying to manipulate me. Now that I think about it, perhaps it was the right choice to spare Rimuru."

Although it was quite upsetting to have not killed him, Hinata adds.

But he is going to get his beating after sticking his neck out like that lately.

They made it through the Farmus invasion, but the revived "Storm Dragon" would definitely threaten Rimuru.

Moreover, it seems that Rimuru has declared himself a "Demon Lord". As a result, the Ten Great Demon Lords are furious.

And because of that, he was summoned to the Walpurgis Banquet last night.

"That's right. Before we can prepare anything, we better let the Forest buffer the east. That is, if that Rimuru can make through the Walpurgis Banquet."

"You have a point. But would he be able to make through?"

"Rest assured, since Luminas-sama is returning soon. We will see how things worked out then."

"It pains me to think we need to report Roy's death to her."

"She will probably be furious."

"Unlike me, her grace has a very kind heart---"

"Hmm. But according to you, I am not nearly as kind either. I don't feel any sadness even after learning the death of my little brother."

Hinata can only shrug at Louis' response.

The two fell silent, awaiting Luminas's return quietly.

Soon---

"Luminas-sama is back! Quickly kneel!"

Someone rushes to report as the holy church becomes noisy once more.

Soon Hinata and Louis would hear some most unexpected news.

![soft scene break]

They gather in the "Inner Sanctum".

At the center of Holy Empire of Lubelius, the Spirit Hill stands tall and the headquarter of the Saints Church is built on this mountain.

The Holy Church is situated at the back near the Holy Temple, which is also the entrance to the Spirit Hill.

Climbing up the mountain roads, one will arrive at the "Inner Sanctum". It is the most sacred place in all of Holy Empire of Lubelius that cannot be blasphemed. Its supremacy exceeds even that of the Hall of Pope.

Demon Lord Valentine---No, Luminas takes residence there. She is now resting while retelling what happened last night unpleasantly.

"---And all that happened last night, that annoying evil dragon always gives me trouble."

Luminas's bad mood is quite apparent as she lies on the long bench to tell the tale.

It only makes her angrier to hear Hinata's report about the death of Roy.

*Silly child*---

This is Luminas's only comment. As she mutters, there is no emotion in it. She still isn't changing her usual arrogant expression, even in the "Inner Sanctum".

She has been calm all this time as she delivers the message about the Walpurgis Banquet. However, as soon as she mentions that Veldora exposed her true identity, anger crawls its way onto her beautiful face. And as soon as her anger breaks loose, it floods out towards Hinata and Louis.

"How could Roy do this! If he had died somewhere, I could reach, I could have revived him---"

"My brother lived a happy life being under the care of Luminas-sama."

"Hold your tongue! Wouldn't that make me the culprit for letting him die in such way?!"

"That's not the case. It was my brother's fault. Roy failed and thus has betrayed Luminas-sama's expectations."

"But---"

If anything, it was due to his bad luck. It was no one's fault and everyone at the scene is aware of it.

"My apologies. It was my act of sparing the enemy that killed Roy..."

But even with Hinata's admission, Luminas still persists---

"Enough. You were just doing what I ordered. I should be the one to bear the blame. However, we must not immerse ourselves in the grief over Roy's death."

She finishes, switching to a more serious expression.

"Heed this. The evil dragon has been revived, and now there is also the new Demon Lord Rimuru. These are all irrefutable facts and we must plan ahead accordingly."

"Yes ma'am."

"Understood."

Hinata and Louis obeys their orders.

This will soon determine the future of the Holy Empire of Lubelius.

"I shall handle that Veldora in person."

Hinata proposes.

Yet, Luminas's reaction is rather cold.

"Hinata, you've grown stronger. You've come a long way since last I fought against you. Right now, you have already surpassed the "Seven Luminary Clerics" and are catching up to me. However---"

While you may be able to take down Demon Lord Rimuru, but you can't win against Veldora---Luminas asserts.

"That's right, Hinata. That evil dragon is truly powerful. He is the real Rank-Catastrophe threat."

With his many years of experience, Louis agrees with Luminas.

"Is he really that strong? Wasn't he sealed by the "Chosen Hero"?"

Since someone was able to seal him, Hinata believes she can do so as well. Yet, Luminas and Louis reject her this without hesitation.

"Heed this, Hinata. He is the summation of natural energy. You can contain a frenzy storm using magic, but unlike natural phenomenon, that evil dragon has a will of his own. You can't kill him with your sword or magic. In addition, that guy would go on a rampage if you did so, sending shockwaves and highly destructive magic to shatter the earth."

As Luminas speaks, one can easily see her hatred for him.

Louis nods as she continues, his face strained; seemingly recalling some unpleasant memory.

"It was a nightmare. He turned the beautiful Night Palace of Rose (Night Rose) into ruins too horrible to even look at..."

"Stop thinking about it, Louis. That city was the crystallization of the wisdom and technologies of the vampiric race. Now only the memory of it lingers. There is no use in being nostalgic over something that no longer exists."

"You are most right."

After seeing the two's reactions, Hinata finally realizes how dangerous Veldora is.

*---But if things really do go out of control, I would still try.*

Hinata makes up her mind internally.

She also comes to a realization.

The reason why this "Inner Sanctum" was built on the Spirit Hill was to act as defense against Veldora.

---It's a precaution so that the constant surveillance can see him approaching if he does come.

And similarly, the reason why the real capital of Holy Empire of Lubelius---Night Garden---was built underground, it is also to prevent the invasion of the evil dragon.

---It won't sustain much damage even if fights break out.

The enemy Luminas holds such vigilance against is none other than the "Storm Dragon" Veldora.^[This is told from Hinata's perspective since she previously doesn't know]

"Hinata, I don't want to lose you as well. You better behave yourself."

Hinata can only agree given the extent Luminas has gone to convince her.

The thing is, however, her miscalculation during the encounter with Rimuru still troubles her like a bone in the throat even to this day.

It was her misstep to have ignored Rimuru's power just because he was a monster. She doesn't think her actions were wrong judging from the doctrines of the church, but it led to their current situation. Moreover, if she considers that it was all a conspiracy set up by the eastern merchants, Hinata would then have fallen right into their trap.

*Annoying. It's almost like they've seen through us to have released such information. Wait, could there actually be a traitor among us?*

Despite her reluctance to think there's a traitor in their ranks, nonetheless, there may very well be traitors within the Church who have conspired with the eastern merchants. Then it is reasonable to assume that the traitors have also learnt about out preparations to strike against the angels. That's why they've manipulated Hinata into assassinating Rimuru.

This is a sensible theory and it makes it even more likely that there are traitors in their ranks. But she will investigate the matter later. Right now, the issue at hand is---

"Right. But... If that's the case, wouldn't the new Demon Lord Rimuru---"

"Our best solution now is to leave the matter alone. But it's worth celebrating that we haven't declared him as the "Nemesis of God"."

"But..."

"Is there a problem?"

"...Yes. Those monsters are developing their city and constructing roads. These may lead to an earlier assault from the angels."

"Oh yeah, they are still out there. It would be quite annoying to be harassed by a bunch of Phthiraptera (flying lice), but it would be even more troublesome to antagonize Demon Lord Rimuru and "Storm Dragon" Veldora. Besides, the monsters are bigger threats to them, so the angels will probably focus on attacking them. So, there's no use in worrying over it now."

Angels are nothing compared to Luminas. Understanding her thoughts, Hinata complies to her course of actions.

There is however another issue---

"---By the way, Luminas-sama upholds the idea "All monsters are mankind's enemies" ---Yet the existence of their town has completely subverted the doctrines of Luminas..."

Luminas looks troubled at that query.

She ponders for a while.

She won't be able to easily eliminate them at this point of time, yet if not, people may instead lose faith in the church's doctrines for it will lack justification and persuasiveness. And she can't bear to lose her followers now after spending thousands of years fostering her religion.

"Why don't we make him the evil Demon Lord and build a friendly accomplice relationship on that basis?"

Louis suddenly speaks up.

It is the same idea as what he mentioned before to Hinata, about having Roy as the Demon Lord and Louis as the political machine. But just as Hinata has suspected, Luminas rejects the idea.

"No way. That new Demon Lord called Rimuru seems to want to build a kingdom where people can live comfortably. He mentioned that human assistance is necessary for that effort, and so he would protect them himself. He even declared that "Whoever dares to get in my way, whether it is human or Demon lord, will all be my enemies", right in front of all the Demon Lords."

Luminas sighs with melancholy after finishing.

"If only had he not reached out to the humans, we could have just adopted Louis' proposal---"

She adds on angrily.

Hearing so, Hinata suddenly realizes that what Rimuru said about him being a reincarnated one was true.

But it is too late at this point. Hinata knows she has the problem of being too stubborn to listen to others' opinions. Now her flaws have found the worst possible way to haunt her back.

*He doesn't seem to have realized that God Luminas is Demon Lord Valentine. In the worst-case scenario, I will just have to sacrifice myself. Hinata makes such resolves.*

"In other words, we can only quietly observe."

"Hmm, indeed. We should stay put and act natural to the public. It would only make the situation worse if we try to find excuses. We will have to tell the nations the truth that "Storm Dragon" Veldora has been revived."

"What do you plan to do with Demon Lord Rimuru then?"

Hinata begins to ponder while Luminas and Louis also begin to strategize.

"...About that. Rimuru will probably respond to the so-called political consultation, so we should try have the Western Nations cover things up by giving a vague response. Would you agree to that, Hinata?"

It may sound like a question, but Luminas has already made up her mind.

If that's the case, Hinata has no objection.

"All right."

"You sound rather reluctant."

"---A bit, because I still wish I killed him when I have the chance."

"You are right to put it that way. But, that Rimuru is not that dumb as to take such a thing to heart and stand against me."

What she implies is that it won't matter even if Luminas's true identity is exposed.

But Hinata thinks that this is not an appropriate response.

"---I shall take care of the matter."

She hides her truthful response and bids farewell to Luminas.

![soft scene break]

---A month or so later.

Hinata has been working overtime forgoing sleeps.

Not only has she been building a defensive line with the Holy Knights to defend against Veldora, she has also been dispatching members of the Imperial Guards all around the world to collect intelligence. Nowadays, the eastern merchants who once worked as her informants are no longer reliable. Hinata believes that only intelligence collected by her own subordinates have credibility.

The time forwards to the present day. They are about to attend the monthly conference between the two wings serving the Pope.

The participants include the Holy Knight Order that Hinata personally oversees and the Regiment of the Pope's Imperial Guards^[Will be abbreviated as "Pope's Imperial Guards" in future iterations.]---the Imperial Knights that serve the Pope's Ministry.

They are the pride of Holy Empire of Lubelius, two orders of Knights led by Hinata Sakaguchi.

The meeting is being hosted by Hinata.

She is worthy of her status as the strongest knight being both the Head of Knights among the Pope's Imperial Guards and being the commander of the Holy Knight Order.

The table they sit is of U-shape where Hinata takes the head seat. On her right are the six representatives of the Holy Knight Order.

Vice-Commander of the order, Renard Jester.

This Holy Knight with a gentle expression is known as the Noble of Light.

Next to him was Arnaud Bauman of Air.

This man is rumored to be the strongest knight behind to Hinata; known for his outstanding skill as a captain in commanding troops and is the spiritual assault captain of the Holy Knight Order.

Following Arnaud were four other captains: Bacchus of Earth, a large brooding man gifted at smashing his magic-infused Holy Mace into his foes; Ritase of Water, a beautiful healer and spirit wielder who employed the holy water spirit Undine on the battlefield; Garde of Fire, a tall knight and conjurer who wielded his flaming Red Spear, and a serious man who always looked out for his compatriots; and Fritz of Wind, a magical fighter as talented in wind magic as with his twin swords. He was a tactical trickster, a rarity among the high-minded Holy Knights he served alongside. Fritz never wore his uniform up to the prescribed code of perfection, but no one admired and respected Hinata as much as he.

They each lead twenty Holy Knights and form the Five Captains of the Holy Knight Order with Arnaud as their leader. There are only hundred or so members within the Holy Knight Order, and these captains are the strongest among them with unquestionable strength.

In comparison, the regiment on Hinata's left favors individual talents. They are the Pope's Imperial Guards.

There are, in total, thirty-three members, each with different attire and equipment. The reason they only few as thirty-three people is due to the fact that each have strong combat capabilities .

Any of them alone possess enough strength to stand against an entire army. The Pope has even praised them to be "Fortresses"^[The source states "Grant them the title of "Fortress"", but it is more likely to be a metaphor for their strength,] in battle. But it is only natural considering they all possess combat abilities above Rank A. Not only that, several of them united can even stand against a Calamity-Rank threat, making them on par with heroes of this world.

Among them, a few are worthy of mention:

"Vault of Heaven" Sare.

---He takes the appearance of an innocent young boy, yet in reality, is older than everyone at the scene. He has been the head knight in the Imperial Guards since before Hinata's enrollment.

"Boulder" Grigori.

---Sare's right hand man who possesses the ability to harden his body, also known as "Immovable" ^[万物不働 - The source translates more accurately to "cannot be moved by anything".]. His torso is his weapon, whose toughness exceeds that of most metals. He is the type to withstand continuous attacks.

"Turbulent Sea" Glenda.

---A newcomer who arrived even later than Hinata and only made her name in the past few years. She is a wild beauty with eye-catching bottom-curl red hair. She once dirtied her hands in mercenary business and her combat tactics have always been veiled in secrecy. The only person who has actually experienced her true abilities is the ex-Knight Lamar, who she defeated.

The three people known as the "Three Martial Sages" are seated on the opposite side of the six Holy Knights.

All nine people seated here are capable of abilities beyond mortals. The world recognizes them as the opposing forces against "Demon Lords" --- "Saints".

With Hinata, they make up for the Ten Great Saints.

Saints are a high rank species that human can evolve into through many years of rigorous training. People who reach this level are called "Sage". Their lifespan is greatly lengthened and have the ability to transform into a semi-spiritual lifeform. They would be rid of the shackles of the human flesh. And that's why people who reached the level of Sage are able to utilize enormous power. Their immense physical prowess and precision in magical usage has been strengthened far beyond what an average man could foresee, making them powerful beings, able to rival a Demon Lord Seed. They are the guardians of mankind and are slowly evolving into the envoys of God.

With that being said however, they are all nonetheless judged by standards of strength set by humans...

They await Hinata's arrival silently.

Several Holy Knights awaits orders behind their respective captains.

The other members of the regiments have no seat and simply remain standing, waiting for the joint conference to start.

Soon, the heavy gate opens---

"Sorry to keep you all waiting. Let's begin the conference."

As Hinata arrives, the united conference unfolds.

Right behind Hinata, Pope Louis sits behind the royal veil to observe the progress of the united conference.

As soon as the conference begins, Sare immediately lashes out at her:

"Oi oi oi, aren't you rad coming in late. I'd let you slide for not stopping the revival of Veldora, but now you allowed a new Demon Lord to be born. It must be a joke to have cheap-shot like this to represent us, is it not?!"

Hinata may be the Head of Knights, but for many, the knights' obedience doesn't reflect their true opinions.

Sare is the number one among the anti-Hinata crowd since he lost his prestigious status because of her.

For the past month, members of the regiment have been spread all over the land under orders from Hinata. They brought back a lot of information and confirmed the connections between the series of major events that took place.

The birth of Demon Lord Rimuru; The revival of "Storm Dragon" Veldora, and the Walpurgis Banquet, including the recent unrest within the Kingdom of Farmus.

And Sare is implying that all of this happened due to the fact that Hinata antagonized Rimuru.

"That's quite rude of you, Sare-dono."

"Oi, brat. If you have a problem with our commander, how about you go a few rounds with me first?"

Renard retorts coldly with a smile and is backed up by Arnaud.

Someone wants to rebuke this---It's Grigori sitting next to Sare.

"The noble sir knight wants to fight us? Considering your high status, stop mocking opponents who only lose to you on purpose. Don't get so full of yourself." ^[This sentence is somewhat confusing. But I think it's an insult that implies Arnaud can only defeat people who intentionally loses to him due to his high status.]

"What did you say?"

"I see you have a death wish."

The united conference suddenly is a step away from becoming a battlefield. But Hinata calms all of them down.

"How very uninteresting, there is no time for in-fights now. Sare, if you wish to take my place, I can pass you my seat anytime. But before I hand it to you, I'll have to test your strength."

Hinata's words silence the conference room.

It is for the fact that her tone can no longer be described as annoyed, but instead expressing killing intent much more intense than annoyance.

Whoever continues to argue will be executed without question, and that is the absolute judgement from Hinata. The knights are not stupid enough to not realize the message behind her words.

Hinata is usually very calm, and so, in moments like this when she displays her emotions, even Sare know that provoking her now would be dangerous.

"Tsk! Don't you forget about your own words."

Sare glares at Hinata annoyed.

He was once defeated by Hinata.

Normally he wouldn't lose. To Sare at least, there was no way Hinata was better than him.

Yet the result of their fight was a huge flop.

Having experienced his last defeat, Sare won't dare to make a move now. He doesn't have a chance in winning against her, as long as the secret to her power remains unseen by him. It would be a battle he has no chance to win---Which is why Sare obeys Hinata's orders without complaint for now.

After Sare settles down, the united conference can finally commence.

"I have something to report."

As she finishes, "Saint of Water" Ritase stands up and begins her report. She was the one assigned to investigate the Jura Great Forest.

"Jura Great Forest has been peaceful. It has not been affected by the revival of Veldora which is confirmed by the merchants going in and out of the town."

The Tempest Federation is, in fact, often visited by merchants from the Kingdom of Blumund.

The locally produced healing potions are very popular, and apart from that, people also want to purchase their silk products; not to mention their rare monster materials and equipment. That's why the merchants often queue up in the city to purchase the high-quality goods.

"How can that be? Why would they do business with a Demon Lord?"

"And Veldora, it is recorded that he's a warmonger who spreads chaos wherever he goes, yet right now there seems to be no sign that he's up to such business..."

Some begin to raise doubts, only to be hushed as Hinata waves her hand dismissively.

"Finish the report first."

She tells Ritase to continue the report.

"Very well. I shall continue my report. I've learned that the government of the Kingdom of Blumund has declared diplomatic relations with the Tempest Federation from the merchants. They've also been given safe passage for the civilians to travel to Tempest with ease. In addition, the roads to the city has been dazzlingly clean, with not even a trace of horse manure. There weren't any sightings of monsters on the road either, so it would seem the said guarantee of personal safety wasn't just for show."

"Have you explored the location?"

"Yes. In order to confirm things myself, I disguised myself as a merchant to visit the city. There were designated security personnel to maintain order in the streets. The level of development the monster town possesses has exceeded our expectations. And although it had a slightly concentrated magicule content, it wasn't enough to affect human body. It would seem they really do intend to be friendly to humans, just as Demon Lord Rimuru claims."

"---Is that so? What about Veldora?"

"Y-yes, ma'am. About that..."

"What is it?"

"It is forbidden to enter "The Sealed Cave". I wasn't aware any other location for that the evil dragon may prefer to be... So, I wasn't able to find him."

"Hmm."

Hinata hums thoughtfully and acknowledges the end of Ritase's report with a nod after she announced, "That concludes my report".

"There wasn't any sign of Veldora. Perhaps the rumor of his revival is fake news---"

As "Saint of Wind" Fritz opens his mouth to say something, he is stopped by Hinata's cold eyes. It shuts him up immediately.

Ignoring the now panicked and apologetic Fritz, Hinata opens up:

"The divine order is absolute. Anyway, we have now had information on Demon Lord Rimuru's current movements. Next report please."

As she finishes, Hinata wants everyone to report the results of their own investigation as well. Before the conference, she had planned out the necessary information she wishes to learn in this conference.

"---It would seem to be the case that the government of the Kingdom of Ingracia has been relatively settled. When comparing to its usual competitor, the Kingdom of Farmus, who has since fallen from grace, the power of the Kingdom of Ingracia is expected to grow."

The reports proceed in order.

As the knights of the Pope's Imperial Guards, they can freely enter and exit any of the Western Nations.

They may even give orders to the Templar Knight Orders stationed in different nations. In terms of ranking, the captions of the Templar Order are still below them.

In fear of disrupting the chain of command, their home nation (Lubelius) cannot give orders to them without permission from higher authorities. But in case of emergency, the Pope's Imperial Guards can assume direct command the Templar Knight Order.

Given that's the case, their missions did not encounter any obstacles and were successful in gathering intelligence from the neighboring nations.

This is where the Imperial Guards differ from the Holy Knight Order. The Holy Knight Order is also free to visit the nations given its affiliation with the Western Holy Church. But they cannot give orders to the Templar Knight Order. There are also cases of members of the Templar Order joining the Holy Knight Order. One can only explain this as the structural difference between their organizations.

This is why Hinata has decided to use the advantages of each organization when assigning orders for the convenience of gaining more information efficiently.

It is now the last person's turn to report, which is Sare.

"All right, after hearing everyone's report, I have a rough idea of what boss is trying to find. Isn't my part the one you want to know the most?"

"That's right. Of course, I was handed with the most important mission to you. Now do your report."

"I see. Regarding the current situation of the Kingdom of Farmus, King Edmalis of Farmus has stepped down and it seems that the crown has been transferred peacefully. But, the new king, Edward, seems to be recruiting some powerful mercenaries. With him leading, the nobles seem to be doing similar things on their own as well. I think it is likely the precursor of a civil war---"

The news of the birth of Demon Lord Rimuru has spread throughout of the Western Nations. But even if that was the case, the Kingdom of Blumund, who has been communicating with Tempest Federation seems to continue grow more prosperous.

In comparison, the situation in the Kingdom of Farmus seems to be getting chaotic and abnormal.

The nobles are like a plate of scattered sand, and many are acting to preserve their own power. Some are even attempting to reach out to the Western Holy Church and the elders within the Western Council. A civil war seems imminent.

The people of Farmus also seem to have been affected greatly. The price of goods has risen while the commodity flow stagnates (supply doesn't meet demand). Some have been conscripted into the army in order to fill the void of the twenty-thousand soldiers they lost. These newcomers have no combat experience, yet they've been pushed to a desperate spot to have been conscripted.

In other words, these are all signs of civil unrest.

The neighboring small nations have all reacted differently, but they have one thing in common: that is to keep vigilant against the Kingdom of Farmus. Sensing the change in situation, these nations have been tightening security in order to prevent themselves from being affected.

Sooner or later there will be a war---This thought must be on everyone's mind.

"---But this information alone won't be enough to determine Demon Lord Rimuru's involvement."

"I suppose that's true. Anything else?"

"I've screened out the individuals to come into contact with the new King Edward. There have been important figures from the Council, high-ranked officers from the Freedom Association, as well as eastern merchants. He has even attempted to reach out to my subordinates."

"What is his goal? Accumulating military strength?"

"Impressive; you are right with that guess, Miss Head Knight^[The JP directly translate to "Head Knight-sama", maybe too weeb even for my taste.]."

"If that's the case, we can conclude that the new king Edward isn't considering paying the war reparations. No Demon Lord would tolerate such behavior, and I doubt Rimuru is dumb enough to not realize this."

"Oh---Then does this mean that boss thinks all of these are also part of Demon Lord Rimuru's plan?"

"I suppose."

Hinata nods.

*What a timing indeed. All of the intelligence leads to the same conclusion... There's no other way around it, someone is manipulating things behind the scenes.*

Some of her doubts are confirmed as she listens to the report.

Who is behind all this?

There can only be one answer.

Since Demon Lord Clayman who was secretly active among the Western Nations have died, it leaves only one person to be behind such a scheme.

The newly-risen Demon Lord---Rimuru.

*How troublesome. Whether it is his personality (that I can't overlook) or his wisdom in planning out such comprehensive plan. He did mention he was originally Japanese; I suppose that's indeed true...*

Hinata comments on Rimuru calmly.

Now that she recalls all these, all her problems have all been due to her trust in the words of the eastern merchants. Their many years of connection with her has earned them her trust, and she has taken all of their information in, which has been proven to be a fatal mistake. Hinata begins to reflect.

The worst thing is, that most of their information was accurate. The only thing they modified was the portion regarding Rimuru that led to her misunderstanding. These small yet unverified lies have led Hinata astray. Had she believed what Rimuru said then, there may even be changes to how things would play out.

But there is no use saying such thing now.

Hinata then suddenly finds a part of Sare's report to be concerning.

"Speaking of which, Sare, didn't Edward have contact with the eastern merchants? Do you know what they discussed?"

"Why are you suddenly interested in the merchants? Aren't we done with this? We know it was the Demon Lord who's been behind the scenes? Now it's the time to discuss our future plans and how to react to the situation."

"That part of discussion is, of course, necessary, but I am also curious about the merchants. So, quit beating around the bush and answer me."

"Tsk. Weren't those people only in it for the money?"

"No. They lure the unsuspecting into their scheme to profit themselves. Even I was also deceived and manipulated by them before. You all have to be careful in the future as well. So then, what have you learnt?"

"Ho, I suppose they are really something to have manipulated a schemer like you. But, about that... There wasn't something extremely important they discussed. Ah, hold on. Glenda, weren't commercial cities included within your area of investigation? Those places are where the merchants from east and west get in contact; have you got wind of anything interesting?"

Although Sare has a bone to pick with Hinata, he is still very responsible for his work. Then again, Sare has to acknowledge Hinata's strength.

She was able to train knights with poor skills into members of the Holy Knight Order. She had no mercy for monsters while also having her heart devoted to protecting the people.

Somewhere in his heart, Sare does approve of her. That's why he did the investigation, just as she ordered and shared the information he collected. He intends to take Hinata down from her seat, but he doesn't plan to pull the order back by any means.

Sare believes in strength, and for better or worse, his personality reflects how he acts. Hinata is well aware of that as well.

Then, Glenda---

"Well, according to my knowledge, there hasn't been anything suspicious there."

She lies in a thuggish tone.

Glenda has led the life of a mercenary in the underworld and she's seen everything. Her instincts tell her that there is money to make out of the crisis brewing from these events. It is part of her principles to put belief and business as two separate matters.

The public may think that she is a faithful follower of the Luminism, but that's not the case at all. Her real goal is the power wielded by the collective members of the believers of Luminas all over the world.

That can be money, or information, or military force. There may be hundreds of variations, but every one of which is essential to Glenda.

Her status now allows her to freely access all of these, so she can't lose her position. And it is for the same reason that Glenda didn't tell Hinata the truth.

In fact, Glenda did indeed visit the commercial cities Sare mentioned and got in contact with the eastern merchants.

In addition, she even attended a secret meeting with some prominent figures who can be considered elders within the Council.

Her reward was money.

And the contract was to spread false information.

But right now, there's still no time for her to do that as she must wait for the correct opportunity.

That's why Glenda is thinking to herself "It would be bad if Hinata suspects me".

Hinata is cruel and cold-blooded. She wouldn't spare mercy to her enemies. Glenda can't get careless while trying to find a way to trick her.

On the other hand, she's quite nice to her comrades.

It would be a stretch to say comrades, it is more fitting to refer to the followers of Luminas. She probably treats people who believes in the same God as her more like family than comrades.

Glenda has seen through Hinata's personality.

It is for the fact that she is generous when treating her own companions that she allows Sare to constantly confront her.

And it is why that she hasn't discovered Glenda's betrayal.

*Because she treats her own men too good, Hinata will one day fall from grace due to her own personality*---Glenda thinks to herself.

Given this to be the case---

"Since Miss Head Knight cares so much about it, I can go for a more detailed investigation."

"Is that so? Then I'll be relying on you. Please be careful and do not fall for those merchants' words. Understood?"

"Leave it to me. I have my ways. So, I shall get more in-depth information."

Glenda takes on the mission without hesitation in front of Hinata.

She is not self-aware at all, and her casual words have already revealed much to the Hinata...

She sighs internally after having observed Glenda's every move.

*Seriously, I got looked down on. Or could it be that she thinks I'm kind to my companions?*

*If that's the case, she will be sorely disappointed.* Hinata thinks to herself.

Hinata doesn't see any value in companionship at all.

Glenda misjudged that point.

Hinata is only cautious because she considers them as useful pawns to Luminas. And she does so to prevent any damage to Luminas's property.

The Holy Knight Order who has been trained by Hinata to serve as her left and right hands are all faithful followers of Hinata.

You may even call them Hinata's exclusive Knight Order with their absolute loyalty towards her.

In contrast, the members of the Imperial Guards often act on their own. But since they also believe in Luminas, Hinata is thus generous enough to keep an eye closed on their behavior.

Sare is perhaps the best example. His conflict and constant provoking of her are all just acts for everyone else. Sare and Hinata are both aware of that. He may complain, but when it is all business as usual when it comes to work---In some sense, Sare is very easily manipulated.

Besides, Sare is not aware of Luminas.

Not only Sare, everyone except Hinata is unaware of Luminas's existence.

*---How pathetic. They are just as ignorant of the truth like I was before...*

Hinata suddenly thinks.

Glenda is very ambitious.

*With her level of beauty and strength combined, she is very confident in herself. She must believe that she can take me down*, Hinata thinks to herself.

Perhaps she is even planning to win the affection of Louis. It is only natural for her to go after Louis to win his heart not knowing his identity as a vampire.

*Whatever. She can do what she wants, but---*

As soon as she betrays the Church, it would be a different matter.

Hinata won't comment on anything the regiment does under one condition---That they do not act to disadvantage her and Luminas.

However, now that Hinata is suspecting the existence of traitors, Glenda's acts are becoming problematic. But she may have just been manipulated by others, so Hinata doesn't plan to eliminate her immediately.

Anyhow, she can only keep an extra eye on her.

*---Speaking of which, they seem less disciplined these days. I need be stricter during drills to show them their place.*

Hinata feels rather troubled thinking so. But there are more important topics to discuss.

She changes up her mood and says:

"All right, everyone has finished their report. I assume everyone has been updated on the situation."

"Yes. The impact of the revival of "Storm Dragon" Veldora has been much less significant than we predicted. The only known casualties are the Farmus army who engaged in the war. But I think that it was probably a fake rumor released by Demon Lord Rimuru. The actual casualty rate should be zero."

"If that's the case, we will have to question the survivor, Archbishop Reyhiem. We know that Veldora has been revived. So, what happened on that battlefield seems to be more concerning."

As Hinata's adjutant^[Or second-hand to Hinata] Renard says so, Sare follows him up with agreement.

"That's why we should call him in. He should be arriving anytime now---"

Hinata ordered Nicholas to summon Reyhiem. Not only did Reyhiem actually face defeat in battle, he also must have seen Rimuru himself. And so, he is summoned to share his story and thoughts.

In addition---

The dates of Veldora's revival and the defeat of Farmus army seem to only be several days apart from each other. Although all the neighboring nations have been spreading the rumor that Veldora has decimated Farmus army, but in reality, the timeline doesn't come close to align. It is for this reason that the factual testimony from survivor Reyhiem is required.

Reyhiem is scheduled to arrive early this morning, yet he is late.

"I'm looking forward to it. There is no way to tell what kind of story we are going to hear. How exciting."

"Perhaps it will be matters regarding Veldora's revival, he might have some insight into it."

"There has also been rumor that "Demon Lord Rimuru negotiated with Veldora and successfully calmed him down", but it is difficult to verify its authenticity. Veldora has been behaving himself since his revival. If that's true, the credibility of such rumor would also be higher."

"Saint of Air" Arnaud analyzes calmly.

Everyone nods in agreement.

Everyone has come to some level of understanding that Rimuru and "Storm Dragon" Veldora are connected in some way.

Then there shouldn't be any need to hide it. Hinata concludes.

She is referring to what Luminas has mentioned---the fact that Rimuru and Veldora are allies.

"---Indeed, that is true. I have to inform you all beforehand, God Luminas has given the divine order that Demon lord Rimuru is capable of suppressing the "Storm Dragon". For that reason, God said "You shall not take on Demon Lord Rimuru no matter what". I hope everyone will keep that in mind."

"I-If that's the case..."

"I'll be straight with you all then. We are staying low on this incident. We must not confront the Demon Lord directly."

The crowds see Hinata rise up and firmly declare so.

It is to show that they've officially proclaimed to not interfere with Demon Lord Rimuru.

And so, everyone is shocked in response.

"Is it really okay?! Are you telling us to do nothing while Demon Lord Rimuru continues his plotting in the Kingdom of Farmus?"

"Demon Lords are indeed difficult to take on, but aren't those words just for the public? We, the Ten Great Saints, will not lose to a Demon Lord!"

There is truth to Sare's words.

Humans are not completely helpless when confronting S-Rank threat like Demon Lords.

They've long prepared the military force to face the Demon Lords.

People such as the Ten Great Saints, people who've reached the level of "Sage".

Arnaud, Renard and Grigori. The three would stand a chance against a Special Rank A monster.

Among the Ten Saints, Sare is undoubtedly the strongest next to Hinata. He wouldn't do too bad if he fights against a Demon Lord.

*A duel between a Saint and Demon Lord like the legends tell is unlikely to occur. But if it really comes to that, we can have a good fight with our enemies then*, Hinata thought.

They have a rather good chance to win against opponents such as Demon Lord Clayman who's been tempting to make a move in the Western Nations.

However, such judgement can only be made towards the (unawakened) "Demon Lord Seed".

Sare and the rest won't be able to handle a True Demon Lord.

This is the most common of knowledge to Hinata, as she knows the truth about Demon Lord Luminas.

And even Rimuru has also---

It is rumored that large nations such as Farmus have summoned many otherworlders and trained them for battle. Although such acts are largely criticized and prohibited by the public from a humanitarian standpoint, the enemies they fight are still monsters who pose threats to the whole of mankind. It renders such moral judgement uncompelling in the long run.

The Farmus army consists of Head of Court Mages, majin Razen who can repeatedly reincarnate and the now dead Knight Commander Folgen. They were still defeated by Demon Lord Rimuru despite such military might.

In addition to Luminas's account of Rimuru's instant kill of Demon Lord Clayman, it should be clear that the "Ten Great Saints" who only possess the title (of Saint), would not stand a chance against him unless they are truly able to achieve higher evolution to become a real "Saint".

---Like Hinata.

If the opponent right now is Demon Lord Rimuru, any of the nine Great Saints other than Hinata would not stand a chance. If that's the case, they should then prevent unnecessary casualties.

Besides---

"But...by the way... This time, there's also the "Storm Dragon" on top of there being a Demon Lord. The situation may grow more chaotic if we make a move without planning."

Renard's calm analysis is straight to the point---The Tempest Federation has the aid of Veldora.

There is little chance to win even if they throw in all of the military reserves of Lubelius.

"We should just do it! We can't allow our territories to just be taken over by the Demon Lord!"

The conference room quiets down due to Grigori's shout.

His words represent everyone's thoughts at the scene. Their eyes fall onto Hinata.

Yet with an uncaring expression, Hinata simply allows them to gaze.

"The divine order of God cannot be defied. It is not within our power to defy."

"How can it be?! Are we to leave the Kingdom of Farmus to its own demise?!"

"That's not the case, Ritase. There may, at most, be an outbreak of civil war in that kingdom. What we ought to protect are not the royalty or nobles, but the people. We should focus more on preventing the civil war from affecting the citizens of Farmus as well as other states."

"What do you mean?"

"That kingdom may change its leadership, but if we are to intervene, it would be interfering in their internal affairs. Haven't they always been refuting our requests for them to stop summoning otherworlders with the excuse of "interference with internal affairs" ? This will probably play out the same way."

Hinata answers coldly with a smile.

"Then according to you, are we not approving the actions of Demon Lord Rimuru?"

Grigori questions Hinata.

"That's right. Since Demon Lord Rimuru stated that he doesn't wish to antagonize humans, there is no need to continue our hostile approach. Not only did Archbishop Rayhiem's attempt to eliminate Rimuru end in failure, but so did mine as well. There is a high chance of them listing us as their enemies if we continue this way, so we can only allow their actions in the Kingdom of Farmus."

"But that's the misstep of Western Holy Church---Or rather, you. We here in Lubelius didn't mess things up!"

Grigori shouts out.

But Hinata is not moved by it.

Her smile is replaced by a tone of indifference as she answers Grigori:

"You are right. That's why none of you are to make a move. In the worst-case scenario, I would push firmly the stance of Western Holy Church---That is my own final verdict."

She answers quite calmly.

"What!"

"Hinata-sama!"

Hinata gives her order to the Imperial Guards ignoring the astounded Holy Knights. Even Sare seems to panic realizing her resolve.

"Rest assured. In my view, he does not wish to start a war with us."

Hinata said so in hope of comforting the rest, but no one seems to accept this.

"It can't be, how could boss trust the enemy so much?"

"It would be strange for me to say such things before, when not only did I not believe him, I tried to kill him off. But now, I think he is trustworthy. He said to me in person that he was a otherworlder just like me. Although I ignored his words completely then, it seems that he truly is trying to avoid conflict with us."

"Is he really a otherworlder ? Wouldn't that make him the same type of reincarnated majin as Demon Lord Leon who turned from human to a monster?"

"No, according to himself, he seems to have died in his original world to be *reincarnated as a slime*^[Roll credits] in this world."

"Are you kidding me?"

"Sare, shouldn't you know that I hate jokes?"

"Tsk, that would be unprecedented if true. There are indeed cases of reincarnation, but those would only retain the memories of their past life. How can someone cross to another world and get reincarnated at the same time..."

"That would indeed be a first."

Hearing Sare's comment, Renard also gives the same view after recalling.

"But what odds are we talking here, to have been reincarnated as a slime? Right, what would you do if it happens to you?"

Arnaud asks Ritase next to him. He can only see that a shred of annoyance is added to her already distressed face.

"I don't even want to think about it. I wouldn't be able to talk, so human contact would be challenging. And considering the limited vocabulary a slime would have, I wouldn't even properly communicate the message of "I am harmless (not a bad slime)" to others I encounter. After all, most slimes cannot talk at all."

Ritase speaks up on her most sincere thoughts.

You cannot talk and do not have any limbs. Communication is only made harder when you do not know the spoken language or written words used by others.

Upon considering these, everyone begins to feel somewhat sympathetic towards Rimuru.

"I suppose."

"That's true..."

The members of Holy Knight and Imperial Guards agrees with her one by one.

"I originally thought that they were all lies from a monster, but they may turn out to be real. To this day, I feel a little sorry to him."

Hinata is no exception, moreover---

If Rimuru had indeed tried his best to express sincerity, he would likely hold a grudge after Hinata completely ignored all of it, she thinks to herself.

"Our opponent is a monster after all, so it cannot be helped."

"And the doctrines also directly prohibit it..."

Sare and Renard whispers.

Had they been in the same shoes as Hinata, they would likely have done the same thing.

How can they listen to a monster when the doctrines are unquestionable?

If Hinata really listened, it would probably lead to huge backlash that renders her a public enemy of Lubelius.

"Moreover, I was secretly informed that Rimuru was an enemy of my dear mentor..."

"How is that the case?"

"Didn't I mention it? I was also manipulated---by the eastern merchants. At the time, they came with the news that a monster had disguised himself as human in an attempt to invade other countries. They said that he built a kingdom in order to deceive the neighboring nations. They also mentioned that the ruler of that kingdom, this monster named Rimuru, was the fiend that murdered my teacher. That's why I went to execute him without hesitation."

"And to cause him to escape later? I really can't tell whether it is a good or bad thing..."

Sare shakes his head helplessly after hearing Hinata's explanation.

Sare is right however, since Rimuru has become a huge concern today, which Hinata also agrees. Yet there would likely be a conflict no matter how it went down.

"He was highly skillful during his escape. Now that he has become Demon Lord, he must have undergone evolution, so opposing him is not the wise move to take."

No one objects Hinata's view.

There is no use to refer to the doctrines now that the divine order of God has been issued. If that's the case, frankly they should just accept that reality from now on and try and make peace with the opposing party.

"Then, what is Hinata-sama planning to do?"

Renard asks.

In response, Hinata replies calmly: "We stay put."

If the other side were human enemies, she would be willing to gamble her life in a battle. Yet since Demon Lord Rimuru has expressed hope to communicate with other nations, Hinata has decided to approve his actions. Because she doesn't wish to defy the holy will of Luminas.

That is however, unless Rimuru's actions become malicious...

"What should we do if Demon Lord Rimuru considers Hinata-sama as an enemy?"

"Right. It's true that boss tried to kill him. Now this Rimuru has become many times stronger after evolving into a Demon Lord, it wouldn't be strange for him to seek revenge against you."

Hearing this, Hinata shuns their many concerns.

"Didn't I just tell you all? Just consider all of these my own judgement. I am actually planning to visit and talk to him in person while our relation is still undetermined. If necessary, I wouldn't mind kneeling to apologize," Hinata answered nonchalantly.

Now that Hinata has said words that everyone can't just simply overlook.

"That's just reckless!"

"It is too dangerous!"

"Demon Lord Rimuru may be scheming to eliminate Hinata-sama, you could be killed if you walk into his trap!"

"Even if Hinata-sama isn't being plotted against, if that monster's underlings decide to attack in groups..."

"Everyone, calm down. I am not planning to take off just yet. The most important thing now is to correctly interpret what Demon Lord Rimuru wants---"

Hinata is only telling everyone to stay calm because she believes there won't be any issue.

There have been reports pointing out that Rimuru is very kind and friendly to others.

She recalls how she felt during her encounter with Rimuru and doesn't find much reason to suspect this observation.

I would be able to be forgiven if I go out of my way to show my sincerity and talk with him---Although it is a one-sided view, Hinata truly believes so.

Yet her wish would not come true.

Human greed intertwined with evil intents have tainted the situation--- Manipulated it far beyond Hinata's expectation.

Things are beginning to take a turn for the worst.

![soft scene break]

A knock echoes on the conference room.

*It must be Reyhiem and Nicolaus*, Hinata thought to herself. Everyone has been expecting them. "Please come in" she says. Upon issuing this concise permission, the knights guarding outside obeys and open the door.

The person entering is someone being expected by Hinata.

It is Hinata's trusted subordinate, Nicolaus Speltus.

He enters the room followed by Archbishop Reyhiem who has a nervous expression.

Until now, everything has been proceeding as expected.

But, Hinata frowns as she sees the people entering next.

These are completely unexpected visitors: The Seven Luminary Clerics.

"Long time no see, Hinata."

"How have you been?"

"What is it, why do you look so surprised?"

Hinata is shocked to the point of speechlessness seeing this unfolding before her.

"Why are you here...?"

She can't help but ask.

Nicholas, who is almost always calm in conduct looks panicked as well, alongside Reyhiem, who seems terrified.

"Boss, who are these people?"

Sare asks. He gets an immediate response. Instead of from Hinata, it is Nicholas who led them here.

"S-Sare, how rude or you! These are the masters of the Seven Luminaries."

Sare suddenly realizes as Nicholas words reach his ear.

"Seven Luminaries? The ones from the legend?"

"Yes, these are the sages."

Even Hinata cuts in to introduce them. Hearing this, everyone on site immediately rises up to salute---

---They are the great sages known as "Seven Luminary Clerics".

Each one them have surpassed the average "Sage". They are legendary figures who have even trained Chosen Heroes in the past. They have completely masked their presence from the public eye and become legends that only live in fairy tales or folk lore. Even the Holy Knights are unaware of their actual existence.

There are an extremely small group of people, including Hinata and Nicolaus who have actually laid eyes on them... Only a few high-ranking officials within the Western Holy Church have had the honor to see these people.

The "Trials of Seven Luminaries" that Hinata once went through was created by them. It was a trial used to select Heroes and Chosen Hero. From knowing that they are responsible for the trial alone, you can tell the magnitude of their authority.

But Hinata really dislikes them.

In reality, the so-called "Seven Luminaries" are the highest consultants of Western Holy Church and are responsible for overseeing different organizations and training new knights. All of these assignments are given by Luminas. Yet before Hinata came into her position, the Holy Knight Order was an organization with only their name but nothing to back it up.

In Hinata's view, the Seven Luminary Clerics have already been derelict in their duty.

*Now that I think about it, I should have robbed them of their power completely.*

Hinata has such a thought crossing her mind.

Her ability---Unique Skill 'Usurper' has two main functions.

They are respectively, "Usurp" that can rob power from her opponent and "Duplication" which allows her to copy and learn skills.

At the start of her trial, Hinata thought these people to be the great figures from legend. That's why in order to learn from them, Hinata used "Duplication" to improve herself.

In some way, Hinata can be considered as a student of the "Seven Luminary Clerics".

But it caused much displeasure for the Seven Luminaries.

They were annoyed by Hinata because she was stronger than them. And so, they decided to bother and challenge her for countless days and nights.

These cunning foxes hid behind the shield of Western Holy Church and ran the show for too long. Yet these people are extremely unproductive. If Hinata knew this when she initially partook the trial, she would have labelled the Seven Luminaries as old crooks without hesitation and deprive them of their power permanently.

Nowadays, Hinata has used the skills she learnt from the seven sages to pass on and train Arnaud and the rest of the captains the same skills.

*Perhaps it is for this reason that Luminas-sama wanted me to undergo the "Trials of Seven Luminaries" ---*

As she thinks so, Hinata praises Luminas for her keen eye for talent.

In Hinata's view, the Seven Luminaries have already abandoned their duty of fostering new generations of fighters. Luminas must have some other plan for them to have let them keep their position of power despite their dereliction of duty for so long.

And it is for that reason Hinata acts as if she is obedient to them---

After saluting, the crowds wait quietly as the sages take their seats.

"Well then, what do we owe the honor to have your presence today---?"

Hinata asks as everyone's representative.

"Hehehe, don't be so nervous." ^[In the original text, the Celestial Sages' dialogue used a different quotation sign to indicate they communicate directly through telepathy.]

"Indeed. Didn't Archbishop Reyhiem here bring back information regarding Demon Lord Rimuru?"

"We are interested in it too."

The voices of the Seven Luminaries are channeled directly to their heads through "Telepathy", to give their answer.

"Now then---", Hinata says while thinking calmly.

Only three of the Seven Luminaries are present here.

Hinata personally thinks these three are the most corrupted of the seven. Especially one of them---The fire-wielding "Sage of Fire" Azu, who can hardly even reach Shizue Izawa in terms of power. There was nothing worth learning from him. Hinata didn't even need to use "Usurper" to pass his trial.

Despite being such a cheap-shot, he seems to have also misunderstood Hinata, believing that she was simply unable to take his power from him. That's why he is rather annoying to Hinata for his constant disdain for her.

The other two are "Sage of Moon" Dana and "Sage of Metal" Vena. They most likely came to back Azu up.

*This is bad. Luminas has ordered me to take care of this matter properly...*

A shred of unease passes through Hinata's mind at that thought.

Considering the situation as it is now, Rimuru's impression of Hinata is already pretty bad. Now that these three have come to cause trouble, it may ruin the prospect of making peace. But while their goal here is still not clear; it is most urgent however listen to Rayhiem's account.

After being urged by the three, Reyhiem begins his explanation.

Hinata puts away her feelings to listen to what Reyhiem has to say.

"It was most foolish of me. We accidentally ran into a terrifying foe. It was truly horrifying. He is undoubtedly a real Demon Lord. It is us who allowed a new Demon Lord to be born!"

Reyhiem shouts as his eyes begin to turn bloodshot during his emotional recollection of what he experienced. He begins to retell the course of events that birthed the terrifying new Demon Lord.

Reyhiem even spills all the bad deeds done by his own army despite no one ordering so. He flashes out everything he knows in a forceful drive of will. He must have been trying to rid himself of the pain and by doing so, is pleading forgiveness from God to atone for his sins.

Even the Holy Knights are shaken by the details of his account of the birth of Demon Lord Rimuru.

The sheer combat ability of the enemy was shocking.

Even their Holy Barrier would not be able to stand up against those light beam attacks, let alone the anti-magic barrier (or anti-monster) or the more commonly applied, defensive barriers that defend against wide-area magic attacks.

They've never heard of such magic before.

They themselves are probably unable to stand against an attack that could penetrate their protective barriers.

But Hinata remains calm.

She deduces from Rayhiem's report that it is likely an attack beam converted from gathered sunlight.

And soon her deduction is proven true---

"Hmm. That sounds a lot like Gran-sama's sunlight magic."

"Is it the kind of magic that bends light? If that's the case, can't it be sealed by an anti-magic barrier?"

"Besides, its power is not that strong."

The Seven Luminaries begin to express their "brilliant" opinions.

"Sage of Sun" Gran is the head of the Seven Luminaries and controls the element of "Light". One of his skills can gather and concentrate sunlight.

Although the magic that the Seven Luminaries are talking about should be different from this, Hinata thinks it sounds rather similar, so her guess is likely not far from the truth.

*Idiots. There's no way he used magic to directly bend sunlight. He must have utilized some other means to reflect the sunlight before converging them into beams. Perhaps he has borrowed the power of wind and water spirits? But if he wanted to actually do so, he would need quite the calculative power...*

Even if that is the case, Hinata is still not afraid.

If she knew the origin of his strength, countering it would then be a piece of cake. She would be able to stop the enemy's attack by summoning a protective barrier that dissipates heat and sprays dust particles into the air to disperse the light source. This attack is full of flaws if only utilizing sunlight. To Hinata, such attack isn't even worth mentioning.

*It seems like that he is using the scientific knowledge from the other world. In this way, he must think that it would be hard for the uninformed people in this world to deal with it. For him to have exploited the weakness of magic defenses... I see that he's not only cautious, but quite intelligent...*

Thoughts are going through Hinata's head.

Rimuru indeed possesses incredible calculative power and he is only made more of a threat given his ability to wield multiple types of magic at the same time. However, since Hinata has seen him in person, she doesn't feel the need to fear like the rest.

But, Hinata's conclusion seems to have been made too early.

Reyhiem isn't finished yet.

There's more story to tell...or rather, what follows next is the climax.

"Please hold on everyone. That mysterious attack was indeed powerful. Folgen-sama was killed almost instantly. Even Razen-sama couldn't do a thing about it. Near ten-thousand knights probably all died due to that one attack. But---"

Reyhiem pauses for a second.

There were people who either passed out or cried due to their severe injuries. Even those without injury were scared to insanity and hiding on the battlefield. These soldiers just incited a massive commotion and all over the battlefield, you could hear the sounds of despair.

He gulps loudly, as cold sweats drip profusely down his face when he says, shivering---

"---It only got more terrifying from there. The battlefield became silent the very next moment."

All of these sounds disappeared---Reyhiem says.

"What do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said, Hinata-sama. The survivors of the twenty-thousand army were killed instantly. The sole survivors are the three of us: me, Razen-sama and the Farmus King Edmalis. I completely lost my mind after witnessing the scene and was scared unconscious---"

Reyhiem finishes up...

There is silence in the sacred cathedral.

A single monster was able to massacre the entire twenty-thousand army---The crowds are speechless before this fact presented before them. The silence is accompanied by a nervous air as everyone begins to recall a certain legend.

There was once a group of individuals who could single-handedly destroy nations. They became Demon Lords, and so, legends---

Hinata also begins to recall.

She recalls what Luminas said to her.

It is rumored that the early concept of the Western Holy Church began to gain prominence around a thousand years ago. According to the history of the nation (Lubelius), there are records of it tracing back to around twelve hundred years ago.

It has been two thousand years since the old kingdom was destroyed by Veldora and the people immigrated to this location.

Veldora's stubbornness and immortal flesh were extraordinary and fighting him seriously would only further the destruction.

Since the vampires could only obtain high-quality spirits from the blood of humans, if Veldora's reckless actions lead to humans' extinction, it would also sabotage the food source of the vampires. It may be a different case for more ancient vampires such as Luminas, but it is a life or death situation for lower vampires. That's why Luminas had no choice but to come up with a system to coexist with them and thus devoted herself to the protection of mankind. She was raised to Godhood for her rescue and leadership of the humans in the past.

Everything about this nation was caused by a rampaging Veldora.

It was an existence far more persistent and difficult to deal with than any kind of natural phenomenon.

That's why he was called "Catastrophe".

Right now, they are called Special Rank S, i.e. not suitable for humans to handle. However... He was not the only one that has caused mass-destruction.

Right now, the only individuals labeled as Special Rank S are the four "True Dragons". But that is merely a surface record for the public... According to historic texts, there are also two Demon Lords who have also caused great destruction.

They are the "Lord of Darkness" Guy Crimson and "Destroyer" Milim Nava.

All of the Demon Lords are listed as S Rank, but among themselves, there is also a difference of strong and weak ones. These two for instance, are Special Rank S whose ranking for some reason, cannot be disclosed to the public.

Luminas said, a "Demon Lord Seed" can be awakened.

By raining mass destruction and absorb large amount of human "Soul", the "Demon Lord Seed" will awake and undergo an incredibly powerful evolution. The Demon Lords truly worthy of their titles are the awakened, "True Demon Lord". At the same time, there are different stages to their evolution, and some Demon Lords may even stand against a "True Dragon".

As for Guy and Milim, Luminas seems to believe both have exceeded the power scale of a "True Dragon".

Even Luminas, who is also a "True Demon Lord", is no match for the two.

"If the opponent is Milim, I should be able to pull a trick on her. It would probably be a fun fight, but it's one that I'll definitely lose."

This is what Luminas had to say about her.

So, what if the opponent is Guy?

"Ha! Although I hate to admit it, but I am no match for him. He is extremely powerful."

To Hinata, Luminas is already strong beyond belief, yet she easily claims that Guy is stronger.

Guy must be ridiculously strong for someone as confident as Luminas to assert that she won't be able to defeat him. Apart from that, Milim also had her legendary battle with Guy, and so she must also be a monster beyond Hinata's imagination.

"Special Rank S" is the term used to describe these monsters.

In theory, it may be possible to stand against them by gathering the strength of "Humanity", but that is but optimistic speculation. The reason is being that the whole of humanity would also include the Chosen Hero. Now that there is no active Chosen one however, the reality is that humanity won't stand a chance against them.

Moreover---

The new Demon Lords --- "Octagram" cannot be simply dismissed.

Demon Lord Rimuru is no exception.

From Luminas's understanding, Rimuru seems to have also awakened.

Rayhiem's testimony just now is enough to prove that.

Following Hinata's footsteps, the rest are beginning to recall as well.

---They are reminded of the fearsome awakened Demon Lords.

This information has not been disclosed to public to prevent unnecessary concerns over the existence of creature who threaten mankind.

The original "True Dragon" (Veldanava) has lost its power and there hasn't been any sign of its resurrection. One of the remaining three was sealed until it was unfortunately revived recently. And it has also allied with Demon Lord Rimuru who has become the focus of discussion right now.

And speaking about this Demon Lord Rimuru, he was able to decimate twenty-thousand men army by himself. This kind of behavior is quite similar to what the other two Demon Lords have done. It wasn't enough to amount to mass-destruction, but it is highly likely he has absorbed a massive amount of human "Soul".

The solemn silence persists as no one wants to admit the fact that a new True Demon Lord has been born to this world.

The difference between "Demon Lord Seed" and "True Demon Lord" is night and day. Everyone at the scene is aware of this.

No one is saying a thing, and the one to break the silence is---

"Is it now? Then we will have to assume Demon Lord Rimuru has "Awakened" ..."

Hinata states calmly.

Her words became a sharp blade that pierced the silence. And so, the people who can no longer bear the silence found some motivation to speak as well.

"I suppose we should. So, what are we going to do? If we leave him like this, won't he become a threat we can no long deal with in the future?"

"Calm down. Demon Lord Rimuru was once human as well. If he wishes for coexistence, then we don't need to force ourselves to oppose him."

"Indeed. We will have to see how they act first."

"But it is also a fact that he murdered twenty thousand knights without hesitation... He is indeed dangerous. Can we really trust Demon Lord Rimuru...?"

Renard was the last one to express his opinion, and the one whose opinion resonates with everyone's heart.

In the end, all wars originate from suspicion and distrustful guesswork. If it is the case, when it comes to humans, it will be just as difficult for the Demon Lord to just take their word for it.

It may be easy to do so if the knights can march on him at any time, yet Rimuru's strength is growing rapidly. To the Guardians of Mankind, the Holy Knights and Sword of Pope, the Imperial Guards, it makes a lot of sense to challenge him before he grows to the point of being undefeatable.

However, Hinata is still not moved by it.

"Everyone, please stop. The divine order cannot be defied."

Hinata declares with determination.

She won't change her mind no matter what she hears.

Hinata is the head of knights within the Pope's Imperial Guards and the Commander of the Holy Knight Order. She must be a role model and rule the Holy Knights with determination in order to lead the Holy Empire of Lubelius.

Unless it is to obey Luminas's will, Hinata will not change her mind.

That's why Hinata is able to assert this without hesitation.

As such, the united conference soon comes to an end. Everyone is supposedly going back to intelligence gathering as planned---supposedly...

Yet malicious intents linger in the air.

![soft scene break]

"Oh oh, Reyhiem. Is that all the "Message" you have?"

Before, the Seven Luminaries were only observing on the side. Yet now they've actively intervened, trying to stop Hinata from ending the united conference.

Reyhiem takes out a crystal ball after being urged by these words.

He hands it carefully to Hinata.

"R-right, and this. Demon Lord Rimuru has some words for Hinata-sama---"

"He has words for me?"

Feeling suspicious, Hinata takes in the object.

If Rimuru has something to say, she has to listen to it.

The crystal ball handed by Reyhiem as ordered by the Seven Luminaries is an expensive magic item that allows anyone to record video footage with the device. It is one of the many communication methods that work as better evidence compared to written letters, and so it is often used in communication between nations as well.

Putting aside the origin of such expensive item, Hinata immediately replays said message recorded by Rimuru himself. Since all of the prominent figures of the nation are all gathered here, they may as well get to learn about the Demon Lord Rimuru himself too.

However, things are not that simple...

The crystal ball projects the image of a beautiful young girl.

No, not a young girl, it's Demon Lord Rimuru himself.

His face is quite similar to Hinata's teacher Shizue Izawa, extremely grim and without any emotion. Although this is only a projection, his imposing aura is very evident.

*How surprising, he seems to have changed completely in just a few months---*

Hinata stares at him with eyes wide.

Soon, her eyes meet with the ones of the Demon Lord in the projection.

Could this be a coincidence...

Unknowingly, Hinata begins to find herself nervous.

This Rimuru came from the same place as her and appears to be very friendly.

*Due to how strong this first impression was, I may have overestimated him too much*, Hinata remarked to herself.

The very next moment, almost as if he's is trying to prove her thoughts, he says---

"I shall be your opponent. Come, fight me in a duel."

That is all.

It is a simple enough message and impossible to misunderstand.

![break]

Rimuru has been angered. After taking out the Demon Lord Clayman who was in his way, has it finally time for Hinata?

![break]

These thoughts are on everyone's mind.

"W-what should we do, Hinata-sama?"

Nicolaus asks Hinata, panicked--- something highly unusual compared to his normal conduct.

Yet, Hinata isn't making any response---

"Hinata-sama, please give me the order! I shall lead the troops to crush this ambition of the Demon Lord!"

Arnaud, who's suddenly been filled with zeal, jumps out to volunteer himself.

The crowd then restarts the discussion.

Sare looks at Arnaud, quite shocked while commenting jokingly:

"Arnaud, you may be good with a sword, but there seems to be some issues with your head."

"---What did you say?!"

"Nothing really, but didn't boss just tell us to stay out of this? If we are to make a move, the other Demon Lords won't just sit back and watch. Besides, he may have awakened, so we can't be reckless. The best option now is to be cautious and accept his proposal."

"That's right, Arnaud. And there's still Veldora, who we have no chance to win against. In fact, we will suffer great losses even if we win. If they wish for a duel, we should just leave the matter to Hinata-sama."

Ritase jumps in to support Sare.

If they and their troops are engaged in an intense battle with their enemies, there will definitely result in heavy losses. And whether they can emerge victorious is also in question.

Since this is the case, it is not a bad idea to send out Hinata, the strongest knight of Holy Empire of Lubelius to fight alone.

Sare and Ritase both believe Hinata will be victorious, and for that reason they remain optimistic and support her.

Hinata is also reflecting on the whole issue.

Naturally, Arnaud's proposal to launch an assault is not an option.

It will drag the entire nation down with it, and in time, just as Ritase said, it will lead to a total war.

With further consideration of their geographical position, it will even endanger the Western Nations, turning this into a world war. If that's the case, Lubelius with much more subjects to protect will be disadvantageous, nor is it what Luminas has wished for.

Right now, the biggest threat is, no doubt, Veldora. On just minimizing casualties alone, the invitation to duel with Demon Lord Rimuru is more than Hinata could wish for. Yet she still has doubts.

*Then, what should I do...*

Hinata begins to ponder.

Considering now, it was lucky that she didn't assault the monster kingdom when the situation had yet to clear up.

It is all thanks to Luminas's wise eyes.

There is no use sending any number of troops when the opponent has awakened to be "True Demon Lord". Even with elite soldiers enlisted in the army, they won't be of much use if they don't reach a certain level of strength. The miserable state of the Farmus army to be left with only three survivors is sufficient enough to prove this point.

---No, that's still inaccurate.

Rimuru couldn't have been awakened during his battle against the Farmus army. He needed the "Souls" of the defeated Farmus army in order to achieve evolution.

He was able to take out the twenty-thousand men army when unawakened.

*What an absolute monster...*

Thinking back to her battle with Rimuru, he didn't seem that capable back then. But there is also the possible explanation that he intentionally made a concession because the opponent was Hinata.

Would such a person be planning to kill her even to this day?

Even if he does hate Hinata to the bone, it is still quite unnatural for someone seeking revenge to invite her to a duel.

And even though his motives may be to remove the obstacles posed by Hinata and the Western Holy Church, Rimuru shouldn't strike first. If he is dumb enough to not know this, how is it possible for him to come up with the scheme against the Kingdom of Farmus?

With that being said, there may also be another reason.

*It's quite strange, no matter how I think about it. Has the situation changed? Or perhaps, evolving to Demon Lord has deprived him of humanity---?*

A human's mind can be easily corrupted by such immense power.

For instance, Shizue put in much effort trying to suppress the power of Ifrit, whose enormous power can easily destroy a person.

Moreover, the fact that Rimuru has awakened...

*---No, there shouldn't be such thing. It wouldn't make sense for him to says that he is on the human's side if that's the case...*

Luminas mentioned that Rimuru announced his desire to protect mankind. Had he lost his humanity, his talk of building a utopian city would be nothing but claptrap.

There is still not enough information, Hinata thinks to herself. She believes there's still truth hidden behind all this, yet her "Mathematician" cannot work out the right answer.

Moreover, the message recorded in this crystal ball also seems weird.

It could have recorded a large amount of content, yet the actual message only consists of a short line of words. No matter how she puts it, she feels that there's some other intent hidden behind the message.

Apart from that---

*Just now, "Sage of Fire" Azu seemed to know that Rimuru had a message for me; why is that the case?*

Reyhiem only mentioned the origin and development of the whole ordeal, yet he didn't once mention a message from Rimuru. Yet Azu asked "Is that all the "Message" you have?". Hinata finds that part to be abnormal.

Doubts begin to be raised in Hinata's heart. Yet her expression didn't change at all as she decides to suppress her suspicions. She needs to think about the matter and not ignore any small signs. It is unfortunate however, considering the lack of information. Hinata is simply doing her calculations as always, trying to find an answer, yet she can't find the correct solution.

And so Hinata decides to no longer hesitate and choose the best available solution.

"It can't be helped then. Since they have demanded me by name, I suppose I'll have to explain things in person."

Hinata sighs while giving her final conclusion.

If that's what Rimuru wishes, she can accept the invitation to his duel. But she wants to find out first whether there is still room for negotiation or not. She will get to the answer as soon as they meet.

It would be much more meaningful than sitting and being troubled here.

*Regardless, since things have developed to this point, it is up to me to conclude things---*

Hinata makes up her mind.

"This is too dangerous! If we already know that Demon Lord Rimuru bears no good intent, there will be no need for Hinata-sama to go in person!"

Nicolaus speaks up in a nervous tone, yet Hinata isn't changing her decision.

"Can we really find an answer without knowing what is on our opponent's mind? I still have to apologize to him anyway. Regardless of the situation, I will have to see him one way or another. Shouldn't I, at least, go and try to negotiate with him?"

Hinata replies, trying to end the discussion on that note.

However, some decide to interject her.

It's the three masters of the Seven Luminaries.

"Hehehe, what a wonderful decision!"

"May the blessings of Luminas be upon you."

"Demon Lord Rimuru is indeed a threat."

"It won't matter if you can't establish common ground."

"If it's Hinata, you can definitely defeat him."

"But Hinata, don't you forget."

"Indeed, there's still that evil dragon."

"Even you wouldn't be able to take down that evil dragon!"

"Don't overestimate your strength, Hinata."

"Any form of attack wouldn't harm that evil dragon."

"But Hinata, rest assured."

"We grant you this."

"We grant you the Holy Dragon Slaying Sword (Dragon Buster)!"^[Bootleg Dragon Slayer]

The three begin to talk to Hinata among themselves.

*I can't stand this; how unsubtle can you be? I said I just wanted to talk, yet you've concluded that I'm going to fight Rimuru. Your goal must be for me to take out Veldora. Or perhaps, some other intent---*

The Seven Luminaries are ex-humans^[Their evolution and other factors have made them somewhat "inhuman".] recognized by Luminas. So, it's somewhat understandable for them to attempt to eliminate Veldora who is hated by Luminas... But Hinata has found out that they have other reasons than that.

The "Seven Luminary Clerics" are afraid.

They are afraid of new talents that may lower their prestigious status by Luminas.

That must be why they've been so unenthusiastic about training a new generation of fighters and why they're trying to eliminate people in their way.

*Fools. I shall inform Luminas-sama that you are all a bunch of good-for-nothing parasites---*

But even so, Hinata remains unfazed in her expression.

The judgement call will be left for Luminas to decide, so Hinata will not make a move so easily.

That's why Hinata replies unfazed.

"I shall obey thy will; much obliged for the sword."

Hinata finishes her words as she takes the Dragon Buster from "Sage of Metal" Vena's hand.

Seeing her acceptance, the three nodded with satisfaction---

"We hope to receive news of your triumphant feat."

"If you run into any emergency situation, that sword shall protect you."

"But if you fail, you shall take all the responsibility."

Leaving these words, the Seven Luminaries turn on their heels and leave.

"Hinata-sama..."

The Holy Knights try to say something but are gestured to stop by Hinata.

"Now then, you should all go back to your missions. The united conference is now dismissed."

She declares so while signaling her eyes to Pope Louis behind the royal veil.

The "Three Martial Sages" remain silent, seemingly pondering something.

The Holy Knights respect Hinata's will and follow her order.

As such, this conference filled with twists and turns has finally come to an end.

![hard scene break]

Hinata awoke from a light sleep.

She fell asleep without knowing after immersing herself in memories.

She smells the fragrance of coffee as soon as she woke up. The sight that comes to her is that of Nicolaus preparing breakfast in the other room to take care of Hinata.

![exact fit image](image5)

"Ah, have you woken?" ^[Nicolaus is using a respectful pronoun for Hinata during this entire conversation.]

He is Cardinal Nicolaus Speltus.

Come to think of it, this man is an oddball.

Not only is he a trusted subordinate of the Pope and the highest executive of the Holy Empire of Lubelius, he is also the actual holder of power within the Western Holy Church^[i.e. he does all the work for the Pope]. Yet a man like him pledged his loyalty only to Hinata and her alone like an obedient puppy.

"Come, breakfast is ready. Why don't you have a bite?"

Hinata suddenly wants to laugh.

No one would have imagined that Nicolaus Speltus would ever prepare breakfast for anyone.

Anyone who has seen his normal self would have all commented that Nicolaus is a devil with the mask of a clergyman.

"All right, I gratefully accept (いただく). Thanks a lot."

Hinata didn't think too much on her answer and is met with a delighted nod from Nicolaus.

The two begin to eat breakfast. She has been longing for some delicious meal.

Moreover, she's even been missing out on proper sleep due to the pilling amount of work lately.

But, for a while all of these are going to come to an end---

"...Are you really going?"

"Yeah. I have to take responsibility."

"But it was me who summoned Reyhiem---"

"And I've accepted it. You don't have to worry over this issue."

"Can't you...reconsider the idea..."

"Annoying. Besides, you don't have to worry. It is unlikely to lead to war."

And moreover, if a fight really breaks out, she still has a chance to win.

Hinata still an ace up her sleeve. Not that garbage Dragon Buster, but something much greater---

In addition---Luminas gave her the order of "Do what you see necessary". So Hinata has no intention of getting herself killed. If it really comes to that, and Demon Lord Rimuru really is "Awakened", Hinata still has confidence in defeating him as of this stage.

So, there is nothing to worry about.

She isn't fully confident in winning, but Hinata is good at fighting opponents stronger than her. Not only that, since she has more than one trump card. But she should avoid discussing about such depressing topic on a wonderful morning like this.

"There shouldn't be a problem this time either. So, don't worry, Nicolaus."

That's why Hinata says so to him with a smile, her tone is soft and gentle and a rare smile without any reservation.

---And soon, Hinata will be on the move.
