# Chapter 4: The Second|Confrontation

The road to Dwargon is completed alongside the official opening of the road to the Kingdom of Blumund. Yet we are still getting busier by the day. We still have to construct the new road that leads to Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion and also plan out the new city construction project for Milim's group. There was still tons of work to be done.

On top of all these, we are also planning a massive celebration while quietly executing on our grand scheme to take over the Kingdom of Farmus. I thought that there would probably be a lot of nuisances to come after becoming a Demon Lord, yet my workload has reached my limit before any problems even occur.

In the midst of these busy days, we received some disastrous news.

Souka has returned to bring the news that Hinata Sakaguchi is heading to our kingdom. As she reported this to me half-out of breath, I immediately started to get a headache.

I cancelled my original schedule of inspecting the blacksmith workshop and returned to my office. There, Souka gave me a more detailed explanation. Hinata seems to be heading here alone without any subordinate.

"She is all by herself?"

"Yes. Nansou is currently conducting surveillance at the outskirt of the barrier set up in Lubelius. He said that he didn't see anyone else leaving the Holy Capital. And the only person departing from the Kingdom of Ingracia was that Hinata who Rimuru-sama told us to keep an eye out for."

Souka says so while looking straight at me.

It seems that our espionage operations are operating to almost perfection under Souei's guidance. Since Souka has made such assertion, the report is likely to be true as well.

Just as I am about to conclude---

"Please hold on for a second! There are some new observations!"

Touka shouts as she suddenly emerges from Souka's shadow.

"What happened?"

"Yes, Souka-sama! There are four Holy Knights following Hinata's trail!"

"Only four?"

"Indeed. But their abilities are not to be underestimated. They likely used some kind magic and so we lost track of them right away..."

Touka reported to me with Souka looking rather frustrated.

Uh---What in the world is going on here?

Did they go after Hinata after learning she's launching a secret assault? But it sounds too improbable.

Or did they go in groups knowing they're being watched---If that's the case, they should have acted more cautiously.

I'm completely baffled, as expected from Hinata.

She seems to have us completely caught off guard here.

Is she attempting to remove hindrances like us by assaulting us with their strongest forces?

She probably has predicted that less skilled individuals would only get in the way.

In other words...

"Is Hinata intending to go to war with us?"

I don't really intend to fight Hinata, but on the other hand, it completely depends on her actions. Nowadays I won't be beaten by her quite as easily, but still, I cannot let down my guard against her.

And I was hoping she would want to have a talk with me after receiving my message...

"I'm not sure. But she is carrying a suspicious looking sword on her back. It doesn't seem like they've come to negotiate."

Hmm---She's armed too.

But this still seems pretty reasonable in this world, considering she is visiting a Demon Lord's---in other words, my territory, there is no way she would come bare handed. In this case, it seems too early to conclude that Hinata is trying to wage war against us.

"With this information alone seems pretty hard to determine..."

"But those Holy Knights were all armed to the teeth---"

"Oh, is that so? Are you sure about it?"

"Yes! It's a hundred percent true!"

A hundred percent true?

Touka replied quite energetically. According to her, the Holy Knights meeting up with Hinata seem to be armed to the teeth.

It seems way too much like they are planning on waging war instead of negotiating.

I don't want to start a war---Regretfully, I think to myself .

Such action of trying to eliminate us monsters like some kind of evil has completely removed any possibility of peaceful coexistence.

What is she searching for?

If we don't try to understand each other, we can only eliminate each other...

If that's the case, it will lead to a massive war that jeopardizes the life and death of both her and our species.

If Hinata refuses to negotiate with us, it would mean they are trying to impose their ideologies onto us. Ignoring our circumstances and are unwilling to hear our explanations.

I don't think such actions constitute the true meaning of justice.

Is Hinata really oblivious to such a basic thing?

Even though during our first encounter, she attacked without hearing me out first, yet she still doesn't appear to be that stupid...

So, could the reason actually be due to the doctrines of Luminism?

Perhaps she feels like there is no need to listen to the opponents' views since they are monsters.

Doctrines, to some extent, are beneficial and important, but by blindly following their doctrines, it truly does no good for anyone.

There has been too much bloodshed in the name of religion, it should be common sense to us Japanese people of this generation^[Google Aum Shinrikyo if you are interested to learn about one of the most infamous Japanese cult in late 1990s. (which is likely what Satoru is referring to)].

Isn't it important to see things and hear things for yourself before making judgement? Isn't it foolish to do the equivalent of giving up thinking by not doing either?

At the end of the day, whether or not the accumulated knowledge can be used is up to the individual.

After obtaining information, how should it be evaluated and acted upon; whatever outcome results is the responsibility of decision maker to bear. If Hinata chooses to stand against us, then we will have to send out our troops to fend off the enemies.

Yet the stream of bad news has yet to end.

Shaking my head, I try to readjust my mindset.

"It can't be helped. Let's get together all the executives here and discuss a solution---"

Having learnt that Hinata may launch an assault here, I can't just sit idly by and watch. Even though there are only five people, their strength cannot be underestimated.

Anecdotally, it's always the carefully chosen heroes and their companions who manage to defeat a Demon Lord. This is the abiding principle.

Becoming a Demon Lord is not my original intent, but I'm not that kind to let them kill me without putting up a fight.

I will take on Hinata, and we'll have to decide who is going to handle the rest of the Holy Knights, respectively. Bearing such thoughts, I plan to hold a meeting in order to discuss a plan, but then...

"Rimuru-sama, I have something to report..."

Diablo spoke to me seemingly with discomfort written all over his face.

"What's wrong? Is there a problem?"

The "Is there" part is redundant, there are definitely problems.

Because, unlike his usual self, Diablo's actions are lacking in his usual confidence.

"Yes, there's an issue."

"What is it?"

"Reyhiem is dead, cause of death unknown. But I suspect that he was murdered."

At the time of when Diablo last saw him, he seems to be in a fine and healthy condition, which leaves only two possibilities to explain his death, either there was some accident, or he was murdered.

"Rimuru-sama even worried once about him getting silenced, it is indeed my miscalculation that lead to this happening..."

The tone of Diablo's voice is filled with apology when he said so.

Speaking of, I do recall having mentioned it. Originally, it was just some cursory thought, yet it really did come true...

The event took place within Holy Empire of Lubelius where communication is blocked by barriers, thus making the details of the incident unobtainable. But based on all the events that took place, Diablo thinks the likelihood of murder is very high.

After hearing this information, it turns out that the situation seems to be far more severe than I expected.

"The neighboring kingdoms to Farmus have begun to spread the rumor that "the Archbishop's death was caused by the demon's conspiracy". This news has been broadcasted publicly through magic communication, causing the Templar Knight Orders stationed in many countries to mobilize. After several days of preparing, they seem to be on their way to rendezvous with the new king Edward..."

Diablo explains with a troubled expression.

Things have been developing unexpectedly, which means that Diablo's plan of taking over the Kingdom of Farmus must also have been disrupted.

Hinata just moved out, and now this happens.

The two must be---

<<Answer. It can be deduced that the two incidents are connected.>>

Hmm, I can totally recognize such simple pattern as well.

Do you think I'm some sort of useless fellow who can't even see such an obvious thing?

No no no, that's surely not the case.

Hahaha, even "Wisdom King"-san can be a troublesome fellow.^[Here Rimuru is actually taking a jab at Raphael for seemingly mocking him.]

But in any case, all these things are really giving me a migraine.

The Western Holy Church haven't declared us as the "Nemesis of God" yet, but if this is to continue, it eventually will happen.

Once they officially announce it, it will undoubtedly lead to all-out war.

This is our fault---For thinking that they would give up so easily.

I simply wanted to focus our priorities on national development, but that seems to be impossible now.

And with melancholic thoughts, I order Souka to summon all the executives.

![soft scene break]

As such, we begin the emergency meeting.

Everyone except Geld has arrived.

"Rimuru-sama, is it all right to leave Geld out?"

"It's all right. That he's busy working on large projects right now. This time, the conflict is between me and Hinata, so even if we break out into a fight, there is no need for the main troops to mobilize."

This isn't a war where we defend for the sake of our nation's survival, it's not right to dispatch a huge army against a small group of people.

Besides, in this world, there is no use sending in a huge army, it is useless in the face of an overwhelming difference of strength. The Holy Knights heading here are all powerful individuals exceeding Rank A. Without my lieutenants, this battle cannot be won.

Regardless, recalling all of Geld's subordinates now won't be easy either. I could use my teleportation magic but having them gather at a specified location at once will take too much time.

There are also the captives that need to be guarded, so I can't just suddenly give such reckless order.

Everyone expresses their agreement . In order to share the information with everyone, I ask Souei to explain the situation.

"Yes, allow me to explain. First of all, the intruders approaching Tempest Federation is a group of five including the commander of the Holy Knight Order. All of them seem to be the figures of leadership within the Holy Knight Order and each possess great power to the point where they can even give my crew the slip---"

The crowds gasp in shock.

Souka and her companions are at least above Rank A, so it is quite apparent that their opponents must have been extraordinarily powerful to be able to throw them off their trail. Perhaps they could have kept up by flying, but that would likely have exposed their cover. It's still commendable that they chose the correct option of restraining.

Moreover, a comprehensive security network has been established around the town, so Souei has already gotten a hold of Hinata's party's movements.

Control of information is the basis of strategizing.

It is very important to obtain intelligence beforehand so we can use it when forging our battle plan, so we won't panic when it's needed.

Speaking of which, Souei's skill in intelligence gathering is really something else. He uses techniques such as hiring an information dealer or engaging in infiltration using his "Clone" etc.

I taught Souei the techniques of being a ninja, yet he has developed his unique style now. Even though he was surprised when I appointed him as "Covert Agent" ^[As I was translating, the term I thought used is "密探" but it appears Souei's title has been "隠密", it's an a role in shogun government that acts similar to ninja in information collection.], it seems he is naturally gifted for the job.

Moreover, having learnt all sorts of practical methods from Fuze, he has become a true expert in espionage operation.

If everyone is able as far as he has with just my questionable understanding of various matters, no one will struggle... Or so I convinced myself.

Souka's party was trained by Souei, and they in turn are training their own subordinates. Furthermore, they're even utilizing the locals to gather intelligence. Nowadays, even without my directives, they would collect information that they deemed important by themselves.

Even now Souei is calmly explaining the situation.

He has grown to be quite reliable.

"Templar Knights in countries neighboring Farmus seem to be gathering around Farmus' borders. Moving in small groups, they are able to travel at great speed. Their numbers are estimated at over thirty thousand. It seems they don't intend on interfering in the Farmus civil war, as their objective is "to destroy the Demon" ...However, at this rate, Youm-dono is unlikely to receive aid from the influential nobles or from other countries."

Annoyance emerges on Diablo's face upon hearing this.

He seems to be aware of this information as well, so he doesn't seem surprised. However, the demon in question is no doubt Diablo, so he is likely concerned about where such information leaked from.

Still, thirty-thousand people is...

With each of the neighboring countries dispatching several hundred or several thousand troops, once gathered together, it becomes a massive force to be reckoned with. One which simply cannot be ignored.

Their logistics team could also transfer supplies in from the countryside infinitely, so a war of attrition would probably be disadvantageous for Youm's party.

It is indeed a troublesome development.

"---However, the kings of the various countries do not seem to be in line with the Church and are not dispatching their own troops. After all, the church seems to have several internal factions that complicates the chain of command. If we had a better understanding of their internal workings, we'd be able to make a conclusion..."

Souei says while slightly shaking his head, seemingly ashamed of the imperfection in his report.

Uh---This is one complicated organization.

Even Yuuki couldn't clearly explain its detailed structure, and most would just assume that the Templar Knight Orders are under the command of the Holy Knight Order.

"Had I known about this, I should have gotten clarifications from Reyhiem first..."

Diablo is troubled as well.

He mostly acts on his own deductions and won't ask for opinions from people who he deems lowly and unworthy. And this time that attitude has backfired.

"That's right! It's all your fault, Diablo. I think it would be best that as your *senpai*, I take over from here!!"

Shion immediately interjects after sensing the opportunity. She seems to be quite jealous of her junior Diablo who was given such an important task.

Normally Diablo would rebuke her, yet he seems to have concluded it to be his own miscalculation and stayed quiet.

Oh well, shall I try questioning Shion in his stead?

"---Say, Shion. Suppose I re-assigned the task of conquering Farmus to you, just what would you do?"

Just maybe---Yes, it may be just a one in a million chance, but perhaps Shion might actually demonstrate some outstanding ability to strategize---

"Yes sir! I'll command my troops to slaughter all those greasy nobles---"

---My ass.

"You idiot! No way! Not in a million years!"

If she destroyed the current power structure, then the civil war will definitely devolve into anarchy, with multiple factions vying for power.

In the absence of a ruler, the people would go after the throne one after another. By preserving the kingdom's ruling system and only replacing the leader, you can minimize damage as you slowly promote new policies. It is for this reason that such delicate work is best handled by Diablo who is both flexible and intelligent.

Shion is a no-go.

"I see, so it won't work after all..."

At least she's self-aware enough to withdraw from the conversation quietly with her mouth shut after dejecting a "Yes".

"Don't mention it if you know it won't work." I thought to myself. But I suppose it's probably more like she never intended to take Diablo's task away from him.

Or perhaps, I should say, this is Shion's way of giving Diablo an out after his misstep, it is her own way of caring for him.

In any case, I will leave Diablo to continue his work on the mission.

"Diablo, everyone will experience failure. Even I didn't actually expect Reyhiem to be killed off. Besides, it's not really that big a deal that your true nature has been exposed is it?"

"Eh! But, Rimuru-sama...? The involvement of a demon is already causing unrest, for me to continue the mission will only..."

Diablo looks at me in surprise.

It seems he was upset, thinking that I would reassign the mission to someone else.

"You know, after you fail, how you make amendments is what really matters. Anyone can take the easy route by resigning after taking on the responsibility! Besides, Youm's relationship with me has long been known to the public. Diablo, you may be a Demon, but you are my subordinate too. I don't care one bit about what they are in an uproar about, rather, shouldn't we be discussing about who is the culprit behind Rayhiem's murder is? As long as we can prove that you didn't murder him, everything will be all right, so there is no need to complicate things."

I am a Demon Lord after all.

Isn't it quite normal to have one or two demons as subordinate?

"Indeed. Shion is thinking the same thing, she knows she can't take your place."

"No, Shuna-sama. If it is me, I shall burn the Kingdom of Farmus to ashes right away---"

With a single glance, Shuna shuts Shion up mid-sentence. It was such a sharp stare that even Shion wouldn't dare to defy.

"---Which she has no intention of doing. Though it was rather tactless, that was just Shion's her way of encouraging you. You are one of us serving Rimuru-sama after all, so you shouldn't get dejected over such a minor mistake."

Shuna's words are both gentle and strict at the same time.

Yet Shion still decides to rebut this. It seems that she has a point that she has to respond with.

"Shuna-sama, you are giving me too much credit. As the first secretary, I was merely giving this newbie a demonstration of my authority as *senpai*."

She spoke with a smug look, but I can tell there's also a bit of fluster mixed in.

I see, it was indeed Shion trying to be encouraging. Although it is hard to tell, it does seem like something Shion would do. And Shuna indeed saw through that.

Normally Shion is always spouting muscle-brained stupidity, but occasionally she can be rather considerate.

"Well, it is what it is. Whether or not we send reinforcements will depend on our strategy moving forward. In the worst case, we can recall Geld, and I will go with him to the frontline."

Benimaru is also very attentive.

He doesn't mind the lack of numbers of his troops since he believes the tactics being employed are more important.

He proclaims with an aura of absolute confidence as if it will not be a problem at all to take on the Templar Knight Order altogether.

How reliable.

"---Then, it's okay for me to continue leading the operation...?"

"Of course. It's going to take everything I have to deal with Hinata, so your job is to take control of the Kingdom of Farmus. Besides, I was the one who authorized you to send out Reyhiem, so I'm partly to be blamed too. That's why you should spearhead this plan to conclusion. Or perhaps, are you saying it's too much for you? Then---"

"No, that's absurd! This is the duty granted by Rimuru-sama after all, please allow me to fully carry it out till the end."

"Can you handle it?"

"Kufufufufu, of course!"

"Good. Now go make up for your mistake with a grand victory!"

Diablo, now with his usual confidence and composure, replies with a nod.

It seems everything is settled.

Seeing that Diablo has been reinvigorated, Shuna replies with a smile:

"Rimuru-sama, I have a proposal."

"Oh, how rare, speak your mind then."

Shuna seldom raises any proposal, so without hesitation, I ask her to speak up.

"It's about Adalmann whom I defeated before. Shouldn't we inquire from him? It may have been hundreds of years ago, but he has, after all, spent much time in the Western Holy Church."

Speaking of which, this Adalmann is...

<<Answer. He is the one guarding Clayman's castle--->>

Oh oh! He was the undead monster who became Shuna's companion.

I recall that he became a Wight^[Wight is a type of undead creature depicted in western fantasy novels. (& DnD)] after losing his life.

I met him once before where he went on a tangent about his gratitude towards god. I suspected that he's the type with a severe case of delusional disorder.

Indeed, since Adalmann was once a member of the Western Holy Church, he may indeed know something about the organization. There are probably many differences comparing between then and now, but we don't stand to lose anything by just talking to him.

"That's a good idea. Let's have a chat with him."

As such, we should call him over immediately.

Currently Adalmann is assisting Gabil with conducting research in the sealed cave as well as standing in for guard duty. To summon him, Gabil used "Telepathy Net" to contact and informed him to come here immediately.

Adalmann immediately showed up, seemingly with the use of teleportation magic directly transporting him from inside the cave to town. Even though he has devolved into a wight, he is still proficient with magic he mastered in his past life, some of which seem to be very high-level spells as well. In other words, his magicule reserves may have dropped to around Rank B, but his overall power still cannot be underestimated. With his intelligence and powerful magic based techniques combined, we may have to find a better job to offer him.

But he still just looks like a skeleton from the outside...

Moreover, Adalmann's subordinates cannot be exposed to sunlight, nor can they talk. It may be ok to try and communicate with them, but it would be difficult for them to work in the town.

![exact fit image](image7)

We'll think about that later.

Anyways, right now we need to chat with him.

"---My most sincere gratitude to your grace for having granted me an audience---"

"Too lengthy!"

While I was planning out Adalmann's future, he had been expressing his appreciation of me the entire time.

He doesn't seem to stop even when ignoring all of his complements. So I have to raise my voice to shut him up.

It seems we have yet another intense fellow joining us.

"You are a promising fellow!"

The rest of the executives seem somewhat alerted at how satisfied Shion looks when she nods to Adalmann as well as how Diablo is looking at him with a gentle smile.

"Let's stop that for now, Adalmann. I know you are elated about the fortunate opportunity to have an audience with Rimuru-sama. But we are running short on time, so let's get to the point."

Had Shuna, who's also quite baffled, not stopped him, Adalmann would probably have continued with more of my praises.

His strong will has all been applied to his faith, no wonder he's so earnest. I feel strangely impressed within all this weirdness.

Next, according to Adalmann's explanation---

It turns out this Adalmann used to be in the highest echelons of the Western Holy Church, holding the position of Cardinal. At the time, the Western Holy Church was in a weaker state and wasn't as prominent within the Holy Empire of Lubelius as it is now. But we still learnt some detailed information on the organization.

First, we learnt about the Holy Empire of Lubelius as a nation. They are a theocracy that holds the God Luminas as their deity.

The pope acts as the spokesman of god, whose real identity is unknown. Perhaps the position is passed down over years, but there doesn't seem to be any rumors of such.

There is an organization named the Pope's Ministry that runs the country. This organization serves as the highest executive body within the Holy Empire of Lubelius. Adalmann recalls during his time, the Western Holy Church is but a lowly sub-group under the Pope's Ministry.

"The Western Holy Church was formed to promote Luminism. It is an organization that is specifically used to promote the religion. However---"

This alone was not able to ensure the personal safety of the missionaries. That's why the Pope's Ministry made demands to the nations under their protection and formed the Templar Knight Order. The nations welcomed the idea of a Ministry funded knight order, and so they agreed to assist.

It is a guarantee of the safety for citizens among these nations since now, the believers are protected from the threat of monsters. And since the funding comes from other people, anyone would normally agree to such terms. After establishing the foundations, disputes began to emerge between Lubelius and other nations. And it was then that the Pope's Imperial Guards entered the scene.

"In name, it's a military division, yet the members of the regiment only consist of a couple of people. They are all extraordinarily powerful individuals who have the authority to directly command the Templar Knight Order. These people only pledge their loyalty to their god and the pope, and so even the Archon, who possesses the highest executive authority within the Pope's Ministry has to be very respectful when dealing with them."

The archon seems to be the one in charge of political affairs. If the Imperial Guards wields such enormous authority to the point that power holders like the archon can't even order them around, then it is apparent that they are a force to be reckoned with.

"About that, my friend Albert also received the honor of being allowed to join the Imperial Guards, yet he declined to become my adjutant in the Western Holy Church instead. Later the pope granted him the title of Knight Paladin."

Adalmann smiled proudly as his skeletal jaws clattered.

I see, so that was the Undead Knight who even gave Hakurou a tough time---Now he has become a skeleton swordsman, it is no wonder that he has become so strong as he has received a monster's body on top of his masterful swordsmanship.

"---But the situation now seems to have taken a complete one eighty."

Oh, Adalmann isn't finished yet.

The changes do seem drastic according to his explanation.

The biggest difference lies in the fact that the Church has become much more powerful. Its authority has increased with the addition of the Holy Knight Order.

Moreover, the role of archon in the ministry is now given to a selected cardinal from the Western Holy Church, resulting in their greatly increased authority. The reason for which must have been the "Seven Luminary Clerics".

When Adalmann was around, the "Seven Luminary Clerics" were powerful figures rivaling the Pope, who also act as the archons. The Seven Luminaries initiated the changes of selecting the archon from the cardinals after receiving orders to revive the Western Holy Church. But the Seven Luminaries don't seem to be a group that can be easily dealt with. It seems that they are the ones who had set up the traps that eliminated Adalmann's party.

He seems to dislike the Seven Luminaries a lot.

The Holy Knight Order wasn't anything impressive while under the supervision of Seven Luminaries. They've only become an organization worthy of the name strongest knight order after undergoing Hinata's training. It is for that reason, the Holy Empire of Lubelius came to have the two pillars of the Pope's Imperial Guards and the Holy Knight Order.

"That was quite detailed, Adalmann. I see that you have a very good source of information despite staying with Clayman's this whole time..."

"Demon Lord Clayman sees an enemy in the Western Holy Church. He has been cautious of their forces and been diligently collecting information. I was a lieutenant under him after all, though he does not ask for my opinions, he would still give me information."

I asked out of doubt yet Adalmann answered while giggling.

So that's why, I get it now. It is quite unexpected, but Clayman's manipulative and calculative side actually helped us.

"Rimuru-sama, my God, please be extra cautious. Now that the Holy Empire of Lubelius has the Ten Great Saints, they are all individuals at the level of Sage. Even Demon Lord Clayman has treated those people with caution, please do not be careless."

As such, Adalmann's explanation concludes.

We were not informed of the details, but the Imperial Guards have members who are called the "Three Martial Sages", they are all masterfully skilled fighters who reached the level of "Sage". Apart from them, there are in total ten people including the six Holy Knights and their commander Hinata. They are known as the "Ten Great Saints".

Rumor has it that a "Saint" can rival the likes of "Demon Lord Seed". It is then no wonder why Clayman wouldn't dare act carelessly in the presence of these ten people.

It is likely that other than Hinata who is heading straight to our nation, the other four are also members of the "Ten Great Saints". That's why sending out normal troops would only cause unnecessary casualty meaning it's more appropriate to directly have myself and my lieutenants to deal with them. Moreover, judging from the movements of the Templar Knight Order, the Imperial Guards are likely on the move as well. This can be explained if we consider the "Three Martial Sages" to be acting independently.

"My God, I, Adalmann, was once a Cardinal. Allow me to go persuade this Hinata! I shall convert her into believing in Rimuru-sama as well..."

"Ah, stop right there. I don't want something like that, so you can go now."

The topic has gone down a weird path, so I began to hurry Adalmann out. This guy seems to be even worse than Hinata in holding onto beliefs without listening to how other people think. With these two as stubborn as they are, it definitely wouldn't be productive to have them talk to each other.

Then...

"I see, what a wonderful idea."

"Kufufufufu, I didn't even think of something like this!"

My secretary Shion and butler Diablo is quickly moved by his proposal.

"What nonsense are you two spouting! Things will only get worse if you try to convince her with idiotic arguments!"

These two are really tacit in a way.

Can I even describe them as being on good terms or not...

It almost seems that Diablo's frustrated look from before was merely an illusion.

I decide to bring the topic back on track after cutting short the idiot duo.

![soft scene break]

We are starting over again now that Adalmann has left.

Since we have gathered sufficient information, we can now begin our planning in earnest.

I'd really like some sacrificial pawns to probe our opponents' abilities, but that'd be too convenient n... Eh, Veldora has been glancing at me for a while now, but there is no way I can allow that. He'll no doubt overdo things by accident.

"Veldora, you---"

"Hmph! It is finally my turn to shine. I've got it covered!"

"No. I would like Veldora to be our last line of defense."

"What?"

"Doesn't that sound really cool, Veldora- THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE. I don't think I can trust anyone but you to fulfill this role---"

"Of course. Great minds think alike!"

Veldora nods delightfully.

Okiedokie, now we can prevent him from going berserk.

There is also no way we'd lose if we send Veldora out to battle, but it feels rather overkill. After all, how can I send out Veldora without warning when there's still a chance of negotiating with Hinata. But it would be different to have him as our backup instead.

After Veldora settled down, Benimaru begins to talk:

"First of all, we will have to decide on the reinforcements to send to Youm-san."

Hmm, Benimaru is acting more and more like a commander now.

He's gained much experience from his previous battles; he no longer displays his arrogance unlike Shion.

He is now able to examine and evaluate the difference in strength cautiously and intelligently.

*You can trust me as Generalissimo!*---I recall him saying that to me in the past, but now, he's become far more capable for the role than me.

But I would definitely be getting headaches if it were my responsibility. That's why, I hope Benimaru would continue to keep up the effort.

Benimaru begins selecting the forces to be sent out, with a suitably commanding voice.

Captain Gobta will command the one hundred soldiers of the Goblin Riders.

Additionally, Benimaru's direct subordinates, the four thousand strong Green Corps, and their 100 commanders, the Kurenai. The remaining two hundred members of the Kurenai would be tasked with defending town.

Lastly, Gabil will lead the one hundred soldiers of Hiryuu.

In total, four thousand three hundred soldiers will be dispatched as reinforcements for Youm.

"---As such. The defensive reserves of this town would decrease, but since there are the Beastman warriors and Veldora-sama, it shouldn't be an issue. Any objections?"

"Eh, are you really sending me?!"

"Is there a problem?"

"Ah, no. Never mind..."

Gobta was going to say something before he was silenced by Benimaru's strict glance.

What an idiot.

"Hakurou would be the commanding officer of the reinforcement troops. But rest assured, if anything happens, I will be at your aid immediately by using "Spatial Movement". But it is very likely that we will be engaging in combat with the commander of Holy Knight Order Hinata Sakaguchi. By that time, our communication may be cut, so everyone should listen to Hakurou's directions and do not overdo things on your own."

"Please leave it to me."

"Okay..."

"This time I'm definitely gonna show off a bit!"

Hakurou and Gabil seem very motivated. Gobta is the only one that seems a little uneasy, but he's good at going with the flow, so he should be able to manage just fine...

"I'm still a little concerned. Ranga, are you awake?"

I summon out Ranga who is sleeping in my shadow.

He's my bodyguard, but of late all he's done is sleep in my shadow. For some odd reason, his magicules have increased dramatically, and I worry he's lacking in exercise lately.

"My master, am I to be sent to battle?"

"Indeed. It'll be good for you to work out every now and then. Go with Gobta and protect him!"

"Yes sir. My body feels much lighter. I look forward to exercising after waking up."

What's that?

Things are going to go horribly wrong if I let him out! ---I suddenly get this dangerous feeling.

Never mind, since it's not me who will suffer the consequences. Things are probably going to go horribly wrong for the enemies.

"It's very reassuring now that Ranga-san is with me!"

And so Gobta is truly motivated this time. What a practical guy.

"Ranga, don't overdo things and accidentally kill your opponents..."

"No problem! Shion-dono has taught me the art of holding back!"

"I-I see..."

I'm even more concerned now.

I thought he has just been sleeping in my shadow this whole time, but as it turns out he's been up to no good when I wasn't paying attention. The fact that he mentioned he has learnt something from Shion makes me feel uneasy. But there shouldn't be a problem as long as we have healing potions.

At that moment, Ranga howls delightfully and lied down next to Gobta.

I can only pray for the safety of their opponents.

I couldn't help but cheer for the enemies who I've never met. "Good luck!" But I'll keep it a secret.

Benimaru doesn't seem to have any objections with my decision. Though, *you are spoiling Gobta too much*---seems to be what the smile in Benimaru's eyes entailed.

As such, I approved Benimaru's plan and the troops to be dispatched have been decided.

Now then, the problem now is those that will be reinforcing the new King's (Edward) forces.

"Then Diablo, how do you plan to deal with your attack plan?"

"Indeed. I've expected there to be reinforcement troops, but thirty thousand is a truly surprising number. According to the original plan, I only estimated the new king's total force to consist around ten thousand soldiers---"

Diablo continues to explain---

First, he instructed Edmalis to ask around and find out the reason the new king is gathering soldiers. Since he has assumed that the new king is only doing so as a precaution since he wanted to push the responsibility of the reparations onto Edmalis.

This way, the new king can argue that he has no need to fulfill the treaty signed by Edmalis. This method, although futile when dealing with the Council, lands on a grey area for dealing with us. He is going to execute Edmalis and claim the treaty to be invalid. And in doing so, when we are provoked to send out our troops, he will (then be justified in) gather the Western Nations to stand against us.

In order to prevent such things from happening, Youm's party has to go and rescue Edmalis, who has been trapped in this difficult position.

Right now, Edmalis is under Youm's protection and they are hiding in Nedler's territory. Everything seems to be going according to plan up to this point. Youm is using Nedler's territory as his base and has gathered a force of around five thousand men. In addition, I will be sending four thousand three hundred men all at once with teleportation magic. Not only are they almost equal in number, the sudden appearance of this huge army would also strike confusion into the enemies---We intended to crush the enemies using psychological warfare.

Now that the new king has gathered reinforcement, this tactic is no longer viable.

We waited quietly for our opponent to reorganize and now the situation has turned into forty thousand versus ten-thousand---Our opponents' forces have grown to be four times as ours. It seems we will need to hurry things up.

"---That's why the new king Edward has established his camp in Edmalis' domain in order to wait for the reinforcement."

Diablo's explanation concludes there.

The plan was supposed to be for us to defeat Edward in this fight and for Edmalis to announce his decision to continue abstaining the throne so the Hero Youm will be crowned.

"Right now, Edward has gathered around twenty-thousand soldiers. In three weeks' time, he will have gathered forty thousand. If that's the case, the lackluster defenses of Nedler's territory wouldn't stand a chance---"

Souei added on.

The situation would only get worse if we continued to wait.

If we send out our troops, it will become a real bloodbath. They've already lost twenty-thousand people before, and now with a battle like this, the Kingdom of Farmus would likely take a fatal blow.

Then, what should we do...

"---This is horrendous. Perhaps we should just give up this time. If I just forgo rest the of the reparations, then there would be no more war, right? They won't be able to continue the fight if they lose their justification."

"No way! They will look down on Rimuru-sama if we do that."

"It is indeed unsettling to be looked down on, but we have already profited from this whole ordeal. Shouldn't we aim to resolve the issue with Hinata first before rehashing our plans?"

In fact, we've already obtained parts of the astronomical reparations.

If we stopped right now it would still benefit us as the risks of continuing combat would be too high.

A Demon Lord is supposed to be the boogeyman after all^[In other words, if you can't scare the public, the title of Demon Lord is useless. That's why what Shion said makes sense.]---what Shion said does make sense...

"Kufufufufu, how can we abandon the operation now. Rimuru-sama, didn't you tell me to handle it?"

"Yes. But if possible, I'd like to avoid the deaths of innocents..."

"That will not be a problem. If that is what my lord wishes, your servant shall obey accordingly. It is but a simple matter for me to deliver on your wishes, Rimuru-sama."

The interruption of the take-over plan is due to circumstances after all, but Diablo doesn't seem to be deterred.

"What do you plan on doing?"

"I'll find the culprit---The person who wanted to pin all of these on me."

Diablo replied calmly.

Ah, he is furious.

" "Demon Extermination" ? If you intend to exterminate me, I shall play alone to the end. Some of the thirty-thousand men arriving soon are likely to be connected to the culprit. Why don't I try questioning them ***nicely***."

Diablo says so with a big smile.

Oh no, that doesn't sound nice at all.

Moreover, Diablo seems to be planning to take on the thirty-thousand Templar Knights by himself.

Maybe I should tell him to hold back---

"I see, then there shouldn't be an issue if it's you. But, don't go killing any innocent people understand?"

"Of course. I would never defy the divine will of Rimuru-sama."

Benimaru and Diablo got onto the same page before I could even make up my mind.

Not only that---

"That's good. Oh right, Hakurou, will you be able to suppress the new king's army without killing a person?"

"It should be doable. Although it would be much easier to kill them out right, but it won't give our soldiers a chance to train themselves."

"Right. Gabil, go prepare a large quantity of healing potions first."

"Understood! Leave it to me."

Eh? Eh eh!

Things are progressing, leaving me behind.

"Rimuru-sama, it seems that the plan to take over the Kingdom of Farmus is flawless."

"I-I see. So it seems... Good luck everyone!"

Shion started with a smile while I couldn't help but to just nod in agreement and give my approval.

" " "Yes sir!" " "

The motivated replies of everyone resonated in my ears.

Just like that they cleared away my hesitation. It is settled then.

![soft scene break]

Although there are still many areas of suspicion, our discussion moves onto a different issue.

That is who will be confronting on Hinata's party.

"Next, regarding the five individuals approaching our nation---"

Benimaru turns to me while speaking.

Yes, I shall lead the meeting this time!

As I plan to speak with confidence---Yet at that moment, Souei suddenly got up.

"Rimuru-sama, emergency report. The Holy Knight Order seems to be on the move---"

He explains nervously.

Everyone is panicking, or, maybe just me.

"What did Hinata's party do?"

"No, Nansou who was surveilling the Kingdom of Ingracia just reported that a hundred some soldiers just departed..."

"What did you say!"

"They are around half a day away from Hinata's party and will likely catch up to them at this speed. Their direction of traveling is the same, so we can deduce that they are heading towards our nation."

Hinata seems to be moving at normal speed without rushing. The four knights chasing after her seem to have traveled at full speed with magic applied even. But as soon as they rendezvoused with Hinata, they slowed to normal speed as well. The two parties seemed to have argued over something, but they ended up moving together anyways. The five are making their approach to our town as one group. As of now, they are making their way from the Kingdom of Ingracia to the Kingdom of Blumund, however, they are moving rather slowly, meaning that the hundred knights behind them will eventually catch up.

Yet the troops behind Hinata's party seem to be avoiding open roads, and it would appear they are abandoning their rides to take old forest paths.

"Sound like they are not planning on meeting up with Hinata."

"Their goal is unknown to us. We predict that Hinata would not be arriving in at least two weeks' time, and the troops behind her will be arriving around the same time as her."

Souei didn't forget to have someone to shadow them in midst of all this confusion.

I can only wait for follow-up reports on that.

Just as we've overcome one problem another emerged. No, I should say that one problem is followed by another.

How annoying, truly.

All in all, the situation has changed.

Sighing won't do us any good.

My executives begin to discuss again.

I listened to how they plan on dealing with the situation.

There are five individuals who are at the level of Sage including Hinata. There's also the hundred or so Holy Knights trailing them. This regiment of around a hundred knights are far more dangerous than the Farmus army of twenty thousand. Or rather, Hinata, in particular, is extremely dangerous.

This is the unchanging rule of this world.

The quantity of military force cannot rival the quality of individual strength. No matter how many thugs and lackeys you gather, you cannot win against the overlords of this world.

I don't intend to engage them alone this time, such act would undoubtedly be suicidal.

So, what should I do?

"Let's just stop thinking and kill them all!"

I'll leave the speaker of this statement unspecified, but really, whoever is the most airheaded is also the strongest.

Without considering practicality and going straight to the result.

It is because of this level of recklessness that her Unique Skill was awakened.

"If only Geld is here at time like this..."

"That guy has his own work to worry over. Unless things get really dire, we should just deal with it by ourselves."

Hakurou and Benimaru's exchange is very ear catching.

Could you stop being so stubborn and just ask Geld for help?

But there are only one hundred and so opponents. So it is meaningless to dispatch a huge army. And honestly speaking, my lieutenants will have to engage in battle anyway.

I will take care of Hinata while the remaining four would have to be dealt with by the others.

If Hinata is willing to fight me one-on-one then it won't be a problem, but for me to take on all five at once definitely would be a bit too reckless on my part.

<<Answer. There is no problem. The only opponent requiring caution is individual "Hinata Sakaguchi".>>

Oi...

No no no, that is the biggest problem of them all!

Are you okay? I feel like you are less reliable than the times of when you were still "Great Sage".

<<...>>

Essentially, the reason for my concern is that I don't wish for any casualty to occur. We are guaranteed victory if we attack the Holy Knights with sheer numbers to tire them out. However, it will be at the cost of heavy casualties.

It took everyone so much effort to survive till this day, it would just be dreadful to have a pile of casualties at this point in time.

However, our opponent is Hinata.

That woman is extremely dangerous.

During our last encounter, I focused entirely on escaping since taking her on seriously would surely lead to my demise. Besides, she wasn't even using her true strength at the time.

Right now, the only person who can deal with Hinata is me. I don't think I would lose if we are to duel each other one-on-one, but it's a different story if all the Sage level Holy Knights attack at the same time.

I would probably get myself killed if I pretend to be a guru and became too overconfident about my skill. Moreover, the other hundred or so Holy Knights are also a problem as well. I have no idea how to deal with them...

If Hinata came to negotiate, there's no need for her to bring so many troops. There is no way these suspicious events occurring would not cause others to be on alert.

"All right---I've come up with an idea! How about you let me try my dragon breath sometimes? I can make it look just like an accident by pretending no one was there!"

"Could you shut up for a moment? Last line of defense means you only get to fight at the last moment!"

Veldora's suggestion sounds like a child's prank, and so I reject the idea immediately.

If Hinata indeed came to negotiate with me, it would ruin any opportunity for us to talk. Moreover, there is no way of knowing what sort of damage his dragon breath would cause, how horrifying.

It would be fortunate for us just to not give Veldora any chance to fight. But if we intend to strike first and eliminate them, it would be a viable proposal. But it will still depend on what our opponents would do. Yet it is also not ok to just ignore them. Since there are more than one Holy Knights, there's a risk of them casting "Holy Purification Barrier" around us.

I can't simply ignore them, and killing them would also be a problem.

The Holy Knights---They are equivalent to the guardian of mankind. They are knights blessed with the protection of the spirits.

In this world, the damages caused monsters cannot be overstated and not everyone has the spare money to hire adventurers, which is why everyone lives in fear on a daily basis. The knights who protect these villages and towns on the fringes are those trained by Hinata herself. There are many who were saved from the monster attacks by them.

These survivors rely spiritually on Luminism, and physically on these members of the Holy Knight Order whose strength are also top-notch. Many of them are powerful individuals who exceeded Rank A. We will suffer serious losses if we directly confront these knights.

But that's not the main issue.

There will be consequence in the future if we were to straight up kill these knights who carry the prayer, hope and expectation of the weak. That is the main issue. We may still have room for negotiations if the doctrines of "Monsters are the common enemy of mankind" isn't a thing...

But I'm not giving up hope despite the difficulty of achieving it this time.

To them, we are evil creatures who cannot be reasoned with.

But these thoughts are not hard to understand.

After all, some of them are survivors from villages that were wiped out by monsters, or orphans whose parents were murdered by monsters. Being deceived would lead to their deaths and it wouldn't simply mean their death, but also the death of those who rely on them for protection.

Moreover, it is also a fact that there are still maniac monsters out there causing mayhem. The incidents of monsters causing harm near our nation has indeed decreased.

But there are still monsters being born in other locations and causing destruction.

If we are to kill all the Holy Knights here, who will be protecting those fringe districts? Upon thinking over it, I feel there's a need to avoid killing them so casually.

Perhaps we could have avoided this misunderstanding if I could have reached Hinata back then. It is regrettable that she wasn't willing to listen to me because I am a monster.

Since Hinata is a stubborn blackhead too.

She even went so far as to dispatch combatants after seeing my message.

<<Suspicion detected. Certain events do not seem like a natural outcome regarding the matter. It can be deduced that the Likelihood of this not being Hinata Sakaguchi's intent is extremely high.>>

Eh?

Could this mean that, we still have chance at negotiating?

There should be many ways for us to defeat them if they are truly considering us to be enemies. But right now, we are concerned about what's the right thing to do is since it is unclear how our opponents are perceiving us.

All in all, these are all excuses that I've been pondering over... But it is main reason for that is I don't wish to kill Hinata myself.

Shizue-san was also worrying about Hinata's later development. Since I've inherited her will, I don't wish to fight Hinata to the death without even talking to her.

How troubling, but I'm only so troubled because Hinata is too stubborn.

What am I worrying about, sheesh.

Regardless, if we can't negotiate, then a clash would become inevitable...

It will be disadvantageous for us if it comes to that.

Our opponents are experts in monster extermination. So we can't just bash our way through.

There is one thing that's for sure though, I hope to minimize casualties on both sides. It doesn't matter what our opponent wants, we will just have to prepare for the worst.

If the negotiation fails, I will have to fight Hinata once and for all.

I also mentioned this in my message, so there shouldn't be an issue with that part. Our opponents may be planning to have a grand confrontation with everyone they have, but this is our territory. If we are to set up a trap beforehand, we may be able to buy some time during my confrontation with Hinata.

Even though it is troublesome, it still has to be that way.

"Right, I've made up my mind! Let's set our goals on something further, we should do our best to prevent casualties in our fight with the Holy Knights."

If the negotiations fail---That's how I explained it to everyone.

Since the outline has been settled, everyone resumes discussion once more.

It would be meaningless to reduce casualties of our opponents at the cost of our own.

With that being the condition, everyone begins discussing our best approach.

The most effective way would be for me to reduce their morale by defeating Hinata. That's why I suggest for everyone to focus on buying time for me.

"In conclusion, we just need to cut them all down, right??"

"..."

"Just kidding."

Shion clears her throat after saying that.

Are you all right Shion? You impose a level of unease on everyone that is rivalled only by Veldora.

"All in all, we can't kill any Holy Knight, nor are we allowed to sustain any casualty on our side. That's how we should maintain the state of the battle. Rimuru-sama would take that time to take out the enemy leader, that is our battle plan, right?"

"Hmm, you're right. I'm so glad you understand."

She actually understood.

I was almost going to ask, "Do you have holes in your head?" which would have been embarrassing.

If Shion can understand, then everyone else should also be fine with it as well.

"If that's the case, I have an idea!"

Just as I was feeling reassured, Shion suddenly turns to me with a confident expression.

Unease, an unspeakable unease starts to drown my heart.

"...Let's hear it."

"Yes sir! My Yomigaeri also has around a hundred members. They wouldn't be outdone by their opponents, so allow us to take on those knights!"

Shion says with a proud expression on her face^[Doya kao (ドヤ顔) - google this to see examples].

"You idiot! The Yomigaeri only have strength of Rank C, the opponents would definitely think little of your skills!"

I really want to ask Shion where she is getting such confidence. Even if their number matches up, the difference in strength is night and day...

"---No, there's definitely a problem with Shion's plan, but the general idea still holds merit."

To my surprise, Benimaru interjected to defend Shion.

Here is how Benimaru sees it.

The Yomigaeri have the Extra Skill 'Perfect Memory' and "Automatic Regeneration", so average attack can't easily kill them. And considering how weak they seem; their enemies would not immediately unleash upon them attacks that are strong enough to damage souls.

"The Holy Knights may get careless at the fact of how weak their opponents are. If we can use that... It may be surprisingly effective in buying time."

He then gave this explanation seemingly pondering.

With Benimaru's explanation, it does make some sense.

If the Holy Knights are not directly attacking the soul, the Yomigaeri are at an advantage. They may have a better chance of settling things safely compared to other troops.

"Benimaru is most correct! Moreover, Rimuru-sama, they have all undergone my special training. "Pain Nullification" is a prerequisite, and besides that they have even acquired "Poison Resistance", "Paralysis Resistance", "Sleep Resistance". Everyone was successful in acquiring these skills! Just recently even Hakurou praised them as having invincible endurance."

With Benimaru's support, Shion actively made her proposal.

Hakurou is nodding in agreement too, so her words don't seem to be made up.

"By the way, how did they acquire those resistance?"

"Oh, that's---"

Although I don't think they were lies, it is best for me to double check by asking. And the result of the answer is quite surprising.

She requested Kurobee to craft weapons that can induce abnormal status. They naturally learnt these skills after training with these weapons. She didn't spare any sympathy since her subordinates are not easily killed. And since it's difficult to arrive at a definitive result by attacking each other till they're completely immobile, that's why the winner of their unique simulated battle is whoever remains standing in the end...

"Rimuru-sama, if we find that the Yomigaeri are in danger, I'll send my Kurenai to assist then. Will there be an issue, Gobua?"

The tall Ogre beauty who was guarding the door came in upon summoned by Benimaru. Kneeling, she bows first to Benimaru, then to me.

It is said that this beauty named Gobua is the captain of Kurenai.

She's definitely one of the goblins I named, though now she looks nothing like a goblin. Dressed in a dark red military uniform, she is truly an elite.

At Benimaru's prompting, she gallantly looks at me as she replies:

"Yes sir! I will not lose to Shion-sama. My subordinates and I have trained harshly for this. Please allow us to demonstrate our prowess on the battlefield."

She has a pair of sharp eyes and a powerful stance.

Her power is also above Rank A.

Her power rivals that of Souka, perhaps even above her. It seems that Benimaru has also trained some subordinates not to be underestimated.

"They may not be as strong as the Holy Knights, but my subordinates are nonetheless skillful. By having two of them to take on one enemy each, we may even be able to buy some time for the Yomigaeri to escape."

"Nonsense! My subordinates and I alone are enough to take down those Holy Knights!"

Next, it's quarrel time between Benimaru and Shion.

Both of them are very motivated.

I think it would be all right to leave things to her care.

"Good, then I'll leave things to Shion. You are Gobua, right? I'll be relying on you for cover!"

"Y-yes sir! Leave it to me, Rimuru-sama!"

Gobua replies blushing, seemingly excited.

It's great to see how motivated she looks. But honestly, I hope they won't have a chance to fight.

"Shion, unless our negotiation fails, do not engage with the enemies no matter what!"

"No problem! But if the enemies tries to pull any dangerous stunt---"

Indeed, that would be a different case.

I almost forgot; my original intent is to stop them from building the "Holy Purification Barrier".

"If that happens, you're free to do whatever's necessary. Just be ready to act as soon as I give the confirmation via 'Telepathy Net'."

"Understood."

Shion nods in satisfaction.

Benimaru then orders Gobua to go back to guarding the gate.

All right, now the only question remaining is---Who's going to take on the "Sage" level knights.

![soft scene break]

We've decided to have Shion's Yomigaeri deal with the Holy Knight Order. Benimaru's Kurenai would be on standby just in case of emergency. These three hundred soldiers would engage the one hundred Holy Knights.

I'll have to have faith in them, and now it's time to decide who will be taking on the other four traveling alongside Hinata.

That is under the precondition that we even have enough candidates to take on "Sages" ---

There's me, Veldora, Ranga, Benimaru, Shion, Souei, Geld, Gabil and Diablo.

Hakurou might not have sufficient magicule reserves to match them, but he can still put up a fight with his sword skill.

Shuna... Is hard to say. It may be different if it's a magic battle, but the enemies are knights who are skilled at melee combat, so it will be challenging for her. The sages of the "Ten Great Saints" seem to have power to rival the likes of "Demon Lord Seed". They would have power to at least rival the Orc Disaster. It would be quite the heavy burden to place on Shuna.

---Based on the previous assessment, there are in total ten people including Hakurou.

I will be Hinata's opponent.

Veldora is a no go. I would like him to defend the town, besides it will be dangerous if he starts rampaging. And to be honest, it is necessary for us to tighten our defenses considering that the enemy force may have others operating without us knowing.

Geld has been reserved only to be summoned in an emergency situation. So, we should avoid calling him back.

I hope Diablo, Ranga, Hakurou and Gabil will focus on resolving the issue at the Kingdom of Farmus.

The rest would be---

"The only ones free to be deployed are Benimaru, Shion and Souei... Just these three, huh?"

There don't seem to be enough people to set up a one-to-one combat scenario.

All right, what should I do now...

"That's without saying, I'll also be joining the fray."

It is for this reason that Benimaru has handed the commanding position of Youm's reinforcement to Hakurou, so we will have to include him.

"I'll stay as well. I can leave intelligence gathering work to my "Clones". Besides, right now, Souka and the rest are quite useful in this regard as well."

Souei should be fine too.

He is very capable, so keeping up with information collection would unlikely pose a problem.

"I want in too! As Rimuru-sama's secretary, I should be serving at his side---"

Shion jumps in to stake her claim just as someone suddenly interjects with a voice within my body.

<<Report. If the secondary party also contains members of the "Sage" class, it is possible that the goal of buying time will not be achievable. The group to engage them should be arranged properly as well just in case.>>

Oh no, so there is that to be concerned about as well.

Thank you for your pertinent opinion!

Once again Wisdom King-*sensei* is indeed reliable.

I have to confirm with Souei first anyhow.

"Hold on, Shion. I have something to ask Souei. Are there any "Saint" level knights among the Holy Knights operating separately from Hinata?"

As I ask, Souei momentarily closes his eyes.

He then answers somewhat upset: "My apologies, every member is indeed above Rank A, but there isn't any individual emitting any particularly stronger aura---"

As soon as a monster releases its aura, it becomes very obvious to tell.

Yet more skillful individuals can hide their auras cleverly.

For instance, Hinata only gives off the aura of an average person. I wasn't able to see through her disguise and was thus surprised by her tremendous strength.

Right now, there is no way I can tell unless they engage in battle.

"But shouldn't we still act with caution, I hope Shion would oversee her troops. Apart from Yomigaeri, how about we allow Shion to command the Kurenai as well. Is that okay with you, Benimaru?"

"If it is how Rimuru judges it, I am fine with it. As for the four knights coming alongside Hinata, it will be fine for Souei and I to each take on two at once."

How confident.

Souei seems to also agree with his calm and non-caring look.

"A moment please, Rimuru-sama. Occasionally, even I, Rigurd, wish to go on a rampage!"

Rigurd proposes as he shows off his muscle.

"If that's the case, there is still me."

Shuna smiles as she says.

But you're not suited to melee combat, are you?

I think it's too dangerous to send you.

"And me as well, how could I let Gobta take all the spotlight!"

Rigur is also all pumped up.

Rigurd and Rigur are indeed now stronger than the point of surpassing A-rank, yet they are still a long way off from "Demon Lord Seed". It would be too reckless.

"Ah ah, hold on. It would be too dangerous to send you guys out."

"But, are there any more suitable candidates?"

"We alone are sufficient."

"Benimaru-sama, I know you are both very strong, but should you look down so much on your opponents? It would be better to have me and Rigur---"

And so, the discussion grows more and more intense.

It may lessen my worry to grant them their wish, but I still want to resolve the issue cautiously. In order to reduce the risk to zero, it will probably be better for me to have Geld come back when the day comes---

I ignored the unresolved quarrel in the meeting and started to ponder, but I was interrupted by the noise outside the gate.

"I've told you that there is an important meeting going on---"

"Hush, we want to join as well!"

"It's fine, Suphia, but don't be so rude to others. Young lady, we only wish to express our gratitude by offering our assistance."

The voices just now came from Gobua as well as the Beastketeers Suphia and Alvis.

The two entered the room as the gate opened.

"Hey, sorry to interrupt. Just now I saw that skeleton dude come by, so what is happening here? Please allow us to contribute as well, Rimuru-sama."

"Demon Lord Rimuru, we apologize for our sudden visit. Suphia may be quite rude in tone, but she truly wishes to help. I hope you would grant us two the opportunity to repay you."

Suphia and Alvis says while approaching me---more accurately kneeling down next to me.

Gobua intended to stop them but was halted when Benimaru raised one of his hands. Then he left his seat and came to stand in front of me as well. Without me noticing, Diablo is also standing between them to prevent the two Beastketeers from getting closer to me. Benimaru should already trust them, yet he still isn't permitting them to approach me.

As for Diablo, he has no trust in the two at all. He seems prepared to eliminate Suphia and Alvis as soon as I give the order.

The two contrast each other, yet they are on the same pace.

Suphia and Alvis seem to also be aware of how rude their requests seem, so they are not complaining about their treatment.

"Benimaru, Diablo, stand down."

"Yes sir."

"Understood, Rimuru-sama."

Taking advantage of the time when the two are returning to their seat, I pull out seats for Suphia and Alvis. I again started the meeting once everyone has calmed down once more.

"Just now you mentioned about assisting us..."

"Yes, Rimuru-sama. Aren't the "Ten Great Saints" approaching this nation? You seem to be short on people that can hold them back, so we wish you would allow us to assist in this task."

"Yes! I am only of much use in battle. It is times like this that I may repay my gratitude. Please give us the order!"

I begin to examine the two's proposal.

The two are powerful enough, but, if my order led to their harm, it would be embarrassing to face Demon Lord---ex-Demon Lord Karion.

"But you shouldn't be acting on your own without Karion's permission."

"That's okay! Karion-sama is very generous in that regard."

"Besides, Karion-sama is also troubled by how to repay Rimuru-sama. We will get scolded for not intervening at a time like this."

Hmm---Honestly, their proposal came at the right time. With these two present, I can also be reassured with our fighting force.

"I agree. These people are trustworthy."

Benimaru doesn't seem to object.

"Will you be helping to take out people who interfere with Rimuru-sama when I'm not present?"

"Yes, please leave it to me."

Shion and Suphia seem to be on good terms as the two reach common ground quite quickly.

It seems there is no objection.

"Can I rely on you guys?"

"Leave it to us!"

"Thank you for your understanding!"

I still can't get over how motivated Rigurd seems, but I do hope for him to stay back in the town and lead everyone.

After all, I'm worried about sending him out to battle too.

And as such, we've gained the powerful assistants in the form of Suphia and Alvis, now then our plan to take on Hinata's party is settled. The outline of this plan that isn't even worthy of being called a battle plan.

All of my executives are now brainstorming to check for any oversights of this operation.

I on the other hand, close my eyes to predict Hinata's movement once more.

The calculation of Wisdom King Raphael-san has also predicted that this plan would minimize casualties, so I don't think it warrants anymore concern. But there is something I am still worried about. It would make a better battle plan if I abandon the operation to take over Farmus or by calling Geld back. But I didn't do either and adopted the current plan out of my own selfish thoughts.

That's why I need to ensure it is a perfect plan that guarantees our victory. It will be no problem if Hinata is willing to negotiate. If not, we will duel each other until one of us falls.

This plan may seem to be waterproof with our arrangement, yet it has one fatal flaw.

If I am defeated by Hinata, all of these discussions would be worthless.

However, Wisdom King Raphael-san thinks I will be the winner.

With that being said, if I am defeated this time, our operation would be completely blown.

Would the calculation of "Wisdom King Raphael" be truly reliable?

I always have the feeling that it is too confident...

Rather, it has too much faith in me.

Raphael-san, are you overestimating me too much? ---I always have such uneasy feeling. However, I will have to force myself to charge onward.

Just like I did until this point, and how I will in the future as well.

Even if do not have one hundred percent confidence in myself, my companions still believe me.

If that's the case, I will no longer hesitate and keep on moving.

"I'll say this one more time. If the battle plan is hard to maintain once we actually start fighting, then you should eliminate your opponent immediately. The lives of our companions are the most important. Know that you are done for if you get killed. So, I hope everyone will be able to make it through this ordeal safely as well!"

" " "Yes sir!" " "

It would be counterproductive if we get any of our companions killed trying to avoid harming the Holy Knights.

I have to get this point across.

Seeing that everyone has responded, I nod with satisfaction.

Next.

We wait for Hinata's next move---

![hard scene break]

Hinata has successfully arrived at Tempest Federation.

The journey has been just average traveling after teleporting from Lubelius to Ingracia through the "Teleportation Gate". Since there is no replacement for her horse, she had to stop to rest frequently.

She packed only the bare minimum in terms of luggage as she is used to military marching.

She only brought her horse, and a sleeping bag that also contains convenient tools such as emergency rations or pots.

It is winter at this time of year.

Although the snow isn't heavy enough to block the road, it is still not a good time to travel.

Soon after Hinata set off for the journey and ran into four of her subordinates.

She heard the sound of running horses behind her and turned to see some familiar faces.

They are the four captains, Arnaud, Bacchus, Ritase and Fritz.

Vice-commander Renard needs to stand on guard while Hinata is out. Meanwhile, it will also be problematic to deploy all of the captains to chase after her, and so the five decided over a lottery draw and Garde was determined to be the one who stays with Renard on guard.

Leaving behind the two who seemed to be frustrated by their duty. Arnaud and the rest set out to catch up with Hinata.

"---You guys, what is the meaning of this?"

"That should be our line, Hinata-sama. Are you trying to take all the glory for yourself?"

"What kind of dumb talk is that? I'm heading to negotiate, there is no glory to be claimed anywhere."

"Here we go again. You are not particularly persuasive when dressed up as if you are heading for a final battle."

"That's right. We wouldn't want to gain anything at the expense of Hinata-sama's life. Our true honor would be in you leading us."

"That's right. The Demon Lord's message never mentioned that you have to go alone after all."

Her subordinates bombard her with arguments.

Hinata, surprised, replies while a sigh:

"Are you all aware of the situation here? My opponent is a Demon Lord. It was I who provoked him in the first place, so this is my problem. It is neither your responsibility nor is it any business of yours. Return home immediately."

But, even with Hinata's order, Arnaud and the rest would still not obey. Hinata eventually gave up and said "Whatever you wish then" to allow them to accompany her.

Now Hinata's party has increased to five people.

Though the roads are somewhat well maintained, they are still rugged, as such, their journey continues slowly.

In this time of the year, most inns are fully booked, so there isn't any place for them to rest. As a result, they are forced to camp out in the wilderness.

Although they didn't run into any monsters, the piercing cold of winter coupled with sad meals consisting solely of emergency rations made this journey a taxing one on both the mind and the body. By the tenth day of their journey, they finally reached the Kingdom of Blumund, far more exhausted then they had expected to be.

At this point, Hinata's party decided that they had to seek out an inn for some desperately needed rest and recuperation.

![soft scene break]

"By the way, this town seems has really grown hasn't it?"

They each reserved a room for themselves before they met up in the restaurant.

Arnaud broke the silence immediately saying so.

"Indeed."

Hinata agrees as well.

Ritase did report about this, yet it has become obvious how drastic the difference is when seen with your own eyes.

As they were getting dressed and settling down in the inn, they started to observe the demeanor of the streets. The whole market is full of energy despite it being winter.

There are even items unfamiliar to them on the market. The rural atmosphere Blumund gave off in their past missions have long disappeared.

"Have you all seen this? There are even more varieties of clothes. They look like brands I've only seen in the Kingdom of Ingracia, there are even some passers-by wearing those luxurious clothes!"

"Speaking of that, it's the same case for weaponries. All of the gear here seems to be crafted with monster materials, making them of very fine quality."

Arnaud and Bacchus both found such sights to be astounding.

Indeed, although these gears are not comparable with the ones used by the Holy Knights, the commodities of this town have exceeded both the quantity and quality of those in other small nations. There are also plenty of trading posts around.

Normally they would shut down during the winter days, making the scene here particularly strange.

They are operating because there are customers.

In other words, there are still many merchants and adventurers passing through this rural town despite the winter days.

"It must have been the effect of the Tempest Federation...?"

Fritz asks while observing Hinata's expression.

It must have been because this kingdom is trading with the Tempest Federation that such a town was able to develop. He couldn't think of another reason besides that.

But it would mean that their actions are completely ignoring the doctrines of Luminism.

"They took a gamble to trade with a Demon Lord in pursuit of development---"

Ritase also mumbles with confusion in her eyes.

But to be honest, Hinata also agrees with her view.

Normally it would be impossible.

*But he* is different.

If it was Rimuru, her fellow countryman, he might have made such things a reality.

The evidence is---the menu hanging on the restaurant wall.

"Can I take your order?"

As soon as the waitress of the inn asked, Hinata replies without hesitation.

"I want ramen."

"So, you would like to order ramen! It has been really popular lately. We have three different flavors of ramen, miso (fermented bean), soy sauce and pork bone^[These are common broth flavours for ramen, will be referring to them as their english names except for Miso (since it's quite common).]. Each of them also have the two choices of heavy and light broths, how would you like your ramen made?"

There are in total six variations.

It would seem that Hinata wasn't overthinking, the ramen here is exactly what it should be.

"I want thick-broth pork bone ramen with dumplings and rice."

"All right! You are quite the expert for a first-timer. What would the other guests like to order?"

The rest all look at Hinata impressively after she made her order without any hesitation.

"Ah, I will...have the same thing."

"M-me too..."

"Hmm."

"Same here."

Arnaud and the rest have no idea what any of these are, so they'd rather follow along and order like Hinata.

"Hinata-sama, what is this thing called ramen?"

"Surely you would know what that is, right?"

"Yes. But, about that... You guys may not be used to eating it."

" " "Ehhh!" " "

Hinata's words made the crowds feel unease.

"Oh, don't worry. I'm just trying to say you probably are not used to it, so the method of eating may be quite hard."

Hinata is only concerned that Arnaud and the rest would not be used to using chopsticks. Yet they began to worry about whether the cuisines are terrible or not.

And soon the dishes are served.

Hinata felt a sense of nostalgia, while for the rest, it is their first time seeing authentic ramen.

Hinata pulls her hair up to prevent it from falling into the broth and splits up the disposable chopsticks^[Wooden chopsticks that can be splitted in pair to use. Usually only serve one meal before disposed.].

*They are even using disposable chopsticks.*

What level of extravagance are they up to---Hinata thought to herself.

How did they manage to promote disposable chopsticks to the restaurants of a neighboring country in such a short time? Hinata couldn't help but wonder. Yet the bowl of warm ramen is right in front of her.

"Thanks for the meal."

She puts her palms together while whispering. Then she slowly lifts some hot broth up using the soup spoon and drinks it.

It's the thick pork bone broth. She has no idea how it was cooked to recreate the thickness of the taste.

It is then that the noodle she intended to put in her mouth touched her lips, making Hinata gasp with a sound of "Tsk".

Arnaud and the rest immediately react after seeing this.

"Is it poisoned?"

"Are you okay, Hinata-sama?"

They all rise up to express their care.

"Hush. Shut up and eat your food."

She scolded her subordinates before putting the noodle on the soup spoon and slowly blowing her breath on it.

Hinata doesn't want to scald her tongue.

Such action is somewhat cute considering how it contrasts her cruel appearance. Although she herself didn't notice since she's been focused on tasting the noodle.

The noodle is both tasty and chewy. The delicacy of the thick pork-bone broth has all been imbued onto the noodle.

It is a most exquisite and delicious cuisine.

A sensation that Hinata thought she would never experience again is beautifully recreated.

She falls silent and only concentrates on eating her ramen.

Arnaud and the rest, rather terrified, observes Hinata dining.

Then they begin to try out ramen by imitating her.

"...Agh! Hot!"

"It's delicious! What is this really?"

"The broth tastes great too!"

"Eh, is this some trickery?! How could food like this exist..."

The four clumsily used the chopsticks to start to challenge this food named ramen fearfully, yet have given unexpected reactions.

To them, whose main diets mainly consisted of stale bread, salted soups or raw vegetable salads, this unknown dish called ramen has brought them an astronomical amount of shock.

The most appropriate words to describe this sensation would be---Taste revolution.

Then again feeling confused, they turn to the rice Hinata ordered. It also accompanies ramen quite well. The more you chew on it, the better it tastes, slowly filling them up.

There are also dumplings.

As soon as they take a bite out of the dumplings the fragrance of the ingredients immediately assails their nostrils.

The rich variety of ingredients in the dumpling transforms eating into a concert of taste, which forms a perfect duet with the rice.

"Amazing! This is so tasty!"

Arnaud praises.

It is no wonder the food tastes so good considering the party has been eating field rations until yesterday.

Eventually, there is only one more dumpling remaining on the plate.

Fritz's chopsticks began to drift toward it...only to be deflected away by Hinata's with a *clack!* sound.

"Fritz. *That* is mine, I left it there to eat it last. It is mine...and I **will not forgive** you if you take my love."

Fritz feels a chill up his spine as a paralyzing aura of murderous intent envelops him.

![exact fit image](image8)

"S-sorry, it's so delicious, I just unconsciously reached for it..."

"Just order another plate if you didn't have enough."

Hinata, baffled, replies and only to be shocked at the sights of the four all putting down another order at the same time.

Yet their wishes cannot be granted.

"Ah, we are sorry, dear customer. That was our last serving."

The waitress replied with the cruel truth.

Ignoring the couple bystanders who were forced to learn this hard truth, she approached Hinata's table and continued:

"In fact, this is a new item that only started being sold last week. This is actually a secret, but this dish was created to satisfy the cravings of the Demon Lord-sama. Myourmiles-sama, who owns this establishment, has personal contact with that Demon Lord-sama and has secured exclusive trading for this. So far, it hasn't sold well because it is both difficult to eat and expensive... But it's becoming famous for making anyone who eats it even once addicted to it!"

The waitress informs them on the supposed secret. Yet given how loud she spoke, everyone in the restaurant would have heard the conversation.

Hinata suddenly realizes that this whole conversation was probably planned from the start in order to promote this dish.

By doing so, the number of recurring customers will increase along with the total number of customers. In this way, they can mass-produce dumplings to make it a lasting item on the menu.

Now everyone in the restaurant is looking rather intrigued at Hinata's party. They are all observing the food Hinata is eating just like how Arnaud and the rest initially reacted. Perhaps they are planning to order those food items for themselves next time.

Hearing the waitress' words, Hinata finishes drinking up the soup.

"Thank you for the service. It was delicious."

She then pays the tab and rises up from her seat.

She does so while seeing her subordinates downing the soup in a panic.

"Oh, don't get all flustered. I'm only going back to my room. And by the way, you will get fat if you drink all of the soup as well."

Someone suddenly pauses upon hearing that. It's Ritase.

"Ehh, but... Hinata-sama also..."

"My body's disposition is just so that I don't get fat easily."

You have my warning---Hinata leaves after saying that.

Ritase glares back at her jealously, but Hinata, who wishes to sleep now after a full meal doesn't even want to look back.

![soft scene break]

The next morning, the party embarks on their journey once again.

They are all in excellent condition after getting sufficient rest.

Now that they've restored their energy, the harsh roads leading to the Jura Great Forest would not pose an issue.

"Let's go."

At Hinata's order, everyone resumes their journey. Yet their spirit (to confront hardship) soon disappeared.

"What on earth is this."

"This is so comfortable to the point of becoming stale."

"That's not true, the point is this road! It is paved so beautifully that it can rival the roads in the capital of Ingracia! No matter how you look at it, it doesn't make sense!!"

There is no wonder why they are so surprised.

The roads have been covered with stone pavements, there aren't even any puddles. The road is designed with a slight curvature where drainage side ditches are installed below.

The journey has been very pleasant since the road is not blocked by snow.

"Speaking of which, there isn't any monster aura at all. Though we're in a forest, there's few signs of monsters at all..."

Said Ritase recalling the investigation of the area she did and her findings.

Just as she mentioned, the barrier around these roads are indeed a wonder to behold.

There is magic device installed every ten kilometers or, so which is used to connect a magic barrier that prevents nearby monster from intruding.

The safety of traveling has thus been elevated, leading more merchants to travel in and out. The reason for the prosperity of the Kingdom of Blumund must have been due to the gathering of all these merchants.

"I wonder, given how much work does it take to pave all these roads, and what would the monster kingdom look like."

No one can give an answer to Arnaud's question.

Everyone held a similar view to his, all eager to find out the answer.

"I had heard from merchants that one could even go there on horse. To think it was true..."

"Indeed. I thought horses would only be a nuisance when going into the forest It turns out to be an unnecessary concern."

Hinata couldn't help but feel astounded after seeing it for herself even though she was already informed of the mega projects commissioned by Demon Lord Rimuru. After all, the Jura Great Forest that has once been hard to access for outsiders has now become such a convenient travel destination as if it was just a simple hike. There is no wonder that she feels astonished.

The party continues their journey by horse.

Soon they spotted some hobgoblins riding wolves approaching in front of them.

"Have we been revealed!"

"Hold on, it doesn't seem to be the case."

Seeing that her subordinates being alarmed, Hinata calmly corrects them.

It turns out she is right.

These hobgoblins seem to be chatting very casually. You can even hear laughter coming from them. They also seem to have spotted Hinata's party due to a good field of view. The hobgoblins raise one of their hands and approached in a friendly manner.

"Howdy, I've never seen you before. You don't look like merchants, are you all adventurers?"

"Yes, that's right."

"I see, I see, in that case, good luck on your job. By the way, I'm sure you guys will be fine on your own, but you should keep some things in mind."

This hobgoblin switches his tone as he continued.

He then starts by explaining the rules of the road.

Littering is not allowed.

Brawling on the road is not permitted.

If you need to set up camp, there are watering holes available for use every ten kilometers apart.

There are also outposts^[The term used here is more like police station, but outpost is fine as well] every twenty kilometers apart, it will be safer to camp there.

If you have the budget, there are inns every forty kilometers apart.

If you see anyone in trouble, you need to contact the nearest outpost.

And on and on.

"By the way, please do not touch the glowing stone tablets set every ten kilometers. The punishment for damaging those things is severe."

Those glowing tablets are magic devices used to maintain the barrier. They glitter when mixed alongside the stone-paved road and can act as waypoint at night.

*Are you really monsters?* The level of detail in the briefing would truly make that hard to believe.

"All right, we understand. Thank you for your caring inform."

"Don't mention it. People like us are patrolling the area precisely to help anyone in trouble."

These Hobgoblins are the members of the security force in charge of patrolling. They promptly left after saying those words.

Hinata's party stayed on the spot to see them off with bewildered looks.

"Eh, Hinata-sama..."

"Wait, settle down. I need to think for a bit, so could you please stop talking for a while?"

Hinata silenced the rest and started pondering.

Afterward, having quietly traveled onwards for an hour, a watering hole came into view. It was exactly where the hobgoblin said it would be, down to the kilometer marker.

In order to showcase the current location, there are sign posts set every kilometer to display the traveling distance starting from zero at the west gate to the capital city Rimuru. It becomes very clear how many more kilometers you would need to travel in order to reach a water source, outpost, or inn.

Hinata knows she can ensure the party's safety by relying on these signs after seeing how the road (Highway) is constructed. She can immediately tell from the signs where to retreat when she needs to back up.

It just goes to show that Rimuru genuinely cares for the travelers' and has already done much in ensuring their personal safety.

By the way, the units of measurement in this world is different from his original world. Yet Rimuru has ignored that in order to mark the road in ways easily understood by himself.

Kilometer is set by pegging the average travel distance with the estimate of an hour's walking to cover five kilometers. Thus, the reason why the inns are prepared one every forty kilometers due to the assumption that travelers can move eight hours a day on foot. Since horse carriages move at around the same speed as those on foot, they would also be able to rest at inns if they slow down a little. The whole trip was thoroughly planned out and thought through with very clear intent.

It has become quite the obvious fact that Rimuru hopes to coexist with humans. There really isn't anything left to doubt. The journey since departing the Kingdom of Blumund has all been very comfortable.

The drinking area contains a directly drinkable water source that seems to be free for the public's consumption.

Hinata almost fainted after seeing this.

Free water---Applying such Japanese ideal in a dangerous place like this, it is a bold and crazy enough move that even Hinata wants to make fun of (roast).

There are also cooking spots for campers and even squares for the convenience of setting up tents. Some locations have sets of long benches made of log wood with roofs to provide cover during rainfall.

All of these resemble a campsite.

The divine realm of Jura Great Forest once inaccessible to humans, is now a harmonious venue easily accessible to everyone.

There are many different monsters residing in the Jura Great Forest. It is a dangerous place where adventurers below Rank B may easily lose their lives if they are not careful. It is not supposed to be a place for human residence, but a paradise for the monsters.

*I can't believe he has developed this forbidden land so it's accessible by everyone*...Hinata didn't even once consider the idea. It is not a matter of whether she can achieve it or not, but something which is beyond her imagination.

Not only for her, but it must have been the same for her fellow countryman Yuuki Kagurazaka.

When they are striving hard to protect mankind by distancing them from the threat of monsters, yet someone just suddenly comes along and---*What kind of joke is this*. It's normal for Hinata to think this way.

*---But, at least now I understand what he meant by his words.*

Hinata's thoughts wander to the past.

It was at a cafe in Ingracia that Hinata likes a lot. There she was doing the regular intelligence exchange with Yuuki. It was then that she heard the rumors about Rimuru.

Rimuru seemed to be serious about developing the monster kingdom. Not only that, he wished to find the best way to create friendly relations with the Western Nations. An example of his method is the recently introduced Brandy Cake. This dessert is only made possible thanks to the alcohol that Rimuru made easily commissionable.

"Anyhow, that person is really different. Should I call him having his cards hidden or not. He seems to have a much grander vision in the long term than us. That's why including acts such as making delicacy like this, he has been doing all of them very seriously."

Yuuki said to her with a wry smile as Hinata was enjoying the delightful taste of the cake slowly eating it bit by bit.

He then advised her that making an enemy of Rimuru would not be a wise move. It was implying that the Freedom Association would be on Rimuru's side. Back then Hinata didn't take his words seriously nor did she imply it, but up to this point---

*---Indeed, if he doesn't have energy to spare in spades, there is no way he could have had the energy to plan such things.*

Hinata thought to herself as she observes the merchants using the water source with thanksgiving.

Two hours passed after they left the drinking area.

They encountered their first inn. It is said that there are seven inns in total on this road, this one being the seventh.

Hinata and the rest decided to rest there for the night.

The party gathered at the restaurant.

"All right, everyone. Let's hear what you all think."

Hinata begins her inquiry.

Arnaud spoke up first while also representing everyone.

"I want to give my genuine opinion here, is it okay?"

"That's the type of view I'm looking for. Speak then."

Hurried by Arnaud answers:

"Just from seeing these roads alone, I think that Demon Lord Rimuru is a wise ruler. These roads guarded on patrols makes this path feel safe so it's no wonder why so many have gathered here. The trade routes through the Kingdom of Farmus will no doubt start to fall out of favor (when competing with these)."

Next is Bacchus, he answers solemnly:

"Hmm, the monsters are not the only things to be afraid of. There are also bandits who would attack caravans, incidents when people get injured or sick or when the carriage breaks down to immobilized travelers etcetera. Such issues would never cease to occur. But with more people flowing in, there would probably be less concern for such things."

"The fact alone that you are in an environment where you can expect help during these hardships is already very reassuring."

"It's the same logic when it comes to monetary expenses, there is no longer a need to hire a large mercenary band. That's all..."

As Bacchus finishes, Ritase and Fritz both nods in agreement.

Most of these have been complements of Rimuru.

"He spent more time managing the country than most trashy vassal lords. Rather than Demon Lord, it'd be more suitable to call him a wise king."

"Indeed, there's a lot that can be learnt from him. Our nation of Lubelius should also make use of these designs."

"Thank goodness that we have yet to label him as the "Nemesis of God"."

"Next, we can only hope that Demon Lord Rimuru is willing to accept Hinata-sama's apology..."

Hinata nods to them, showing her agreement.

"I can only try to apologize with sincerity. But if my apology alone is not sufficient and that Demon Lord Rimuru still wishes to duel me, I will have no choice but to accept---"

However, Hinata is still rather confused.

Why would Rimuru wish to duel her at this point in time? Even if he cannot forgive her for what she has done, there is no need to start a fight solely on that basis.

Perhaps he hoped to demonstrate to her his power after awakening as a Demon Lord---Or something along those lines. But Hinata doesn't think Rimuru is someone with such vulgar thoughts.

With skepticism in their hearts, Hinata's party continues to journey on without much challenge.

They found residence in another inn on the seventh night of their journey again. The level of luxury there has come to rival the top-grade inns in the Kingdom of Ingracia.

There is even a bathhouse to wash away the tiredness of traveling.

Yet the inn's staff always contains a number of Blumund citizens. The monster staff seem to be learning techniques related to monetary transactions and they are often seen being instructed around the human staff. It is a reflection of the ideal coexisting relationship between humans and monsters.

It is a sight that it alone could cause Hinata to re-evaluate the doctrine of Luminism.

They will be arriving at the capital city Rimuru tomorrow. Surely, she will be reuniting with Rimuru there once more.

*I hope we can avoid conflict and have a good talk together.*

Although it is but a one-sided thought, it is her sincere wish.

However---

Being tangled in a web of malice, her wish will not come true.

![hard scene break]

Hinata will be arriving tonight as planned.

In a span around two weeks, she has only used normal means of traveling to come here without using magic to shorten the trip.

Souei's subordinates quickly returned with this information.

"Impressive, it is most important to get hold of information early. I'll be relying you folks in the future as well."

"No, such feeble matter is not worthy of your praise. We will be striving to improve our skills."

Souei calmly accepts my praise.

He is truly worthy of the name "Shadow" ^[Referring to the kanji of Souei's name, 蒼影. The second kanji means "Shadow".].

Handsome people (Bishounen) simply can't be faulted in doing anything for being so darn cool.

But speaking of that, Souei also made the horrifying proposal: "How about we eliminate Hinata now by poisoning?"

What sort of stupid idea is that! I said and immediately rejected it.

Hinata doesn't seem to be coming for a fight, meaning there is still room for negotiation.

However, I cannot get careless.

She's been checking in at every inn she ran into and didn't rush through any part of her journey. Everything she done thus far seems too conscientious.

"Could it be that she is trying to divert our attention?"

Benimaru asks.

Has she made herself the open bait while having the other troops launch an assault?

That is indeed a possibility.

She is Hinata after all. From the cruel appearance she gives off, she seems to be the type who would do anything in pursuit of victory.

"What are the movements of the rest of her troops?"

"Yes sir, they are still on the old path in order to hide their movements. Had we not noticed them from the start, we may have never discovered them."

This other troop seems to be planning some kind of military operation.

Thinking along that line, Hinata is likely acting as a bait indeed.

Regardless, I can't get careless. Shion has already deployed her troops, if they are to strike, the situation will probably go downhill very quickly.

"There's nothing strange about using Hinata as bait considering her strength. Even Benimaru at this stage will have a hard time confronting her, so only I can be her opponent. I guess she probably thinks that we still don't stand a chance, even when engaging her together."

"Huh, how arrogant. To bear such ignorant thoughts after having already encountered Rimuru-sama once, the only thing you can only call them is foolish."

Says Souei with a slight smile and emitting a dangerous aura.

It's ok, the only one who knows how strong Hinata is, would be me prior to my evolution.

Looking back, I can clearly see that Hinata wasn't going all out at the time.

"If a fight really breaks out, it will be really bad if their other group spreads out. The situation will deteriorate even faster if they manage to erect the "Holy Purification Barrier"."

"Indeed. Then we will contact Shion to have her eliminate the enemies as soon as possible---"

Souei agrees with Benimaru's views, but he pauses midway through his sentence. Then---

"Rimuru-sama, they seem to be on the move and spreading out around the town. Shion has gone to intercept them and have engaged in battle."

---That's the worst possible news. I had hoped I would not have to hear that reported to me.

Has it come to this? Hinata has chosen to fight after all.

It can't be helped then. If you wish to antagonize us, we will have to proceed as planned.

![hard scene break]

Hinata's party left the inn to prepare for their continued journey.

Everyone shares a tense expression as they are about to reach the capital Rimuru at night.

"We are finally arriving. I don't know whether we can see him today, but everyone calms their minds. Please refrain from engaging in battle even if we end up fighting."

"But..."

"This is an order. There is no need to continue being hostile towards Demon Lord Rimuru. Wait until we finish our duel, and then we will engage in a friendly negotiation---"

As Hinata tries to remind everyone of the plan, she was quickly cut short.

Someone is trying to reach her urgently through magic.

"---finally reached you---nata-sama, can...hear me? "Three Martial Sages"...engaged in battle---"

The transmission is intermittent and barely managed to even link up.

The person making the call is one of Hinata's trusted subordinates, Nicolaus Speltus.

His tone sounds urgent, yet the constant interruption and pauses make his message hard to interpret, almost as if the transmission is being disturbed.

"What is it? What's going on?"

The transmission is cut before Hinata is able to send her messages through.

"Beware of the Seven Luminaries ---"

With this one final warning from his side, signals from Nicolaus soon ends.

Hinata is shocked at the realization that there must have been an issue.

*Has he tried several times in informing me of something and was only successful in the last transmission? If that's the case, the actual incident must have occurred earlier. The "Three Martial Sages" has engaged in battle... Could it be that they were partaking in the civil war in Farmus---!*

Hinata's face turned pale as she quickly attempted to contacts Pope Louis through "Magic Communication".

"What is it? Your mana is disoriented, are you in a rush?"

Louis responds with his normal casual tone.

Aside from feeling reassured about that, Hinata answers:

"Yes, I'm running out of time. So, I'll be straight with you. Did you send out the "Three Martial Sages" ?"

"What? I've not given such an order. Do you mean that they have been on the move?"

"Yes. Since you have no interest in human society, with Luminas-sama's orders and my reminder telling them to stand down, they shouldn't be moving about on their own. There must have been some change in the situation."

Louis and Luminas are only interested in managing the Night Garden, leaving Hinata to hold all the actual authority (in human world).

Although the "Three Martial Sages" oppose her at times, they do not dare to defy Hinata's orders. So, they shouldn't be acting on their own once they received the instruction not to. It would then mean, something has gone wrong. Perhaps someone has bewitched the "Three Martial Sages".

*Is it the Seven Luminaries ---*

Her ominous prediction has turned into reality, Hinata makes up her mind on the spot to return to Lubelius.

Using teleportation magic is much more efficient. Although she planned to preserve her stamina before the battle with Rimuru, but now's not time for such thing.

Hinata concludes, yet it's already too late.

"That's probably the case. Then I'll be---"

With a sound of crack, Hinata felt a blunt pain crossing her mind as she discovers that her communication with Louis has been forcefully severed.

A form of force field has enveloped the surrounding to prevent usage of magic.

At the same time, an enormous amount of fighting aura bursts out to shake up even the air.

"How the---? This aura, is it Renard?"

Arnaud, who has been observing Hinata this whole time suddenly exclaims in astonishment.

Hinata couldn't care less about it. As the commander of the Holy Knight Order, she immediately restored her spirit.

"Let's move!"

Something is happening.

And it's definitely not something good, things have taken a turn for the worst just as she was going to get in contact with Rimuru.

Feeling anxious, Hinata rides forth to the battlefield at full speed.

![hard scene break]

After noticing that Hinata has established contact with someone, we decided to intercept her before anything else. And soon Hinata began to ride at full speed to the battlefield. It seems that I am successful in crashing her conspiracy before they were able to succeed.

But now we can confirm.

"It seems that this has indeed been Hinata's scheme all along."

"That's about right. I can only praise her as an expert, seeing how quickly she changed her plan after the original scheme was exposed."

Benimaru nods in agreement to my view.

"Then we shall proceed as planned. I shall duel Hinata until one of us is the last man standing."

"Understood! We will not allow anyone to interfere."

"All right, please hold back the enemies. Move out!"

" " "Yes sir!" " "

I nod to reassure Benimaru and transform into my human form.

The team consists of myself, Benimaru, Souei, Alvis, and Suphia.

"I wish your triumph in your conquest!"

Shuna says to send us off, and so we move out as planned. I steel myself before activating "Spatial Domination" to reach Shion's whereabouts before Hinata. Although Shion has guaranteed victory, it must have been quite difficult to fend off the Holy Knight Order with Yomigaeri alone.

---Or so I thought.

I can't understand the sight before my eyes.

My brain is not processing fast enough.

How in the world did this happen!

I'm speechless at the sight before me.

So, what is in fact happening here---

~~Shion is fucking dead again.~~

Shion has taken charge and is commanding the Yomigaeri.

This is good, since it's going according to our battle plan. Yet it is the state of their battle that is causing my shock.

It has gone so well that it has far exceeded my expectation.

"H-how is it possible! Why are our attacks useless against them!"

"But they are not undead, what is going on?"

The Holy Knights exclaim.

In place of a verbal response, the members of Yomigaeri scratch the Holy Knight with the small knives in their hands.

They used their body as bait to sneak in their attack on the stronger Holy Knights. It is an impressive move, possible only by using their undead characters.

But that is probably as far as they can go. What follows should be the overwhelming one-sided victory of the Holy Knights who will finally get serious... Yet I couldnt have been more wrong.

The Holy Knights were in shambles in less than three minutes.

As I have predicted, the Holy Knights who are no longer careless began to chase down members of Yomigaeri one-sidedly. Yet situation is quickly changed. Due to the difference of their strength, I thought that they couldn't possibly win through being unkillable. That's why I designed the plan for them to hold back the enemies.

But as it turns out, the Yomigaeri completely recover from even severe injuries while the Holy Knights begin to fall to the ground one by one.

The fallen Holy Knights are quickly restrained of their actions by Kurenai.

"Ehehe, Holy Knight-san. My knife here is applied with strong hypnotic, a lot of them! Even a single scratch would guarantee our victory!"

The eyes of the petit child-like soldier meet with those of the Holy Knight as she explains to him. Shouldn't you refrain from explaining this type of things to the enemies? But it can't be helped since she's still a child.

<<Announcement. Individual "Gobwe" is older than individual "Gobta". >>

Are you kidding me!

I see, the biology of monsters is truly difficult to understand. Gobta didn't have much change in his appearance despite his evolution. Perhaps he will turn out to have some drastic changes in the future.

Regardless, let's put that aside first.

Right now, the hilarious sight of a little girl lecturing a Holy Knight is unfolding before my eyes. It would seem the Yomigaeri are in fact, not struggling in battle, but mastering it.

Unless the knights were cautious enough to have prepared antidotes or possess "Poison Resistance", they will always be defeated by such assault. Even though it may only be used once, it's still a very effective method.

However, we can't just stop here.

The other knights arriving wouldn't dare to be careless and charge in with their full force. Such trickery will no longer be easily pulled when confronted with such an overwhelming difference in strength. It has already become useless after being witnessed by others.

Our soldiers only managed to land a scratch when they struck while their opponents were tricked into believing that they've struck a fatal blow. However, I would give them the highest commemoration for having retired half of the enemies with just a scratch. They truly did a great job.

Next according to the plan, we are supposed to engage in a protracted battle--- Yet my idea is completely turned around again.

Shion suddenly points with her chin.

In front of her are Gobjay and Gobua; The two look confused and turn their eyes to Shion.

"Are we supposed to join as well?"

"Eh! Are you not going? We few alone would not be enough to beat all those strong looking guys..."

"No, that's why, we don't have to win the fight, all we need to do is to win some time---"

"Eh eh? But I remember the order she received was to win no matter what?"

Gobua knew the content of the meeting.

Even though she was only guarding the gate, the voices of our meeting must have crossed through. Gobjay seems to be hearing about this for the first time as he looks at Gobua with his eyes wide open in shock---Are the two at cross purposes?

"Eh, aren't we told to be on hold after the meeting...?"

Perhaps fearing that Gobjay would go on and on about the meeting, Gobua asks Shion.

That's true. I thought it was strange too, but thankfully I didn't seem to be wrong.

Yet Shion suddenly raised her volume to scold:

"Are you two idiots? Can't you see that victory is close at hand? You can only exceed your limits by challenging and triumphing against the strong. You should be grateful for this opportunity I've granted you."

That's a weird expression from Shion...

The victory is close at hand despite the fact that the enemies are stronger than us. That sounds quite contradictory.

Yet Gobua is moved by her words. Her eyes switch to a different light with a maniacal smile across her face.

"You are most correct; this is indeed the case. Such great opportunity shall be taken by us Kurenai !"

And so, she quickly accepts Shion's proposal.

Gobjay on the other hand...

"A-about that... Aren't we defying orders that way?"

He asks Shion while shivering.

"Why are you still here? Or perhaps, do you wish to choose your preferred path between doing as I said and becoming my new test subject (to eat my food)?"

How awful, poor Gobjay is forced to comply under Shion's intimidation.

But it is not up to him at this point, and so Gobjay rushes panicky into battle.

...No, you did nothing wrong.

But, how strange. For some reason, it almost seems as though the fault is on Gobjay.

Gobua is very aggressive in battle and easily instigated as expected from being Benimaru's subordinate. While Gobjay may look dumb, he always does his job very seriously.

He should just keep the things he wishes to ask to himself. Spilling them out will always land him in hot water. But he hasn't discovered that he has brought this upon himself. I suppose that's a form of joy in itself, so I don't intend to interrupt.

"...Is this okay, Benimaru?"

"It's not really okay, but I'll consider it training in dealing with unexpected things. Especially since Shion has a keen instinct. She would only give such an order when she knows there is a chance to win."

I couldn't help but ask while Benimaru answers me with a shrug.

Indeed. It is out of fear of losing that I ordered them to buy time as much as possible. But there wouldn't be any need to hold back if they can paralyze the enemies without getting hurt at all.

Since I'm now on the same page with them, I focus myself on the battlefield.

Next comes an authentic exchange of offense and defense.

The Yomigaeri members pair up to confront the remaining fifty Holy Knights directly with a member of Kurenai supporting each pair. If they are to fight with all they have, the Kurenai would be defeated by the Holy Knights. But, the difference in their strength is not so desperately different.

While the Holy Knights may have achieved Rank A, they are only at baseline for the Rank. In contrast, the strengths of Kurenai are approaching Rank A. They can probably make it with some assistance.

Moreover, the members of Kurenai are taking turns. The members who are taking care of the injured are exchanging shifts with the tired members. And since we have healing potions, this cycle of switching would continue infinitely.

"By the way, their combat abilities are really impressive. I didn't expect such individuals to exist in this country."

These words came from Alvis.

She is commenting not on the Kurenai, but the Yomigaeri.

They all possess powerful undead bodies on top of having good combat endurance.

"Indeed, they are hard to deal with. It seems decapitation alone won't be able to stop them, that would make them hard to take on even for me."

Suphia shares the same sentiment.

They both seem to think the Yomigaeri are difficult to deal with.

Even I was surprised.

The Holy Knights are not taking turns in fighting. Our victory is not a dream if things continue like this.

"It's just that it isn't according to the original plan..."

I tacitly agree.

And looking at Shion---

She is observing the battlefield with a satisfied look while licking her lips with her tongue.

The watery tip of her pink tongue exposed momentarily gives off a seductive luster.

Shion turns around to look at our location. She seems to have spotted us as she gives off a smiley face. She was just looking at Gobjay with a devilish expression, which is farfetched for anyone to imagine she could put up a smile on her face right now.

"Rimuru-sama, everything is going according to plan!"

"No way! We never planned these stunts in our meeting!"

"Thanks for your praise!"

"I wasn't praising you..."

"Then, it's about time for me to go!"

Shion finishes her sentence before thrusting her feet against the ground to launch herself out like a bullet.

"Eh, where are you going...?"

She ran off without answering my question...

![hard scene break]

She is sprinting at full speed.

Hinata is sprinting at full speed across the narrow lanes of the forest, with her perception enhanced by the spiritual force hosted within her.

At an empty space with few vegetation, she spots five Greater majins. They seem to know that Hinata is approaching, yet they are fixing their eyes afar. Hinata also turns herself to the direction of their eyes. The things Hinata sees are the sights of her proud knights being beaten to a pulp.

She really wants to smack her mouth out loud, but Hinata endures. She is not angry at the fact that they are being defeated, but that her opponents have chosen to completely antagonize her men.

Since the battle has already started, there is no more chance for negotiation. It would be irrelevant to Rimuru now even if Hinata tells him that they have reason for doing so.

Rimuru isn't averting his eyes from the battlefield. And Hinata naturally remains stationary at her location as well. She is analyzing the strength of her opponents while planning ahead.

There are in total four powerful Greater majins. In addition, a woman in suit that is giving off an abnormal aura.

The two women at the front seem to be Beastmen. The relationship between Demon Lord Rimuru and ex-Demon Lord Karion was mentioned in the report before. Deducing from this, the two should be from the famous Order of Beast King's Warrior, the Three Beastketeer. They give off a style of the strong and power that average majins could only dream to reach.

However, the two persons standing next to them are not by any chance inferior than the Beastketeers. Moreover---

One of them is a handsome red-haired man with a pair of dark horns. The other majin stood in contrast to him is a blue-haired youth with a single white horn grown on his forehead.

"The Three Beastketeers! And Orges---No, are those Kijins?"

Arnaud caught up to Hinata and lowered his volume to ask her.

Hinata continues quietly observing the majins without giving a response.

"---No. They are Youki (Fair Oni)."

"Are you saying they are Youki?"

"I've heard of them. Those are monsters possessing mighty strength to rival that of the Earth Deity. Some heretics seem to even worship Youki as god..."

"In fact, they seem to be an evolved version of Kijin. It's rumored that only few were able to reach that realm. But they are right here before our eyes. We should assess their threat as Special Rank A."

This is the domain of Demon Lord.

Hinata and her men are unwelcome guests Arnaud is and the rest are well aware of that as well, and they are all experiencing nerve-wrecking stress.

Back to Hinata.

Threat level of Special Rank A---*We may in fact be underestimating their strength by that ranking.*

Especially that red-haired majin, he seems to possess strength to surpass "Demon Lord Seed". It's best to send out three captains including Arnaud in order to stand against him. Yet right now there are four majins in total with only four captains on her side. It couldn't have been a coincidence, and so she interprets this as Rimuru having intentionally paired up the fighters.

And last but not the least---Demon Lord Rimuru.

The overwhelming presence of him is nothing like the feeling he gave to her in the past.

"I shall be your opponent. Come and duel me."

Hinata recalls the line.

*Yes, that is the case. You hope to duel me alone and not be intervened, was that what you meant?*

Then she will take this as the worst possible scenario and hope that her own life can be sacrificed for Demon Lord Rimuru to spare her subordinates.

*No, that's not right.*

She is going to triumph, and then ask Rimuru to accept her apology.

Hinata makes up her mind.

At this moment, the female majin in a suit begins to move out. While giving off a powerful oppressive aura, she targets Renard far away by launching herself out with a jump. As she launches out, Rimuru's eyes slowly fall on Hinata.

It is at this moment, Rimuru and Hinata's eyes meet---

![hard scene break]

Seriously.

I really want to say this, since everything is within my prediction.

There is no issue at all.

So, I turn my head to the back.

Hinata is standing right there.

She has a calm look with her breathing smooth as well. Both of us are observing the battlefield.

Our eyes soon meet.

We stood there staring at each other with silence for a while.

Then I speak up first:

"You've really done it now, Hinata. It goes without saying that this is my territory. It is obvious that you all bear ill intent towards us. I'm not so generous as to allow you to strike first."

It doesn't really matter who struck first. Once they open the "Holy Purification Barrier", we will definitely be defeated, that's why Shion had to take the pre-emptively attack. It'd be barking up the wrong tree to be condemned for striking first, so I warned her beforehand.

"Yes, that's to be expected of course. I don't know why Renard defied my order either."

Hinata answers without hesitation or shame.

How obvious.

"How dare you. You've obviously planned to pin Rayhiem's death on us, haven't you? Now the whole deal has fired up the new Farmus King's faction."

"Killing Reyhiem...?"

"Yes. The same Archbishop Reyhiem that you summoned. Just to be clear, the only thing I did to Reyhiem was to give you a message through him."

A confused expression flashed through Hinata's face, but from then on her became expressionless almost instantly again as if she could put on a perfect poker-face at will. She gazes at me coldly, seemingly trying to assess my strength.

Her face is indeed beautiful, though it comes embedded with a ruthless outlook.

"Is that so? I see."

Hinata mutters to herself.

"You did receive my message, right?"

"Yes. I did."

"And is this your answer then?"

"Yeah, I suppose...it's not quite exactly how I intended, but you wouldn't believe me even if I were to tell you, would you?"

Just what exactly is she getting at?

"It is possible for me to believe, but it comes with one condition, you must halt your regiment and send them back home."

I finish my sentence while pointing towards the enemies that Shion is engaging.

Hinata follows to the direction of my hand, but then shakes her head slightly.

"It's too late. Before I could stop them, their fight would have already come to a conclusion."

That's indeed true.

Is he called Renard? It seems that the strongest knight is fighting against Shion at the moment.

There is another one there. Although he is not as strong as Renard, he is still a force to be reckoned with.

Both of them are probably part of the "Ten Great Saints". Shion is displaying her fighting prowess having them both as her opponent.

I can't stand it, but since the situation has developed to this point, I can only leave them to find out who's stronger. It makes me somewhat upset to admit that Hinata is right, but now the demand I gave seems pretty hard to achieve.

Then, a young knight suddenly interrupts:

"What nonsense! If we were to withdraw our forces in this situation, what would happen to Hinata-sama? *You* are the one who called Hinata here, who's to guarantee that you won't harm her!"

He shouts angrily after hearing my words.

The way you put it sounds to me like that you never intended to negotiate peace with us from the very beginning...

"Shut your mouth. The only ones allowed to speak here are Rimuru-sama and Hinata Sakaguchi. We never called for you to come. Be a bit self-aware and behave yourself."

"What did you say?"^[I've lost count how many times Arnaud has said "What did you say" in this volume. But it's a lot]

Benimaru came forth to stop the young knight, yet he doesn't seem to be complying.

The next second, two flashes of slashes suddenly cross in front of Benimaru.

Benimaru easily blocked the hit as this knight called Arnaud struck out.

"Your attack didn't bear any killing intent. That was the right call. Had you intended to kill me just now, you'd already be dead."

"That's because I don't wish to interfere Hinata-sama's negotiation. I didn't expect such reaction from you considering that was supposed to intimidate you only. But then again, it really doesn't feel good to be misjudged."

"You are the one who is misunderstanding."

"Hehe, how about we sort things out on the side."

"Very well."

A gentle smile emerges on his face that contrasts with the veins popping on his forehead.

This Arnaud guy is easily provoked.

As such, Benimaru and Arnaud soon go on away.

This Arnaud is the strongest among the four apart from Hinata. That's why Benimaru acted out. He would probably be going as planned to only hold Arnaud back by sparing his life.

Hinata only observes the scene in shock without intervening. She can tell that Arnaud is weaker than Benimaru, yet she didn't stop him.

"Well then, aren't you guys bored as well? So as not to get in the way of Rimuru-sama, why don't you all have some fun with us."

"Yeah. I want to find out how strong the "Ten Great Saints" are as well."

Alvis and Suphia make their moves.

Perhaps this is what they have always intended.

If I recall correctly, Suphia is quite the battle manic.

"Then, I'll take you on."

"It can't be helped; I'll keep you company then."

They respond, and soon the two pairs of people depart.

The sole female^[紅一点 (koitten) - lone female, i.e.: rose among the thorns] knight and Souei are the only one remaining at the scene.

"Shall we?"

"I suppose."

Did those two read the mood? They also left the scene.

Everything has been departing from our original plan.

I mean, you guys didn't at all need to go away. Apart from Benimaru's pair, it's as if the other three have all go on dates.

You guys don't need to force yourselves to fight you know...

But speaking of which, my opponent is female as well.

And the most beautiful one.

But I don't feel any joy at all...

---Jokes aside, there indeed won't be any interference now.

At the end of the day, these are probably all destined to happen.

And so, I confront Hinata once more.
