# Interlude: The Secret|Meeting

Adjacent to the territory of the Kingdom of Ingracia and the Kingdom of Farmus sits a small kingdom facing towards the North Sea. This kingdom is known as Siltrosso.

A secret meeting is being held here---one that will shake the foundations of history.

"And, what happened in the end?"

"Everything is proceeding as planned. Our scheme has yet to be exposed."

"Hehehe, and people say that devilish woman was smart. It turns out she's quite average."

"However, we must not get careless. Even considering her strength alone, she's still the strongest person in the West."

"Hmm. But I'd urge everyone here to keep in mind as a lesson that we were able to make a fool of her just by pulling a few tricks on that brawn-head General."

Since the freezing wind from the sea keeps this nation bitterly cold all year long, there is a large fireplace to keep the room warm.

The five elders have gathered here.

Their garb and accessories are all extremely luxurious.

Some of them are even wearing the silk finery made of the Tempest Federation that is rarely seen in the market.

All of them are equipped with magic defense items as accessories to completely shield themselves against magic.

That alone speaks of the wealth possessed by the elders.

And of course, this room is completely espionage-proof.

It is also strong enough to withstand Nuclear Strike Magic.

In addition to all that, the room is guarded by extremely strong Rank A knights.

Alongside the elder sits a woman with her legs crossed. She is Glenda, the wild beauty with eye-catching curly red hair.

"Turbulent Sea" Glenda---member of the "Three Martial Sages" and one of the Ten Saints.

Her real employers are the five elders, the so-called Five Great Elders, the leaders of the Western Nations.

One of them wears a pure white, loose robe. His eyes are sharp and resemble that of an eagle.

His disheveled hair gives off an immense imposing pressure; however...a doll-like cute girl is also sitting on his lap.

She has smooth blonde hair and pink lips. It's a gentle-looking young girl around ten-years-old.

A formidable old man and a cute young girl; it's only natural to deduce their relationship of grandfather and granddaughter. Yet something appears rather out of place in this scene. However, no one questions this. It is simply deemed as natural as it is to the likings of the old man.

Since after all, this elder sitting in the center is the head of the Five Great Elders, leader of the Rosso Family---Granbell Rosso.

The Rosso Family.

The family that built its strong roots in the Western Nations and owns all authority.

They also happen to be the royal family of the Kingdom of Siltrosso.

The members of their family had a hand in every powerful nation, including the likes of Farmus and Ingracia.

It was also their family's contributions that led to the creation of the Western States Council.

To the outside world, it appears that the Council elects its members from every nation. But they are, in fact, mostly members of the Rosso family. And their increased presence grants them enough prestige to surpass powerful nations.

Yuuki Kagurazaka's funds to found the Freedom Association also came from the Rosso.

If anything, these elders could be considered the rulers of the Western Nations.

And their leader is Granbell.

No one dares to object his actions.

Granbell pats the girl's head as he speaks majestically:

"That would be good. But Damrada-dono, your lies seem to have been exposed."

He points out with a smile.

He is referring to the news Glenda has brought back that Hinata has found out that she was manipulated.

The man who responds is called Damrada.

He is fully clad in black with the edge of his hat covering his face. His clothes seem to possess a classy texture.

The type of clothes he is wearing are uncommon in the West; they give off an exotic feeling. But that is hardly odd, considering Damrada and his men are not from the Western Nations in the first place.

"Hehehe, don't worry. Hinata Sakaguchi may no longer trust us, but we've gained more that we lost. That is your trust, Granbell-sama."

"Surely you jest. The goal of "The East" is to cause chaos in the West, so you can get better weapons sales. Are you not planning to have the empire attack after we exhaust ourselves from in-fighting? Your talk of trust is laughable."

"Impressive, impressive. I've been exposed, as expected from Granbell-sama."

"Are you not going to deny it?"

"That won't help anyway."

"Huh, you do talk the talk. Regardless, let's get to the more important matters."

"Sure."

"Am I right to say that it is our shared goal to eliminate Hinata?"

"Of course. The biggest obstacle that keeps the empire from marching onto the West is no doubt the "Storm Dragon" Veldora. Our sources have pointed out that the Demon Lord Rimuru has allied with that evil dragon. We can't be sure of the authenticity of these rumors, but the situation confirms that the evil dragon can be negotiated with. If that's the case, we'll try to communicate with it. The next obstacle that poses quite the threat would be the Western Holy Church. As long as that organization exists, the Western Nations will be united. If that's the case, no matter how powerful the empire is, it would be difficult to take all of the Western Nations down..."

"Oh? Are you suggesting that we don't deserve your concern?"

"My, where'd that come from? The Five Great Elders are all *practical* people. When the Empire takes hold of the Western continent, I hope you will continue providing us with your assistance. Let's collaborate and manipulate the world economy in the dark."

"Collaboration? Do you want us to the pave way for the empire? Quit joking around."

"Hehehe, but the Empire is quite strong! It may be hard to attack the West, but there is still a chance we will succeed. Do you wanna make yourself an enemy of us when that happens?"

"How dare a mere arms dealer be so rude to Granbell-sama?!"

Surprisingly, it was Glenda, not Granbell, who reacted furiously.

She takes out her otherworld weapon from her pocket---a pistol and points it at the eastern merchant Damrada.

![exact fit image](image6)

But Damrada remains calm. His calmness isn't because he is ignorant of the danger of the pistol. It is precisely because he knows its power that he is able to remain calm.

"Hehehe, a pistol, then? Bless my eyes. These things can even be found in the West now too."

Damrada speaks without surprise or fear.

"Oh, so you know about it? But why are you so relaxed then?"

"Of course I'm relaxed. You really think that otherworlders are only in the West? We arms dealers should naturally know all sorts of weapons. Besides, the one you are holding is nothing but a common piece that has been successfully mass-produced."

Damrada answers uncaringly.

The Five Elders couldn't help but express shock at this revelation.

"What did you just say? You are already mass-producing this?"

"As expected of merchants from "The East". That's impressive."

"If that's the case, the empire's army would be strong beyond any measure. It may not be effective against monsters, but it is an invincible weapon against humans..."

The Elders all express their surprise.

Granbell also begins to consider Damrada's words.

This man called Damrada never lies.

To be more specific, he often creates misunderstanding when he displays the opposite reactions to the magnitude of things he discusses. This man cannot be underestimated.

To put it in another way, as soon as you scrutinize his words, you can find the devious messages hidden within.

This time Damrada is warning them not to stand against the empire and that there are still plenty of benefits in collaborating.

" "Practical" was a good compliment. You are right, it is in our interest to play along and assist you."

The rather imposing words of Granbell calms the Five Elders.

"Is it really okay, Granbell-sama?"

"Stand down, Glenda. We've shared a common goal from the start anyway. It is not time yet for us to stand against them."

One does not defy Granbell's decision. Glenda stands down obediently.

In view of the pros and cons, Damrada's words do make sense.

Damrada's men are arms dealers, they do not want conflict with the Rosso who wish to control politics through economy. The two parties may oppose each other in terms of interest if the situation changes, but that's an issue for another day.

"Hehehe, that's some wisdom I'd expect from Granbell-sama. Although we'll inevitably become enemies one day, right now, we're comrades."

"Indeed. We don't wish to disturb the balance of relationship between Farmus and Ingracia. As long as some forces are present, the two sides can be on equal footing. We have no idea why Demon Lord Rimuru took down Farmus, but it would be problematic if the land is taken by the Demon Lord."

"That's right, I totally understand. We're in the same boat. It's so damn annoying how the trade route from Dwargon to Farmus has now been taken. And our previously ideal trade partner, Demon Lord Clayman-sama was also taken out. Demon Lord Rimuru is a thorn in both our sides. Please let us help. With that being said---"

"Right, that seems to be the case. Hinata has followed through with Demon Lord Rimuru's wish and has gone to the Monster Kingdom herself. Now we only need to provoke the Demon Lord to let him take revenge on Hinata."

"That's a well-thought-out plan. But speaking of which, why do you want to eliminate Hinata Sakaguchi anyway? In my opinion, it's better if you just manipulate that saint..."

Damrada looks towards Granbell as he finishes, likely trying to guess his thoughts.

Yet Granbell did not flinch and laughs it off with a question.

"Huh, the reason is simple. It's all because that woman is too strong. Her title as the strongest knight of the west is not just for show. Even when you compare her to heroes such as the majin Razen, head of Freedom Association Yuuki or Shinning Yuusha Masayuki, that woman is still somewhat stronger. Aren't you trying to use us because you thought the same way? Am I wrong, Damrada-sama?"

"Hehehehe, ara, Your Grace is indeed fearsome. You must mean to take out the pawn that cannot be dealt with or controlled. Makes sense."

Granbell and Damrada exchange looks and nod at each other. The two have similar personalities. That's why they can understand each other just by doing that.

Then the two begin to discuss their duties as if nothing happened.

Damrada agrees to take care of the demon that's been conspiring within the Kingdom of Farmus.

On the other hand, Granbell orders Glenda to mobilize the Templar Knight Order from the neighboring nations around the Kingdom of Farmus and assist the new King Edward to push Edmalis, who's been supported by the Demon Lord Rimuru, to a desperate spot.

They will then leak the rumor that Hinata has marched on a crusade to eliminate Demon Lord Rimuru to curtail Rimuru's actions.

Rimuru will be unable to send reinforcements to Farmus if they're on guard against the Holy Knight Commander Hinata. And once the Demon General that's been leading the scene has been taken care of, the remaining party of Hero Youm will be easy to deal with.

Then the troublesome Hinata herself will probably be taken care of by Demon Lord Rimuru.

"But, what if Hinata Sakaguchi actually succeeds in slaying Demon Lord Rimuru? What'll we do then?"

"That would be nice too... But be reassured, that Demon Lord called Rimuru is not like the others. We must take out this threat while we still have the chance. But right now, he has allied with Veldora, so it won't be easy. I'll try to negotiate with them later."

"Hehehe, I'm counting on you then."

"Right. I'm in fact, counting on you with this one; don't fail in taking on that demon."

"Certainly not. You'd think the Western Holy Church has experts against demons, but "The East" has a far more effective special department for that."

"That's good."

"Then, we'll head out first, do excuse us---"

Damrada bows after Granbell nods, and then he leaves the room.

Now only the Rosso Family and their guards remain.

After confirming it's all their own in the room, Glenda smacks her mouth with disdain.

"What the hell was that? That treacherous profiteer! How enraging that he dared to look down on us!"

Glenda goes on a tantrum.

Granbell glances coldly in the direction of the door and calmly comforts Glenda.

"Eh, don't say that, Glenda. Those people may behave like that, but they are actually sparing their highest degree of courtesy to us."

"But, Granbell-sama..."

"Glenda, you have no idea what their true identity is. Surely Hinata has noticed as well: these are the grim reapers among the arm-dealing black marketeers. She didn't feel the need to look into because they still had some use to her before, but as soon as she learned their true identity, there was no way she would have let them walk free."

"What do you mean by "their true identity" ?"

"Well of course, they are from the secret organization "Cerberus". And this Damrada is one of its leaders---Damrada the Gold."

The other elders nod in agreement.

In order to deal with them, all five elders have gathered. That in itself is an indication of the type of people they are confronting.

Now Glenda finally realizes.

"Oh, I've heard of them too. I've heard about the big underworld organization "Cerberus" that controls "The East". It's indeed truly troublesome dealing with those people. I'd love to see just how effective their methods are in the near future."

Glenda continues with quite the wild smile.

Granbell agrees with her view.

An evil smile emerges on his face as he lets the young girl sit on her lap as he caresses her blonde hair.

"Hehehe, things may not go so smoothly. After all, the demon that they are dealing with is no mere Greater Demon General."

He laughs delightfully.

According to investigations, that Demon was so overpowered as to look down on majin Razen. It would be a good chance to test out the power of Damrada's men, but the situation will also need a reassessment if they are defeated.

"If anything goes south, you still have me."

"Hmm. It shouldn't be a problem if you move out. Just in case, you'd better bring the other two of the "Three Martial Sages" along."

"I suppose. I'll do just as Granbell-sama suggests."

"It would also be beneficial to weaken Demon Lord Rimuru's forces. If we can't take out a demon as dangerous as this, it would remain a great concern."

"Even if we don't manage to kill him, it would still fortify the chances of victory for the allied army."

The Five Elders are on the same page as Granbell.

Glenda also agrees.

"However, that demon won't be able to do anything big. If he is to display his power in front of everyone, he will get a poor reputation amongst the other nations. The more dangerous he seems the more people will be calling for his demise. Glenda, do you understand your duty? You will use "Cerberus" to shut down that demon's movement."

Hypothetically, it would be all right if Damrada's party eliminates the demon.

But it won't matter if they fail. As soon as the allied army surrounds it, the demon won't be able to do a thing.

With the strength of "Three Martial Sages" Glenda and ex- "Three Martial Sages" Lama, the two alone should be able to take care of the demon with ease. However, it would be their victory even if they only stop the demon's movements.

Hero Youm's party won't be able to stand against the Farmus united army led by the new king.

Just to be extra cautious, they will have the other two "Three Martial Sages" Sare and Grigori to accompany and lead the conquest against the demon.

Now they've deployed an indestructible array.

"Understood, leave it to me. I, Glenda Adley shall take the job."

Glenda cracks up a smile.

Glenda Adley---A woman who owns a surname despite not being a noble.

In other words---

In the Kingdom of Siltrosso---Glenda Adley was a secret otherworlder summoned by the Rosso family.

In her original world, she was a mercenary that received military training from a foreign legion of a certain nation. After traveling around the world, her combat skill has become phenomenal.

She possesses the Unique Skill 'Sniper' and is able to skillfully utilize all types of firearms. She is also good at close-quarters combat, has superb assassination techniques and is skilled with hidden blades like a tantou (short sword)^[Referring to the traditional Japanese short sword Tantō].

Her beautiful leopard of a soul is bound to loyalty for Granbell upon her summoning.

Glenda ponders.

Hinata has only fought in this world for ten years. She is like a baby compared to Glenda, who, since childhood, has been growing in the dangerous warzones of another world.

A sixteen something young girl was able to reach the top by acquiring power through their summoning. This world is a heaven for someone such as Glenda who has gone through real hell---It is only natural for her to think this way^[The passage here is not very clear, here's what I think it means: Glenda loves the fact that whoever gets summoned to this world gets to acquire special skills that can help them to gain status, which was impossible from her past life of war and struggle. That's why she thinks now she has a chance to make it to the top.].

But in order for such idea to be true---everyone needs to be equal in this world.

Yet this is simply not the reality and that's why people pray to God.

The doctrines of Luminas sect is none the wiser. Yet even Glenda, a member of "Three Martial Sages" couldn't help but overlook it...

"Then, in order to put Sare and Grigori into motion, you should send out "Blood Shadow" first to do some preparations. You will have to coordinate with them as well."

"Blood Shadow" is the shadow force of Rosso family.

They are a group of mad warriors who can do any mission due to their exemplary combat abilities of their members. They all work under Glenda, and among them are many summoned otherworlders. This military organization is bound by a contract (spell) to serve the Rosso family.

Hearing this, Glenda nods.

"Then I shall do that if you wish them to move out. Everything for the Rosso. And for me to regain freedom."

"Hmm, very well. Proceed."

With Granbell's order, Glenda leaves the room with fighting will burning in her eyes.

The fire in the fireplace burns with crimson red.

With a sound of "pya-ji", the firewood explodes and allows the flames to burn even brighter.

"Is this all right, Mariabell?"

"Excellent, it's amazing, grandpa! Both parties would be stuck under such circumstances. Demon Lord Rimuru will be busy fighting against the Saint Hinata. During which, the Western Nations can interfere to settle the civil war within Farmus---all in the name of the new King Edward. That way, Edward won't be able to raise his head in front of grandpa again."

"That's right, Mariabell. We won't allow anyone to intrude on the domain of the Rosso!"

If that Demon Lord didn't secretly intervene in the civil war in Farmus , they could have provided help to both sides to further worsen the war for their own gain. But if they did that, it may have made the Kingdom of Ingracia too strong to be controlled.

The Rosso doesn't want any country to become more powerful than it should be.

That's why, in order to reach the ideal state of balance, Granbell Rosso secretly controls the scene.

"The world belongs to the Rosso!"

" " "The world belongs to the Rosso!" " "

The cute blonde girl Mariabell declares, followed by the others.

This is the center of the world.

Because the Rosso Family plans to dominate it.

This ambition, masked with the facade of the Western States Council, continues to grow...
