# Chapter 5: Saints and|Monsters Collide

And so, the battle begins in a flash.

The Holy Knight Order commenced into action behind Hinata, their commander being the adjutant of Hinata, Renard.

Renard did not start as a Holy Knight. Instead, he was a genius in the art of arcane magic---A Holy Magister.

The Holy Magister is a special job assigned only to individuals who have mastered "Spirit Magic", "Elemental Magic" and "Holy Magic". To master the laws of this world, that is what qualifies a Holy Magister.

Yet Renard became a swordsman who fought in battlefields wielding the holy sword. He has concealed his identity as a Holy Magister while at the same time, his reputation as a member of the Holy Knight Order grew day by day. Later, after some time, he had already become the vice-commander of the Holy Knight Order.

All these accomplishments were the result of his skills. He has mastered a magnificent set of sword skills. If you were to describe Arnaud's skill as the sword of steel, then Renard would be representing the swiftness^[The "柔" of swordsmanship, meaning the soft side or swift side of how a swordsman fight.] of swordsmanship. The two are on par with each other in terms of strength with Arnaud slightly excelling with the sword. It is Arnaud's hard-earned skill from his countless struggles on the battlefield.

When confronting strong and enduring monsters, a swordsmanship of tenacity and strength is more important than one that is fancy. That's why Arnaud is worthy of the title of the strongest Holy Knight.

However, a swordceror^[Swordceror, or Magic Swordsman is a job commonly seen in JRPG and fiction.] who possesses both the skills of a mage and a swordsman---that is the way Renard fights. His swordsmanship may be inferior to Arnaud, yet he will not lose to anyone when fighting in the style of a proper swordceror. No, not only not falling behind to anyone, Renard would even claim that his power is far greater than anyone else's.

However, to the Holy Knights, the power of "Elemental Magic" is not within the assessment of their strength. Some Holy Knights can instill elemental magic with the elven spirit of the same element that reside inside them so they may cast powerful magic without time consumed in chanting the spells.

"Elemental Magic" requires chanting, so its casting speed is longer than "Spirit Magic". Although its power may be greater than "Spirit Magic", "Speed" is the essence of melee combat.

It is something even Renard would not be able to overcome, and so he needed to master his sword techniques.

A knight's true strength stems from his mastery of sword art. By instilling the sword traveling and incredible speed^[The source states "Sword with the speed of god".] with holy-element, you can generate the power to slash through any object in this world. That is what Renard believes.

A very vivid memory was left with him when Renard was still an apprentice.

The small nation he studied abroad at was trampled by Demon Lord Valentine. Someone rushed to that nation---Hinata who just became a Holy Knight at the time.

She was strong, truly strong.

When surrounded by a horde of monsters, it only took a swing of her thin sword to wipe them all out. Even monsters that were several times larger than an average human were decimated in one shot by her sword.

Hinata's visit saved the locals who had fallen to despair.

From that day onward, Renard was attracted by the charm of swordsmanship.

While researching Spirit Magic on one hand, he could not forget the sights of Hinata's sword, and so he practiced repeatedly using a wooden sword while imitating her. He soon mastered the art of arcane magic^[This is likely referring to the combined of "Elemental Magic" and "Spirit Magic" (There are only four main categories of magic in the world of slime)] and returned to his academy in the Kingdom of Ingracia. There he studied Elemental Magic and waited patiently for the chance of moving to the Holy Empire of Lubelius.

It was not easy for foreigners to immigrate to Holy Empire of Lubelius, but if it was a believer of Luminas with outstanding achievement, he may be granted permission. However, it would come at the price of severing ties with his family. Renard chose to migrate without any hesitation. His mastery of both Elemental and Spirit Magic got him the permission to immigrate.

Later he studied Holy Magic in Lubelius and was able to earn a place as an apprentice Knight in the Order.

There Renard formed a pact with the spirit of "Light".

He was the Holy Knight of light, just as reflected from his pure and noble soul. It didn't take Renard too long after becoming a Holy Knight to become an adjutant of the person he looks up to---Hinata.

This is the result of his active initiatives in partaking challenging tasks and achieving impressive feats from them.

Many contenders of his have considered Hinata as a target (a role model to reach). These for instance included his colleagues Arnaud and Fritz, or more famously, the cruel and wise Nicolaus Speltus who was on par with Hinata.

And that is leaving out the countless unbeknownst followers of hers.

Renard was very proud to have become the adjutant of Hinata, until however...

"Renard, there is something that you must know."

After the occurrence of the heinous crime that was the murder of Archbishop Reyhiem, the great "Seven Luminary Clerics" summoned Renard. There, he learnt about the horrifying truth.

"The thing is, Hinata has been colluding with Demon Lord Valentine---"

"When we eliminated Valentine, he begged us for his life and revealed this information."

Renard's head went blank upon hearing this news.

His idol Hinata has been colluding with Demon Lord Valentine. In other words, she had been orchestrating a lie to deceive Renard this whole time.

If that is true, it would be a betrayal to someone as upright as Renard, it cannot be forgiven.

He believes there is no way these great heroes (Seven Luminaries) would ever lie. But even if that's the case, he doesn't think that Hinata has been deceiving the knights either.

*But if I recall... There haven't been any changes to Demon Lord Valentine's activities for some time. Hinata-sama should have successfully eliminated Demon Lord Valentine, yet she hasn't shown any sign to take any actions---*

Given the strength of Hinata, she must be able to take on Demon Lord Valentine on her own---That must be the case, Renard deeply believed so. He got the same impression from the combat report of the "Three Martial Sages" that Hinata would most definitely win if she moves out to take on Demon Lord Valentine.

Did she have something else on her mind...

Renard felt confused.

Yet it was then that Renard's doubt was reinforced when the Seven Luminaries continued:

"Of course, she must have lied to prevent Valentine from dying. But, that's not where things end."

"Although quite astonishing, she appears to be attempting to collude with Demon Lord Rimuru this time."

"Shouldn't it normally be impossible for Archbishop Reyhiem to be murdered on this holy land?"

As they bombarded Renard with information, he was completely baffled.

"B-but Hinata-sama is a follower of Luminas, more faithful than anyone else. How could she betray her god and us..."

As he responds, the Seven Luminaries continued to add on their arguments.

"That's the point, Renard. We are confused at the situation as well."

"But the reality may be the contrary. Since Hinata may have cleverly tricked both us and our God Luminas."

"There is however, one way to find out about it..."

The words of Seven Luminaries were tempting, and so Renard completely fell for it.

"A-and the way you mean is?"

The Seven Luminaries paused for a moment.

Then they open up solemnly:

"You won't have a chance to regret after hearing it."

"This is information that cannot be disclosed to the public---"

"Until Hinata is proved to be innocent."

Even being told so, Renard made his choice without hesitation.

He has completely been deceived by the wordplay of Seven Luminaries.

Renard was lured to give the answer that the Seven Luminaries wished to hear.

"That is not a problem at all. I will prove the innocence of Hinata-sama!"

"Hmm, that's the way to go..."

"Are you willing to lend a hand, Renard?"

"But this task will be dangerous."

Renard had made up his mind and waited patiently for the instructions of the Seven Luminaries.

The Seven Luminaries looked down on Renard satisfyingly and proclaimed:

"Eliminate that Demon Lord Rimuru!"

"That way, you will get your answer."

"If Hinata was truly colluding with the Demon Lord, she will definitely try to obstruct you with all her might."

Upon hearing this, Renard couldn't help but feel rattled.

"B-but There's also that evil dragon Veldora..."

The Seven Luminaries had expected Renard to have this reaction.

"Afraid not."

"Please calm down and consider this."

"Has the evil dragon truly been revived? Don't you think all of those testimonies have been lies?"

Renard suddenly realized after it was pointed out to him.

The only people who verified the issue of the revival of evil dragon are the Pope and Hinata herself.

"Then, do you propose that Veldora has not been revived?"

"Very likely."

"Reyhiem also didn't seem to have seen Veldora."

"Perhaps his excellency the Pope was just abetted by Hinata."

After hearing such assertions, Renard begins to doubt his beliefs, as proposed by the Seven Luminaries.

"I heard that Hinata has met with Demon Lord Rimuru before."

"We believe that she was indoctrinated then."

"If she is really being controlled by Demon Lord Rimuru..."

After hearing this, Renard's stance also begins to tilt.

*I am the only one who can save Hinata*---Naturally Renard began to think that way.

"You are right, that must be the case! There is no way that Hinata-sama will betray us. If we think in the direction of someone manipulating Hinata-sama, would it able to clear your suspicions of Hinata-sama?"

The Seven Luminaries nodded heavily after hearing Renard's words.

"Indeed. If we can find out the person behind this, her suspicions would be cleared---"

"But it will be a dangerous mission!"

The Seven Luminaries said so seemingly to test Renard's resolve, and Renard responded without any hesitation:

"Then please leave this mission for me to handle!"

Renard volunteered himself.

With the sole determination to rescue Hinata.

If everyone is truly being deceived by Hinata... Renard would kill Hinata with his own hands. And so, he made his resolve.

"Very well, it will be handed to you."

"We indeed feel your determination."

"We will be relying on you, Renard."

And so, Renard defied Hinata's order to commence in battle.

![soft scene break]

Renard isn't doubting any more as soon as he entered the Jura Great Forest.

He can tell that Veldora's revival is a lie given how low the concentration of magicule is there. Considering this, the possibility of Hinata having betrayed Luminism is very high, to which Renard is having a hard time to accept. He journeys on to his destination as he ponders on the issue.

Soon the troops would spread out since they are considering setting up a wide-range of "Holy Purification Barrier", yet his subordinates were ambushed by the enemies hiding around the area.

"Could it be that Hinata-sama has sold us out..."

Renard's companion, Garde of "Fire" opens up to say this.

Could it be that somehow, she has obtained the information of the movement of Renard's party and informed Demon Lord Rimuru of it?

---If Hinata was colluding with the Demon Lord, she will definitely try to obstruct you with all she has---

The words of "Seven Celestial" began to ring in Renard's head. But there is no time for him to consider it now. He immediately orders his men to engage in battle. The situation quickly turns into a chaotic battle.

The enemies are surprisingly strong. Moreover, things did not end there.

*Things are not going well in this way*, Renard was thinking so---when a nightmarish devil descends from the sky.

A giant crater is carved onto the ground with smoke engulfing its surroundings.

"This one's not that simple."

Garde nervously tightens the grip on his spear.

Renard nods in agreement and gives off the instructions calmly.

There are four other knights at the scene apart from Renard and Garde, while the rest are all busy fighting the engaging monsters.

The squad reacted quickly.

Light begins to surround them to form an armor to protect their body.

"Spirit Armament" ---It is the ultimate defensive gear that gives a Holy Knight the enhancement to overcome their limits.

Not only will it reduce the weight you feel, it would make you feel as if your body is as thin as a feather. With modifications, this holy armor allows the residing spirits of knights to be better reflected. With the armor equipped, the Holy Knights would gain more control over the power of their spirit.

Moreover, the weapons they wield are infused with the power to break evil forces that would paralyze all forms of resistance to deliver proper damage to an opponent.

Its weakness lies in the fact that its large consumption of mana makes it hard to sustain for long. But now, thanks to this armor, these Holy Knights have become the fiercest opponents for these monsters. The four spreads out with the targeted individual being in the center.

They are applying a simplified version of the Holy Purification Barrier as ordered.

Their opponent has an incredibly powerful presence. This majin in front of Renard possesses an unprecedented amount of magicules. It is even higher than a Rank A monster.

It isn't Demon Lord Rimuru, but it must be his top lieutenant.

This would be the skirmish battle before taking on Demon Lord Rimuru.

They must quickly defeat this majin in order to eliminate the primary target---Renard has made up his mind to not hold back at all and to fight with everything he has from the very start.

"Take aim of the target and activate the Holy Purification Barrier!"

They will lose their lives if they demonstrate even the slightest bit of carelessness.

He doesn't think that it is necessary to test out their opponent's strength and directly issued the order.

The Holy Knights spread around quickly to establish the Holy Barrier.

It was casted perfectly.

There is no way that this enemy would be able to break through the barrier from within. However, this is still not enough. After all, a simplified version of the barrier also only has a simplified endurance.

It has less range and weaker effects on weakening the monster. It may be able to block the enemy's movement, yet whether it can block every attack from within is still a mystery. They are afraid that the enemy would cast a powerful magic using its remaining magicule from inside the pyramid-shaped barrier extending around five meters long that they've activated. If that is the case, the barrier is likely going to be shattered.

Moreover, such an attack may also affect the surrounding. Since normally a barrier would cover a much larger area, this is a situation that should be accounted for with caution. However, it is definitely capable of severing the passage of magicules. It is one of the trump cards of the Holy Knights that an average Greater majin would have no chance of breaking.

Renard couldn't dare to get careless as he orders everyone to activate another defensive barrier. If the purification barrier is unable to kill their foe, they will have come up with a viable defensive plan during their available time.

They still can attack the interior from outside the barrier, but first they will need to confirm their safety before doing so. If it is a rare monster that possesses an attribute of damage-reflection, attacking without caution would only cause larger casualties among themselves. It is a misstep he cannot afford to take.

As Renard's party prepares at hand, the dust caused by the explosion also begin to settle.

A monster appears at the center.

It is a purple-haired tall female with slim and fit body.

Her long, tied hair runs behind her back.

She has a beautiful face with a mighty stern. But she has an additional black horn on her forehead.

The strange and exotic clothing (suit) compels one to take a few more glances before coming to any conclusion.

The woman speaks up as her purple eyes gaze at Renard.

"My name is Shion. I am Rimuru-sama's No.1 secretary. Now listen up you humans, Rimuru-sama has spoken. You either "Surrender" or "Die", pick an option. You gentlemen should be smart enough to understand what that means. So do quickly, disarm yourself and surrender to us!"

How arrogant this monster called Shion is as she proclaimed.

It is unknown why she emphasized very proudly on the word "No.1" as she gave her speech casually.

Renard begins to observe his opponent in order to find out how strong this monster called Shion really is. She is clearly different from an average monster.

Her large pool of magicule leads Renard to categorize her at the higher end of Rank A, but it does not end there.

"Impressive. She is at Special Rank A, possibly even a candidate for Demon Lord."

Judging from the horn on her forehead, the enemy is an advanced species of the Kijin race.

*Kijin, or even stronger*---Renard concludes that Shion's is a "Youki" (Fair Oni), a being that is comparable in power to a "Demon Lord Seed".

A named "Youki" ---That is definitely beyond Calamity rank. If she becomes a Demon Lord, her threat level would increase to Disaster rank.

There has been an extraordinarily powerful individual that possessed the psychic power (Or Godly Power)^[The source states "神通力", which is apparently is another term for "靈能力", the word for psychic power used in most fictions. But later in this word] to alter heaven and earth. Rather than monster, those are more akin to the Earth Deity.

It seems that Renard has made the right choice to have remained on the highest alert with the rest.

"Huh! Unfortunately, you've guessed it wrong. Well, close enough. I am an *Akki*^[Fuse gave the same katakana notation for both "Youki" (妖鬼) and "Akki" (悪鬼) are "oni", which is why this was translated wrongly to oni originally.]. And I'm just guessing, but I'm probably not as kind as you think I am!"

Shion rebukes Renard calmly.

That said, surely no one at the scene would have ever considered calling Shion "kind". Regardless of where she got the idea, it was the warning that Shion gave them.

"An *Akki*? There isn't much difference... Anyway, whatever you are is irrelevant to us. Even if you were an Earth deity, you are nothing more than an evil monster, as far as we're concerned. We only believe in the one true God, Luminas."

The Holy Empire of Lubelius only recognizes the existence of one god---"The One True God" Luminas. To them, this is an absolute truth.

They wouldn't acknowledge her even if she is indeed an Earth Deity guarding some part of the land.

They may ignore it as long as it doesn't start proclaiming itself to be a God, but if it did, it will be eliminated.

Moreover, their opponent right now is just a monster.

No matter how powerful she is, they will not spare any mercy for the minions of a Demon Lord. That is why Renard proclaimed his own beliefs.

Yet Shion responded with the utterly unacceptable to Renard.

"I'm not interested in your God. Just give an answer to my question already!"

Surrender or die, which path do you choose? That's what Shion is asking.

Her words infuriated Renard.

"Silence, evil monster! I will erase your filthy existence from this world!"

Renard now furiously shouts with his lungs full, then he orders the Holy Knights to cast the Holy Magic "Holy Cannon" at the same time.

The "Holy Cannon" is one of the few offensive spells in the art of Holy Magic. It breaks down the body of a monster through disintegrating its magicule. If it is casted at humans, it at most would knock them down unconscious due to the shockwave, yet in the case of monsters, they would be completely decimated.

It is a useless skill against opponent with the holy-element, but a deadly deterrence against monsters. Unlike the four natural elements of "Earth", "Water", "Fire" and "Wind", both "Holy" and "Dark" elements cannot be "Nullified". Except the angel race and the monsters who possess the holy-element, any other monster would not stand a chance against the Holy Cannon.

As they received Renard's order, the Holy Knights launched the attack simultaneously. The missiles from the Holy Cannon thrust from all four sides towards Shion.

However---

Confronted with such attacks, Shion stood still without a care. She then deflected all of the energy missiles with the odachi in her hand.

"Was that your answer? You understand that if you don't surrender, I will kill you right?"

As if grumbling "why won't you guys just do as I say?", Shion presses her question to him again. Even Renard is astounded at this.

However, he is not going to succumb to such a threat.

Even if his enemy is monster at the level of an Earth Deity, she was already trapped by the Holy Purification Barrier.

Renard's party waited for the enemy to weaken by maintaining the barrier in order to deliver her with a fatal blow.

He ponders while praising the skillful swordsmanship Shion demonstrated. Reasonably speaking, his opponent would have been weakened to some extent, yet the speed of her swing can rival even that of Renard's. This surprises him a lot. Moreover, that odachi was capable of deflecting energy of the holy-element, which is beyond abnormal. Since the Holy Cannon has the character of disintegrating magicules, normal magic swords would be destroyed after deflecting a few rounds.

Yet there is no sign of that odachi being damaged.

Suddenly, one of the Holy Knight began to moan in pain.

It is the Holy Knight on one side of the pyramid-shaped barrier who has been hit by the Holy Cannon deflected by Shion.

*How is this possible! Why is such thing possible!*

Renard is astounded.

If blocking the holy-element alone is not enough, she even absorbed the energy with her odachi and quickly deflected the missile to turn it into a way to attack...

It is completely impossible by common sense.

Yet such psychic power was displayed by Shion so easily in the blink of an eye. Renard quickly orders everyone to stop attacking.

The injured knight did not lose consciousness, he's at most surprised at the sudden attack. Now it's the time to calm down and find out a different way of attacking. Yet still, this has really been astounding.

The fact that she was able to attack from the inside of the Holy Purification Barrier to the outside is beyond surprising. Even the Holy Knights are astounded at the sight.

Renard suppresses his emotion of shock to reconsider his strategy.

Right now, Shion is furious due to her act being less effective as she intended.

She didn't cause much damage despite hitting the opponent. She discovered that the skill they used was effective against monsters, but ineffective against humans. She has paid the price for looking down on her opponents to have been locked in the barrier, a critical miscalculation.

However, she knew from the start that things will end up this way. She has considered beforehand that the situation she is currently in is what she had hoped for. This barrier---It's an extension of the Holy Purification Barrier Rimuru warned her of. It is similar in nature to reduce the magicule concentration from within the barrier. At this rate, it wouldn't take long before Shion's skill will be affected.

Just now she secretly tried to find out that "Spatial Movement" has also been blocked. With that being said, this is also within her range of expectations.

"Oi... OI, you guys, just surrender already before I run out of patience."

Shion suppresses her anger desperately and shouts at her opponents with a forced smile.

Although a third party may think Shion isn't even batting an eyelid at the Holy Knights, in reality she couldn't be more serious. (it's Shion after all)

But it is obvious that Renard and the Holy Knights wouldn't listen to her.

"You fool! You are helpless now that you've been trapped by the barrier, stop acting all smug over there!"

This time, it's Garde who shouted out furiously.

It only angers Shion more.

Now that her fury is reaching her limit, she is at the brink of an outburst. Shion already has very low tolerance for things, and now she is at the limit of her endurance.

There will be a huge outburst sooner or later.

"Listen now, I really am under Rimuru-sama's orders that if possible, I shouldn't try to kill you all. If you surrender now, not only will I not beat all your teeth out, but I'll even treat you to my handmade cooking! How about that, isn't it a great proposal? This is my last warning to you. What will you do?"

Even under such circumstance, Shion endures and continues to negotiate.

Although she comes off as being so arrogant, that no one would ever accept such a request.

Moreover, with every second passing, the monster captured inside the Holy Purification Barrier will grow weaker.

The reason behind it is simple, the barrier would purify all magicule inside it.

With the magicule concentration reduced, it would mean that any magic casted using mana or monster power, as well as law-manipulating skills such as psychic power and magic manipulation would all become unavailable. That is with the exception of special (unique/ultimate) skills.

The Holy Knights believed that they would emerge victorious and so there is no need to listen to Shion. Yet they have to recognize one point, that the Holy Purification Barrier is no defensive barrier. Even though it may completely block passage of magicule, pure physical objects or energy can still pass through. For instance, if an explosion takes place inside the "Barrier", the wind pressure and shreds of explosion would be carried on the outside.

Renard and the rest are all well aware of this, and so their nerves are still tightened. Their maximum alert is of course warranted too. But being on high alert is still not enough to wipe away the unease in his heart, yet still Renard decides to answer Shion.

"We Holy Knights do not negotiate with monsters. Whatever more you say is futile."

He says so.

Shion couldn't bear it any longer after hearing this.

"Very well, I understand! Then I will make you submit out of fear!"

As Shion shouts, she smashes her odachi on the ground.

The shockwave explodes the ground to send countless fragments of small stones flying in the air. Shion grabs onto one of them and throws it head-on towards the knight facing her.

"---Uh!"

In an instant.

A loud sound is produced as a mini explosion occurs in front of the Holy Knight that Shion faces. The piece of stone thrown at him collided with the shield over the knight's hand and got shredded to pieces.

*What incredible POWER! ゴゴゴゴゴゴ*

She possesses such power even after being weakened. She must be capable of causing much more damage had the Holy Purification Barrier not been there.

"Don't get careless! Infuse more power into your spirit armor!"

"Understood, everyone, it's time to get serious! Consider your opponent a Demon Lord!"

Renard and Garde encourage their squamates.

The knight who had his shield smashed, quickly reconstructs the shield of light.

Shion stomps her feet in frustration seeing how Renard's party reacted. She probably thought that her attack just now would be able to take down at least one opponent. Yet she's furious now that she's suffered the waterloo. Her behavior is in complete contrast to her appearance of a beautiful and intelligent woman. With that being said, Shion seems to have realized this is going nowhere. She again suppresses her anger trying her best to remain calm and opens up to Renard again.

"I have a proposal."

"We don't negotiate with monsters. I've already told you so."

"You should try to listen first. Just as I mentioned, it was my order to not kill you. But with that being said, I also need to demonstrate to you just how much of a difference there is between our strengths."

"..."

"Just hear me out. I mentioned earlier that I had to control my power when throwing those stones, it is not easy. Had I been more serious I would probably have killed one or two of you---"

"Y-you're bluffing!"

"Don't listen to her! This is her deluded brag!"

A couple of Holy Knight couldn't help but respond to Shion's words.

Shion chuckles in secret after seeing how they reacted.

"Hmm hmm. You guys seem to be willing to listen. That is great. So, my proposal is---"

"Don't be fooled by her! The madness of this woman cannot be---"

Shion's words are interrupted by Garde.

At that instant, he suddenly feels a burning sensation on his right ear. Garde still feels the delayed shockwave slashing through the air with bombarding sound, destroying his eardrum.

The reason why he didn't get a concussion is probably due to his daily training...

"W-what happened?"

As Renard turns back to check on Garde, he witnesses the sights of the large tree behind him falling apart due to its root being cut in half.

"---Uh!"

Renard is speechless.

Garde, as blood pours out of his ear, also realizes what just happened.

It was the stone that Shion threw out.

That was just how she demonstrated her strength.

The fist-sized stone Shion threw flitted at supersonic speed next to Garde's head and directly hit the large tree behind his head, smashing it into pieces in the process.

Of course, Shion didn't miss her shot.

She aimed and threw precisely to make sure it passes just by Garde's ear.

And so, she follows up with the line---

"What's the use of ears if you won't even listen to what others have to say? Now behave yourself and listen to me well."

The other knights immediately became more obedient.

"You *monster*..."

Garde mumbles as well, though he does not dare to make a move without caution.

So is Renard, realizing that he will have to listen to what Shion has to say. Judging from the power of that throw, it will instantly kill one of his teammates if collided head-on. Even "Spirit Armament" would not be able to resist the shockwave of that impact.

Since it has been proven that Shion has such power when she's serious, they can only deduce that her words just now were anything but lies. It was a projectile thrown so fast that even one of the "Ten Great Saints", Garde of "Fire" couldn't react to, any ordinary Holy Knight would not be able to evade it.

In other words, the right answer here is to listen to her words nicely.

But as long as they can buy time, their opponent would also be weakened during the process.

"Fine, we'll hear you out for the sake of it."

This is why Renard can only reply with this.

Hearing so, Shion nods satisfyingly.

A maniacal smile emerges on her face as she gives them the shocker.

"Listen now, I want you all to attack me with everything you have. I'll take everything head-on. If I endure till the end, I win, and you will all surrender to me obediently. What do you say?"

Shion says so confidently, leaving Renard eyeing her baffled. In that moment, a small doubt raises in his heart.

*Could this mean that she doesn't intend to kill us?*

Shion has acted and spoken in such way as to lead to this conclusion from the very start.

But, her reason for doing so...

Unfortunately, there is no time for Renard to figure it out the details.

Garde whose eardrum was just destroyed accepted Shion's offer out of spite.

"Fine, I'll accept your proposal. You there, align your spirit powers with mine. Renard, I'll leave the suppressing work to you! This woman is dangerous, way too dangerous to be allowed to live!"

Renard is brought back to reality after being mentioned.

"W-wait! We should talk about---"

"Cut the crap! Everyone, get in formation!"

At the urges of Garde, the teammates start to concentrate their power.

The Holy power begins to flow and gather on top of the Holy Purification Barrier. This is all being converted to mana that gives Garde a boost in magic. If Renard allowed them to do so without suppressing, the four squad mates' mana pool would go out of control.

*Indeed, now it's time for battle, not hesitation. Since this is what she volunteered to, then don't blame us if we do so.*

Their opponent asked them to attack with everything they have, and so Garde would gamble on his pride as a Holy Knight to spare no mercy.

Six to one is way too despicable---He bears no such naive thoughts. Since his enemy is monster, their victory would be justice.

"Understood, Garde. Leave the suppression to me."

"Roger that! Take this, "Inferno Flame" ^[Or by Kanji "Spirit overlord of extreme inferno flame"]---!"

Garde wields an extreme power of flame that illustrates his fire like passionate personality.

It is the ultimate spirit magic that can be casted when the King of Fire Spirit lends its power to the caster. It is an immense amount of power that Garde alone cannot control, and this power is being bombarded on Shion.

The heat energy produced by it even exceeds that of the Nuclear Strike Magic "Heat Cannon".

It is a pure flow of destructive power using the spirit energy particles that magicule is made up of.

Yet Shion---

"Hehehe, very impactful! It is not the attack I expected, but it doesn't matter. This will be the fastest way to stir fear among you all!"

Shion raises her odachi with a delightful smile.

In the blink of an eye, the approaching heat wave of the "Inferno Flame" is slashed in half.

It is Shion's Unique Skill 'Cook' at work.

It may seem that she isn't thinking a lot, but in reality, she has been combining a variety of skills.

First, she applies Extra Skill 'Multilayer Barrier s' for defense and utilizes "Heavenly Gaze" and "Magic Perception" to detect her enemies' weakness.

She then activates "Cook" and "Optimal Action" so she can sense the flow of the heat wave naturally. By doing so, she can avoid being directly hit by the attack.

With that being said, the heat wave still scorched Shion's skin, making her appear horribly burned. However, it poses no problem to Shion who has Ultraspeed Regeneration. Her skin quickly regenerates to its previous state.

It would appear to be reckless, but in fact, all of these are reasonable actions.

"All right, we've had our promise. Surrender to me now and undo the barrier."

Shion says so very righteously, leaving everyone speechless. The Holy Knights can only peek at Renard and Garde.

After witnessing those supernatural sights, their minds have been paralyzed. At that moment, the dignity of the Holy Knights was decimated.

Yet there is only one man, Garde, who will not accept this.

"Quit joking around, you monster. You can't do anything within that barrier! You can keep acting smug like you are now, but we'll fight the long battle with you then!"

"W-wait a second, Garde!"

Renard is shocked.

Even though Garde may be bad at holding his temper, he is a straightforward man. Yet right now he is being stubborn and refusing to admit defeat.

It may seem to be the appropriate response from the eyes of the Holy Knights, but to Renard, this is not like Garde.

With that being said, it is no time to ponder over such thing.

"Huh, are you still not admitting defeat even to this point? I will have no choice but to kill you..."

Shion gives off an increasingly more dangerous outlook as her monster aura begins to flow around her body.

Renard shivers at the sight.

*H-how powerful...! We will all be killed if such monster gets serious. Even if we have Holy Purification Barrier, it would be bad if we piss her off---*

"This is bad, stop provoking her! We can retreat for now---"

"You fool! The Holy Knights cannot be defeated! Have you forgotten even about that!"

Renard intended to calm Garde down, yet he begins to shake as Garde shouted him back.

It is hard to imagine that Garde would ever say such thing under normal circumstance. Or rather, he almost seems to have developed a new personality---

"You, you---"

Renard didn't have to raise any decisive doubts towards Garde before *the incident* happens.

"HUUUUU!"

Someone shouts.

A clear bell-ring sound is made.

It is the sound of Shion's odachi breaking through the "Barrier".

The Holy Purification Barrier---The source of confidence of the Holy Knights have now been completely shattered by Shion.

"H-how could this be..."

"But that is the Holy Barrier!"

"Is this a dream? This must be a dream!"

"Holy Purification Barrier can sever magicule, so how could it be destroyed by monster---!!"

The Holy Knights shout with fear in their hearts.

However, they received their answers from Shion, who seems relaxed and justified with her actions.

"---That's true indeed. But this is not a "Special Barrier" with high density, a "Special Barrier" that manipulates the world's law. Law manipulation is, however, my specialty. After all, I, am very good at cooking!"

Renard is completely baffled with what she said.

But he understands what Shion has done. She has brought about this result by using her Unique Skill 'Cook' to tamper with the Holy Purification Barrier.

Overwriting phenomenon and laws. This skill is capable of overwriting objects with the ideal "Outcome" desired by the user---the so called "Affirmative Outcome".

This is the true power of Shion's Skill 'Cook'. The reason why Shion's cooking became tasty is all due to the effect of this skill. Sadly, such extraordinary power has been used in very pitiful things.

What would be the result of applying it in combat?

The answer is the desperate situation that Renard's party is facing right now.

The skill is able to overwrite and impose one hundred percent of the ideal outcome she wishes, and so no matter how strong a defense is, it won't stand a chance against her.

The only way to fight it would be to possess a stronger will to overwrite the result she wishes. In other words, unless you possess similar ability to overwrite laws, you have no way of dealing with it.

Since Renard is a genius, he was able to correctly analyze the mystery of her skill.

*How terrifying.*

As Shion just declared, Renard's heart is now filled with fear. But as captain, he cannot give up hope until the very last moment. They are doomed if they engage in combat, so he needs to surrender for now to have a chance in survival.

"This is bullshit...How could this be... Such monster, how..."

Ignoring Garde, who is mumbling and almost daydreaming, Renard makes the decision.

"---I surrender. I hope you may treat my subordinates with leniency..."

He proclaims with a shivering voice as if he has woken from a dream.

Shion finally gives off a satisfying smile hearing Renard's declaration of surrender.

It is then that Renard is able to look at Shion in the eyes.

He sees her genuine smile that's both consistent externally and internally.

He calmly recalls while pondering on her words.

This monster called Shion really doesn't seem to intend to kill them. If not Shion's will, then it is the order of Demon Lord Rimuru.

With that being said, something also seems out of the loop with the rumor that Demon Lord Rimuru has ordered a Demon to murder Archbishop Reyhiem.

Now that he thinks about it carefully, Hinata only went to meet with Demon Lord Rimuru in order to build a friendly relationship from the very start. In contrast, there shouldn't be any reason why the Demon Lord would want to obstruct that. That is if he doesn't intend to incite conflicts and rain chaos. But from the reaction of this monster, Shion, even Renard has realized that Demon Lord Rimuru wouldn't do such a thing.

That would mean---

*Have I been manipulated...*

When he heard that his enemy Demon Lord Valentine who harmed his friends in the past was colluding with Hinata, he lost the ability to make a calm judgement. While he was emotional, he was taken advantage of and was deceived...

By whom?

It is obvious now, the "Seven Luminary Clerics".

Upon thinking so, Renard's face immediately turns pale. He is shocked to realize that his dispatchment of troops have hindered Hinata's plan.

As he turns to look, Hinata is confronting Demon Lord Rimuru alone.

They don't seem to be talking. It is the calmness before battle.

*I-it's all over. Hinata-sama, I'm sorry! It's all my fault that the negotiation---*

Renard has finally realized everything, yet now he can only observe their confrontation from the side.

Things have developed to the point beyond Renard's control.

---And soon, the flame of battle is ignited.

Renard nervously locks his eyes in front as Hinata and Rimuru cross swords---

![hard scene break]

Hinata Sakaguchi was truly lucky to have met Shizue Izawa.

For a short but genuine period of time, Hinata had indeed opened her heart to Shizue and her alone.

The duration of which was one month.

In that short span of time, Hinata learnt all of Shizue's techniques and bid her farewell. That is because she was afraid of being rejected. In the end, she was afraid to lose the warmth she had regained once more.

Hinata knew she was clumsy.

She killed her father for her mother. Yet it only made her mother go insane. Her mother was still in love with her husband even to that point.

The reason why her mother was a fanatic about religion must have been because she needed prayers to support herself.

In this world, misfortune will never disappear.

It is the most natural course of things.

She hoped that there would be no more misfortune in this world, yet such thing would never come true.

That was the reality Hinata didn't want to accept.

A world where everyone can live with joy---she sighs at the misfortune in real life while bearing such dream.

---The reason why her mother prays is to repent for the sins of her daughter.

*If that is true, does mother hate me very much?*

Hinata was deeply frightened even at the thought of it being the case.

She thought of herself as very lucky for coming to this (new) world.

Her mother would be able to escape the sea of pain now that she had traveled to this world, so was her conclusion.

Hinata has also decided to not be as indignant as before.

She would become just as perfect (emotionless/rational) as a machine so that she no longer would have to worry about anything.

Hinata lived on with such a fantasy. And it was for this reason, she wasn't able to accept Shizue.

If she had accepted to stay and somehow grew to be disliked by Shizue too---Hinata would have wanted to kill her.

It is due to her self-awareness of this, that she parted ways with Shizue.

*Perhaps I was the one who's mad after all*---Hinata thought to herself.

This is what this world is about, full of despair and fragile people susceptible to death. Hinata was granted with power for her to survive.

She learnt a shocking lesson when she visited a kingdom during her journey.

There, many were dead due to the rampage of Calamity Rank monsters. Yet there were some people fighting to protect the children. Those adults acted as the meat shield for the children with no intention of escaping.

Hinata had always thought that everyone only care about themselves in order to survive. Their actions moved Hinata.

Those people who devoted themselves to battle called themselves Holy Knights. They had little care for their own lives and were willing to sacrifice themselves to save the lives of others. They regularly patrolled the surroundings of that town as the symbols of justice.

Hinata resonated with their way of living and was determined to become a Holy Knight. To use her skills to the fullest and devote herself to battle, so she will no longer need to worry about anything else. And so, Hinata found her opportunity to atone.

A decade of time has passed since---

Hinata has now become the Guardian Angel of mankind.

![soft scene break]

She fought against monsters day and night during those days.

After some time, she began to feel bored of dealing with the same situations again and again.

Ever since Hinata installed some policies after becoming the commander of the Holy Knight Order, the damage sustained by the nations had been reduced by a drastic amount. For instance, the prediction of the birthplace of the monsters or which areas would be harmed. This way, she was able to decide on how to initiate collaborative efforts and when to patrol in certain areas. This system had been optimized to achieve a significant effect in reducing casualties.

That was why everyone in the Holy Knights placed great trust in Hinata. It is simply too ironic that she was in fact colluding with Demon Lord Valentine behind everyone's back. She mocks herself internally. But even so, it was still the best way to maintain a peaceful and just nation.

That's why Hinata has never felt any doubt or regret. Under their God Luminas, everything is equal---This is the only system that will grant people the taste of happiness.

Moving forward to the present.

She is in a bad spot, to the point of being laughable. But thanks to that, Hinata is finally willing to go all out.

The situation at hand is not suitable for her to negotiate. She will not even have a chance to defend herself if she loses this battle.

It must have been karma for not listening to Rimuru the last time they faced each other, that she fails to request her opponent to listen to her this time for the bad circumstance.

*The situation is the complete opposite of last time---*

Hinata mocks herself while thinking so.

The table has been turned. It even makes her reminisce of the "boring" days she used to complain so much about.

*This world is indeed ruthless when you hit the wall...*

But apart from lamenting, Hinata has also made up her mind.

Troubling thoughts and worries are all meaningless at this point of time.

Victory is the only way of withdrawing herself from this situation. Regardless of whether she believes herself to be right or wrong.

All these thoughts were cast aside, for Hinata has focused her heart on winning---

She begins to observe Rimuru. Now only Rimuru and herself remain there as Arnaud and the rest have gone somewhere else with their own opponents.

Hinata starts to quietly analyze Rimuru using her Unique Skill 'Mathematician'.

However, he is completely different from before. Rimuru's power after becoming a Demon Lord has become hard to measure.

*His potential growth is truly huge. I'll get chills down my spine at even the thought of him becoming enemies with humans.*

Rimuru's power is immeasurable by Hinata's "Mathematician", meaning that he should either have a similar power cap as her, or greater. Upon thinking so, Hinata activates her Unique Skill 'Usurper'. This skill gives her the absolute advantage against an opponent who is stronger than her.

That is the property of Hinata's trump card--- "Usurper".

It is a power that can rob the enemy of their skills and talents whenever they are understood by the user. Regardless of whether Hinata can use these skills or not, from only its effect of robbing her enemies of their skills alone shows that it is itself a fierce and brutal skill.

If the opponent is weaker than Hinata, the result of the analysis will show it as "Unavailable Target". In that case, Hinata will not be able to rob the enemy of their skill, however, she will also have a much better chance to win. Even if the opponent is stronger than Hinata, the results of her analysis will either be "Failure" or "Success".

It is the evidence whenever such results are shown that whether she is confronting a powerful foe or not. With that being said, "Success" analysis will reveal the opponent's skills and talents and "Failure" will not cause her defeat either. She can try analyzing as many times as she wishes.

That's why no matter how strong her enemy is, the result will always be "Success" with enough repetitions. She only needs to cautiously buy time and calmly wait for the correct moment. In this way, Hinata is guaranteed to win.

During her last duel with Rimuru, the result of her analysis stated "Target Unavailable". This was why Hinata did not take any precaution against Rimuru and looked down on him during their fight.

She was a bit surprised when he summoned the Flame Giant Ifrit, but she still didn't take it very seriously. That's because Hinata has achieved expert mastery of her skill to reach the level of "Forced Usurp". It is a cheat-like skill that can even apply to lower-level opponent...

It was commendable that Rimuru made her use this skill, but that was as far as her view went for Rimuru. Just like that, Hinata's "Usurper" also serves as the measurement tool to evaluate the difference in power between her and her opponent.

Back to the present day.

Even with this power, she still cannot assess Rimuru.

The result of her analysis turned out to be "Interfered".

This is the second time it happened. He is the second person to cause this result after Hinata's confrontation with Demon Lord Luminas Valentine.

*In other words, you are already as powerful as Luminas-sama...*

Hinata gasps at how much he has grown during such a short period of time.

If that's the case, there is no use to try any cheap tricks.

Hinata throws away the giant sword in her hand---Dragon Buster. She knows that she can't win by relying on that.

Then she unsheathes the Moonlight Rapier (Moonlight) ---A legendary weapon of hers gifted by Luminas.

She puts on the "Gears of Holy Spirit" ---

These are the original pieces that the "Spirit Armament" worn by the Holy Knights was copied from. It is rumored to be once worn by a Chosen Hero, and a secret weapon of the Western Holy Church to battle against monsters. It is a gear specialized against monsters and dragons, only usable by those favored by the Holy Spirit.

A beam of bright light descends to surround Hinata and gradually forms the shape of a glowing armor. From that point onwards, Hinata has broken free of all forms of limits in her body to transcend "Sage" and truly reaching the realm of "Saint".

Next, it will be the pure collision of force.

She is willing to gamble everything she has to partake in this challenge.

Her ordinary daily life without anything refreshing---has now come to an end.

Fighting a battle with little chance to win is for the foolish. Yet Hinata's heart right now is filled with joy.

She gives off a chuckle.

*Rimuru asked me whether I received his message or not. It means that he is inviting me to a one-to-one duel.*

*I must win, and so, I will earn the chance to make up for my mistake---*

She is filled with determination and fighting spirit.

Hinata points her sword at Rimuru.

![hard scene break]

Hinata is pointing her sword at me.

Is she choosing to duel me even after receiving my message?

I seem to have misunderstood when she threw away her weapon that she would have wanted to talk. She has taken out a more intimidating weapon and her eyes are now absolutely serious.

It can't be helped. I'll defeat her first before trying to talk.

My new confrontation against Hinata has made me realize something.

This woman has no flaw in her stance.

The power of that sword is among the top of all of the weapons I've encountered so far. In order to stand a chance against it, I also pull out my uchigatana^[Traditional Japanese sword (打刀)] to prepare for battle.

Had I known about this, I would have had Kurobee craft me a special blade for this occasion. This sword I am currently wielding has been submerged in the magicules inside my "Stomach", and as a result its blade is now dyed with a fitting color of black.

Still it's now too late to get a new weapon, so rather than panicking, I put my faith in Kurobee's skills (to forge my sword).

Confronting Hinata's weapon with this substitute weapon makes me feel uneasy. I should protect my uchigatana with my Youki (Demonic Aura) and try to avoid direct clashes of swords with her. That's why I activated the "Magic Fighting Spirit" ^[The more accurate name of this skill is actually: Qi (aura) fighting with magic] from my "Covenant King Uriel" and covered the blade with "Black Thunder Flame".

Now that I am properly prepared, I wait for Hinata to make her move.

And so, the battle of hyper-speed swordfight begins.

I gave all I had as soon as it started.

Hinata's attack speed is incredible, to the point that I can barely react even with "Thought Acceleration", enhancing my senses to a million of times of my original. Another way to put this would be to say that it is reminiscent of fighting Milim, surely now you can tell how fast it is.

However, I am not losing either. I block and return every hit. Now we've crossed swords directly several times, yet none of us could land a hit on the other.

I'm not bragging but I haven't even got a scratch.

And that's what's happening, both of us are attacking and are waiting for the opponent to show an opening, yet such an opportunity is still yet to arrive for either of us. By the way, I'm able to go toe to toe with her only due to my awakening as a Demon Lord and with the help of "Wisdom King Raphael", and that alone simply reflects what a *monster* Hinata is.

But honestly, I believe I'm only a few inches away from taking her down.

Hinata is indeed strong, but I am now a "True Demon Lord", so I should be able to suppress her with my body function alone. Yet the result is that we are on par in strength.

Hinata seems to have completely seen through my sword technique, and so she begins to attack without hesitation. Her attacks are swift while still blocking every counterattack I deliver. On top of that, she has even sacrificed her fierce continuous attacks to instead deliver a surprise attack.

If it was me from the past, I would not have stood a chance. This simply means that Hinata didn't displayed her true ability at all during our last confrontation.

Should I consider myself lucky?

It seems that I have to give my fullest in this fight if I wish to defeat her.

![hard scene break]

*You've got to be kidding me*, Hinata thinks to herself.

She wanted to force Rimuru to admit defeat by bombarding him with her sword techniques. Yet Rimuru was able to catch up with her at ease. These are the techniques Hinata spent ten years to master, yet her opponent---completely countered them in an instant.

There is a limit to the human body. Only by using magic, abilities, skills, and talents^[Despite how similar these words may sound, they apparently are different attributes of an individual in Slime's world. Not necessarily the most strictly obeyed categorization though.] can humans obtain the strength to stand against monsters. In contrast however, Rimuru doesn't even need to breathe.

No stamina consumption means there is no need to restore mana, nor will his muscle tire out.

*Hehe, I only get to realize how cruel reality is when standing on the battlefield against him...*

Hinata thinks to herself, sighing at her disadvantage.

She knew very well of the fact that her opponent is a monster. Since this world follows the principle of "survival of the fittest", the important thing for her to do now is to gather all the factors that may ensure her victory.

Hinata utilized her "Mathematician" to enhance the speed of her senses a thousand times more than usual. Her perception of the surrounding area has also exceeded the human limit. Her brain is functioning at its maximum capacity, causing the micro vessels in her body to have burst a few times. She took care of the wounds by using an automatic regenerative spell to hide these injuries from her opponent's detection.

Under this state, Hinata feels as though the world has become stationary. Yet it is still not enough. Hinata activates "Prediction Simulation" of "Mathematician" to predict the path of Rimuru's attack. Hinata has to strike without holding anything back.

However, her opponent Rimuru still seems to be holding back.

Hinata wiped her bleeding nose so that her opponent didn't notice before adjusting her disordered breathing. Holding like this for too long alone would already mark Hinata's defeat.

Even though she has reached the level of "Saint", Hinata is still bounded by the limits of a human body. She has to overcome a higher wall in order to become a semi-spiritual-lifeform.

Her trusted "Usurper" is rendered useless due to the "Interference". It has absolute advantage over the strong---But now, it is no longer useful. Then, she will have to defeat Rimuru with only the skills she has trained during all those years...

The sword gifted by Luminas possesses immense power. If it is installed with Hinata's mana and enchanted with her fighting aura, it can cause lethal wounds that can't be treated by any average regenerative ability. Even against enemies possessing "Ultra-Speed Regeneration", this sword can cut them in half.

*That's why all I need to do is to cut off one of his arms.* Hinata thinks to herself.

She won't kill Rimuru. The duel will be over if Rimuru is willing to admit Hinata as the victor.

Yet Hinata has not been able to execute this plan.

Through his extraordinary control of dimension and body functions, Rimuru has seen through the pattern of Hinata's attack.

*What an incredible growth. But these all have to do with body functions. You can't follow up with my level of skill.*

His evolution is indeed astounding, yet in terms of techniques, he is just about the same as what she has experienced before. Even for a skill such as Hinata's "Usurper" that can rob the opponent's skills, it can only make the user's body memorize the movements of the skill. In order to master the principles of these skills, the amount of repetitive training required would be so much as to cause one to faint.

It seems to be the same case for Rimuru.

Hinata sees a chance to win. For there is a difference in their experience on the battlefield.

Rimuru is clearly lacking in that regard.

Hinata decides to change her tactics as she realizes this in order to give her opponent the false sense of her attacks being random in speed.

In other words, a feint.

She decides to toy Rimuru in the palm of her hands with the skill she accumulated through her rich experience---

![hard scene break]

The speed of Hinata's sword suddenly increases.

That flexible sword technique---even with the speed of my senses boosted to millions of times faster, I still have a feeling of uneasiness when Hinata suddenly changes the path of her sword.

"Are you kidding me!" I think to myself as I desperately try to catch up to her.

This is Hinata Sakaguchi.

Although I know this already, but her title of the Guardian of Mankind is truly not for show.

As we continue our intense battle, I am also observing Hinata.

There is a subtle grin on her face as she looks at me with the confidence to win. I can't catch Hinata's movement with my eyes alone.

Her eyes are fixated on me almost as if they are a sensor working to perceive every subtle movement of the surrounding. She must have been attacking based on such perception. While maintaining her natural stance, the center of gravity in her body is not shifting outside of her base, making her capable of reacting to every offense of her opponent. She isn't applying any force on her movement and is always in a relaxed state without the need to show any preparational act while she launches a variety of attacks.

I have no idea how Hinata is predicting my attacks, perhaps my pattern has been completely seen through by her.

Regardless, I can only desperately evade Hinata's attack by maneuvering around, purely relying on my body functions. It becomes quite clear that my movements are less agile due to that reason.

I will definitely face defeat if I continue to be tricked by her in this way.

My body functions are supposed to be stronger than hers, yet the strange thing is that my attack pattern has completely been seen through by her. Hinata's skills are way beyond me. But even if that was the case, the Hinata in front of me is not getting any careless for that reason.

In contrast to our last encounter, not only the feeling she gives off is very different, but everything about her seems to be different. Her sword skills were enchanted with her fighting aura, so being hit by it would likely result in critical injury.

<<Answer. The wounds will not be lethal, however, magicule reserves is likely to reduce dramatically.>>

As I suspected.

Thankfully it won't cause a lethal wound, but I would definitely sustain damage if I fail to block her attack. It would be dangerous for me to get hit by her multiple times in a row.

According to the analysis of Raphael-sama, that sword also possesses a special ability. Not only does it have the special wavelength to overwrite the natural laws, but it can even break through my "Multilayer Barrier s".

For real?! I couldn't help but ask this in my mind, but it must be the case since it's stated by Wisdom King Raphael-sensei.

<<...>>

Eh? What's going on?

<<Notice. Next wave of attack is arriving--->>

That was close, it seems that it is no time for me to ponder.

Hinata's sword is sharp and fierce beyond belief.

She is able to control her rapier at will, turning spurring to slashes fluently at ease. Moreover, Hinata's swordsmanship is very sound. She is not relying on any fancy techniques or magic but is relying on her mastery of sword alone.

In fact, only Hakurou would qualify to be able to confront me with a sword other than Hinata. But unfortunately, Hakurou probably won't be able to win. Their basic strengths are too different.

Considering all these, Hinata is almost a battle genius.

Any average attack can't possibly defeat her. For instance, "Clone" will be completely useless against an opponent like Hinata. Only the main body is capable of using the Ultimate Skills. In other words, the "Clone" that serves as the projection of yourself would at most be able to utilize Unique Skills. It will likely be instantly destroyed by Hinata.

Even if I copy Souei's "Clones" to equip them with essential skills, they would not be able to react to every one of these changes without being harmed. If that's the case, they would not be able to stand against Hinata.

I should stay away from using any trick to avoid revealing any openings to her. Although it would turn this into a protracted battle, it is better to wait until Hinata exhausts her stamina. After all, I don't really get tired.

Even though this is how I plan, Hinata's attack speed suddenly increased once more.

In fact, that's not accurate.

I couldn't even see its movement clearly.

I always evade based on the path of the sword I see, yet she launches her pursuing attacks almost as if she has seen through the mode of my movements. It would mean, eh, it doesn't seem to be the case...

<<Answer. She is luring you to a predetermined location in order to attack.>>

I see, so that's why---

No matter where I escape to, Hinata would be waiting there with her attacks prepared.

In other words, is Hinata manipulating my movements?

*Rip*, I hear the sound of my clothes being slashed open by her.

Since just now, the amount of scratches on me started to increase.

It is not enough to amount to critical injuries, but it feels like I will be killed by her if this continues.

This is bad. Really bad!

*Sensei, Raphael-sensei---!!*

Right now, I can only seek for sensei's wisdom.

Is there any good way out?

No, think of a solution fast!

---My wish seems to have been delivered as Wisdom King Raphael starts to respond.

<<Report. Skill 'Predict Future Attack' has been learnt. Apply skill? YES/NO >>

...

As expected of Master Raphael. It is really not for show.

This is the response I'd expect from Raphael-san.

I wasn't able to react in time when it first spoke of the matter, but now I know that I have acquired some incredible skill---

<<Answer. Not acquired, learnt.>>

Ah, okie.

Either is fine, I complain in heart.

So, Raphael explains as follows:

It speaks of its observation of Hinata's movements and that it has discovered that my opponent was able to handle my attack because she relied on a skill that predicted my attacks. And so, during my confrontation with Hinata, it has helped me to learn this skill through analyzing Hinata's attacks.

---Eh, is this really possible?

<<Answer. True.>>

It seems to be viable.

Well, since I've learnt the skill, such an explanation should not have been a bluff.

I need to apply it right away.

Suddenly a few trails of light appear before my eyes. It is a sort of sensation, or rather they are physically emerging in my mind?

One of the light trails suddenly starts to glow.

I swing my sword to hit that light, and interestingly, I was able to successfully block Hinata's sword.

It seems that these light trails indicate all the possible paths of attacks that the enemy can go for under the circumstance with the attacks following the direction of the trails. I tried it for several more times and discovered that sometimes the light trails would not glow.

This indicates that it is unable to predict the incoming attack path, meaning that it will be a complex attack from the enemy. In simpler terms, low level attacks such as a feint can all be predicted.

But since Hinata has mastered the art of sword, she was also able to strike out unpredictable attacks. The terrifying property of this skill is not its ability to predict, but that whatever it predicts is destined to happen.

It is not a prediction of an attack that is most likely to occur, instead, once successfully predicted, the attack will definitely land on the predicted path.

In other words---Hinata can no longer defeat me.

Her feints are no longer feints, or rather, it is a trick that would bring her own demise upon her.

I'm going to win---!

With swift movements and without any delay or hesitation, I try to evade Hinata's sword through the passage instructed by "Predict Future Attack" ---

![hard scene break]

It was a hunch.

That it would be a fatal misstep to continue her current pattern of attack---An unknown sixth sense is tempting in Hinata's mind.

Hinata has always enjoyed doing things in orderly fashion. She doesn't act without a basis or rationale, yet right now she has chosen to put faith in her instinct.

And so, she was saved. It was fortunate that Hinata forcefully changed her path of attack as soon as she launched a feint. More precisely, she was able to successfully attack by charging her body into Rimuru directly.

Rimuru also showed a surprised expression, but then raises his sword uncaringly at Hinata again.

Hinata also points her rapier at Rimuru.

However, something is not right.

The feeling that Rimuru is giving her is completely different now.

Hinata tries to launch a feint. It was an attack that can be easily blocked, yet Rimuru ignores it and slash directly at Hinata. The way he acted without hesitation raises doubts for Hinata that he has seen through her pattern.

*---Coincidence? No, it can't be... That was more accurate than my "Prediction Simulation" ---*

Indeed, it's almost predicting the future.

All in all, Hinata's thoughts seem to have been seen through by him.

*That's an incredible speed of growth. Although my sword skill is above him, he however has superior abilities to make up for his flaws. Now any average attack would not be of use. If that's the case---*

Hinata is very calmly comparing herself to Rimuru.

Right now, her chance of victory is surprisingly low.

Stalling for any longer would prove to be beneficial for her enemy---It was precisely because of this reason that she tried to resolve the fight sooner, yet this is how things have turned out to be.

She must abandon naive thoughts such as holding herself back to prevent taking lives in order to defeat such an opponent. Hinata has come to realize this.

Then, there is only one way left---

She must sacrifice her ultimate move that she is not supposed to use, in order to achieve victory.

She starts things over by distancing herself from Rimuru.

As time progresses, the people fighting in the surroundings are also in stalemate.

Suddenly, time seems to have been frozen as everyone drops their work at hand and soon begin to observe the battle between Hinata and Rimuru.

Neither of them can strike at their opponent.

For both of their predictions are extremely accurate that their opponent's next move would be predicted before they even try to execute it. The only thing in motion is time as every second passes.

Under such circumstance, Hinata speaks up.

"---Rimuru, I have a proposal."

"What is it?"

"Let us decide the outcome of our battle with my next strike. I'll use my ultimate ability to attack with my full power. If you can endure that, I'll accept your victory. And if not---"

"Will it mean my defeat?"

"Yes, that is right." ---Hinata nods her head while saying so.

"But, just to make it clear to you. This skill is extremely dangerous. Will you still accept my proposal if that's the case?"

*If it's Rimuru, he will probably accept.*

Besides, now that Hinata has just warned him beforehand, Rimuru shouldn't get killed by the skill then.

Now Hinata can be rest assured to give everything she has.

If she kills Rimuru, the Greater majins following Rimuru would probably turn into devilish monstrosities who will become nemesis to mankind.

Hinata, depleted with strength would be likely killed by them, and so will her subordinates, who are weaker than them, will be slaughtered. She doesn't want such a situation to become real, so she has to keep Rimuru alive.

This skill is supposed to be her instant kill technique against opponents who aren't prepared upon realizing its activation.

It is the Ultimate Skill (figuratively) of the holy sword---Melt Slash^[Or by Kanji "Slash to Decimate Magic spiritrons.].

It is an original skill created by Hinata that combines both magic and swordsmanship.

Its power is tremendous. That is why normally there is no way that she can alter her strength output to avoid killing her opponents, and that's why Hinata has avoided using it before.

*---Moreover, if I showed this to you, you might be able to learn it with ease. I don't like that either---*

This ultimate technique is only intended to be used against individuals that Hinata wishes to kill.

Yet it is quite concerning for Hinata to use it on Rimuru, who seems to be able to learn whatever skill he sees. But since there is no other way around, Hinata is forced to comply.

*---It is for this reason that I'll have to settle the fight with this!*

In order to have Rimuru admit his defeat, Hinata has to show him that he stands no chance against her.

![hard scene break]

"But, just to make it clear to you. This skill is extremely dangerous. Will you still accept my proposal if that's the case?"

Hinata says so.

She seems to be quite confident with the skill she is about to unleash.

But I don't get it.

Why is she informing me beforehand?

<<Answer. Hinata Sakaguchi seems to have no intention of killing you. Speculated reason of her warning being that the next wave of attack will be extremely dangerous. >>

I see.

So, Raphael said that she doesn't intend to kill me.

Eh? How strange?

Didn't Hinata come here to kill me?

In fact, I've been feeling odd about this from the very start.

---But it is too late to say all these.

I'll think about it later.

I can ask her in detail after winning this duel.

"Very well. I accept your challenge."

"Hehe, I knew you would say so."

Hinata replies with a smile after hearing my words.

Her eyes look so innocent that they seem to portray a much younger age than in reality. No, her appearance alone seems to have been stuck in the high school period.

The Hinata right now seems far more natural than the seasoned soldier that I encountered before.

That smile is not a mean or cruel mockery.

This may be the real Hinata.

"But, with this we will be even! If you lose, you should just be straightforward and swear not to ever lay your hand on this nation again!"

As soon as I spoke my words out loud, Hinata begins to twist her head out of confusion. But she immediately tosses away her doubts and nods in agreement:

"...? I see, I'll promise you that. I only came to duel with you since it was your wish. I would like to discuss that with you in the future as well."

I should feel happy that Hinata has accepted my proposal, but hold on a second, something about her reply sounded odd.

Eh?

"Did you just say that you only came to duel me because I wanted to do so...?"

"That's right. I've indeed received your message."

Hinata confirms my doubts.

The message I left was supposed to start with some cut-and-dried words to resolve the issues with Shizue-san and the children, then I expressed hope to negotiate with her.

In the end I summarized myself as follows---

"---I hope the two of us can talk, but if you are still not satisfied, I'll fight the fight with you. To avoid bothering others, let's have a one-to-one duel. Though if possible, I'd prefer we resolve things through peaceful negotiation. Please consider this. I await your reply. That's all, Goodbye."

I thought I'd clearly communicated my feelings; I certainly didn't wish to duel her.

Hinata seems like the really stubborn type, which is why I said those things about the duel in case she wouldn't have it any other way.

"Then, here I come."

"Hold on---!"

Oops, while I was lost in my recollection, Hinata has begun her attack.

There still seems to be some form of misunderstanding. But I don't think Hinata would listen with how everything has developed now.

Or rather, she is now in such deep focus that all sound would be filtered out like ambient noises.

On well.

All I have to do is to survive the attack to win. Easy peasy.

Let's talk about the results of the battle between people surrounding us. Benimaru and the rest seem to have won.^[More on their fights in side stories]

Some have been rendered unconscious, some are just sitting on the ground seemingly immobile due to exhaustion.

The only ones who are still fine are Benimaru and Souei.

It seems that the Beastketeers didn't activate "Beastilization" during battle, but their level of exhaustion is no less than the Holy Knights'.

And Souei... What's he been up to?

The female knight who was his opponent looks fine, but for some reason, she is gazing at him with blushed cheeks. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

She is acting all shy and petite, making me wonder what exactly happened there?

She totally looks like a girl in love who's fallen for Souei.

I mean, aren't you fighting a battle here?

I'll have to ask him about the details later.

Next is Shion.

She seems to have achieved complete victory and has brought the Holy Knights here. Although there seems to be some injuries, no one has died. The same is the case for the Holy Knights, who should be fine by applying some healing potions later. I should praise her for the good work. (and not losing her temper)

The issue remaining here is my duel with Hinata, and the next wave of attack will determine the result.

"Benimaru."

"Yes sir."

"In the unlikely event that I'm beaten, I'll leave the rest to you."

"Hehe, surely you jest. Everyone here believes that Rimuru-sama would emerge victorious."

Benimaru replies heartily which I could only shrug in response.

I suppose he's right. Unlike the computer I left in the other world, I can't just abandon my comrades in this world to their own devices.

I'm not that irresponsible.

"I see. Then just wait there for my triumphant return!"

"Yes sir! May you achieve great victory---"

I nod in response and turn my eyes to Hinata---

![hard scene break]

*It seems that everything has ended*---Hinata thinks to herself while observing the surrounding.

The sights of her exhausted subordinates enter her eyes, who are surprisingly well treated with much politeness. It must have been the strict order from Rimuru to prohibit the monsters from abusing the captives.

*Right, if only had I believed in your moral compass from the start...*

It is too late to think about this, but Hinata still believes so.

But it is still not too late.

She will build a new relationship by achieving victory here.

Hinata infuses her exalted mood into her prayer as she chants with a clear voice.

There is no need for this, but she wishes to show it to Rimuru. Since he may copy it in secret, she will show him the full version.

She casts "Disintegration". This power begins to gather on the empty left hand of Hinata, giving off a bright shine.

The sparkling particles intertwine to create a fantasy-like scenery.

Then Hinata imbues that light onto the body of her Moonlight Rapier.

---Her left hand slowly caresses the body of her sword.

The preparation is done.

She has infused her strongest magic with her sword art.

This is the technique that shall slash through all things in the world.

"Come now, have you made your resolve?"

"Bring it on!"

"Then take this---Melt Slash!"

Hinata finishes her words and turns into a beam of light, quickly approaching Rimuru.

![hard scene break]

What a bright light.

Not only her sword, but Hinata's entire body is glowing.

She is approaching me at superhuman speed with sparkling particles enchanted on herself. That is a speed beyond my imagination.

![exact fit image](image9)

That sword possesses the properties of eliminating evil, meaning it is effective against any monster.

<<Warning. Defense impossible, Evasion impossible---!>>

This is the first time I have heard such alarming report sounds from Wisdom King Raphael.

Even though my senses have been accelerated to millions of times faster, this light approaching me is still not slowing down.

Its speed is abnormally fast.

I have to act according to its distance and angle.

Hinata is aiming at my lower body, probably thinking that I won't die as long as my head is intact.

Speaking of which, this skill is still way too dangerous even if Hinata doesn't intend to kill me. There is no way to evade this, against this skill my "Multilayer Barrier s" are like thin veils of paper. Those lights are unleashing energy to destroy the spiritrons of any matters---The Beam of Evil Dispel. My body would probably burn to ashes as soon as I get in contact with it.

<<Report. Attack can be counteracted by sacrificing Ultimate Skill 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth', suggest adapting said strategy.>>

Even at this point, Wisdom King Raphael-sama is still reliable.

But honestly, it will be a huge loss to sacrifice "Gluttonous King Beelzebuth", but right now I can only follow this instruction. Since it is the solution suggested by Raphael that has the highest rate of success, I should not have any hesitation.

Ironically, it seems to be easier to lock onto her attack despite such high speed. Since it is so fast, there is no way for her to change her trajectory.

Wisdom King Raphael-sama has locked onto Hinata's location using "Predict Future Attack" and activated "Gluttonous King Beelzebuth".

The battle plan is to have "Gluttonous King Beelzebuth" consume everything as soon as Hinata's sword comes in contact with me.

Straightforward and simple, I have no need to hesitate.

Next---

Hinata's attack collides with "Gluttonous King Beelzebuth".

.........

......

...

As it turns out, I am alive.

I thought I was going to die, yet I didn't.

"Fufufu, fwHAHAHAHAHA!"

I collapse to the ground as Hinata's laughter travels to my ear. The magicule in the surrounding area has been completely cleansed, my "Universal Perception" seems to be malfunctioning as well.

Having not used my eardrums to hear sounds for quite some time, rather than being nostalgic, it ends up being pretty disorienting.

My body cannot move.

The moment I cancelled out Hinata's skill, I consumed a massive amount of magicule. Converting to damage, I've lost more than seventy percent of it in a go.

Never mind, as long as I'm alive... I couldn't have imagined that she had hidden such a terrifying attack. Had she used this without issuing a warning... Cold sweat drops began to flow down my back.

"You are good. Did you take my attack intentionally?"

Eh? What is Hinata talking about?

Who would be dumb enough as to intentionally take on such a dangerous attack?

<<...>>

Eh, hmm, could it be...

Feeling concerned that something about Raphael-sensei felt strange. I tried to inquire about it, yet Raphael kept silent. Something's definitely up.

"Since you've made it through my attack in one piece, as promised, I accept my defeat. I won't be able to continue this fight anyway---"

Hinata says so while disarming herself.

In a tone that seems to indicate the depletion of her strength.

Her powerful sword also disappeared after being consumed by my "Gluttonous King Beelzebuth". Right now, Hinata probably does not possess any combat ability anymore. With that being said, Hinata still straightens her back energetically and awaits my answer.

"Right. It is my victory---"

I announce the result to Hinata.

Although this does not resolve our problem.

As I plan to make my declaration of victory to Hinata, I catch on to a certain glowing object at the corner of my eye. Hinata also seems to have noticed as she turns her eyes to it as well.

In front of my eyes is a giant sword.

<<Warning. Target object has been measured to experience emitted telepathic interference and its magicule is out of control---object will explode imminently.>>

The object it is referring to is that giant sword. Someone is interfering with it, could it be that this giant sword is a means to harm us?

"Damn it! Have you really gone this far, Seven Luminaries ---!"

Hinata shouts out and rushes in front to protect the immobilized me.

And next instant, the shockwave and bright light of explosion arrive simultaneously.

At the blink of an eye---Hinata's body slowly collapses.
