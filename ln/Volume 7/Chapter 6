# Chapter 6: God and|Demon Lord

This is the kingdom of darkness. In this nation, there is a crypt hidden deep underground unknown to anyone.

There, a beautiful black-haired girl without clothes sealed inside a frozen coffin is in front of someone's eyes. The person before the girl carries herself without etiquette as she lies directly on the coffin.

Reveling in the moment, an enchanting smile hangs on her face. There is a faint blush on her pure and smooth white skin. This young lady sighs with overwhelmed emotion.

*Ah, how beautiful. Ah...*

Privately, it is a personal hobby for her to enjoy watching and caressing the girl in the frozen coffin.

This petite silver-haired young lady.

She has a pair of heterochromatic eyes---One blue, one red, each glow with seductive shine.

They are eye-catching even when contrasting to her incredibly beautiful face, making the young lady's beauty even more outstanding.

However, her most eye-catching features are none other than---

The two white fangs slightly emerging from the young lady's cute lips. When she opens up her petite lips, the crimson blood-like tongue would appear alongside her white fangs.

She is the ruler of dark nights, "Queen of Nightmares" ---Demon Lord Luminas Valentine.

Every time she touches this frozen coffin, a burn-like scar appears on Luminas's beautiful body.

For this is a holy ark. It is a container for pure energy of the Holy Spirit, and so Luminas would naturally sustain injuries. As a Vampiric Demon Lord, this coffin is undoubtedly poisonous to her.

And yet, Luminas doesn't mind it at all.

These injuries are the utmost joy to her.

Even with the immense power Luminas possesses as a Demon Lord, she would not be able to destroy this coffin.

Since Luminas dreams of one day liberating the young girl slumbering within, she has come to tease with her at the frozen coffin again...

It was then that her trusted subordinate brings the news.

"My most sincere apologies for interrupting you, but there is something I need to report."

The one reporting is Louis.

He was granted the position of "Pope" in Holy Empire of Lubelius under Luminas's rule.

Luminas suppresses her displeasure---Since Louis seldom comes looking for her, so it must have been something extremely urgent.

"I see it is Louis who's caused all the fuss. What is it?"

Louis explains briefly to Luminas's question.

"Hinata wished to resolve things with Rimuru, which I permitted. However, the situation seems to have complicated."

"---What do you mean?"

"As I mentioned---"

Louis begins to recount the findings of his investigation.

"Is that so...How troublesome."

Luminas says so with a gloomy tone as she withdraws from the frozen coffin.

She summons her servant after leaving the crypt.

"Gunther!"

"Yes, I am here---"

An elderly butler emerges from the dark. He is the ancient vampire servant of Luminas who attended the Walpurgis Banquet with her.

Alongside Louis with similar status, he is one of the "Three Counts" ^[There is no specificification of their ranking. So count it is because vampire.] under Luminas's reign.

There is Louis who is in charge of the Pope's Ministry. While Gunther governs the Night Garden. As well as the now deceased Roy who disguised himself as the enemy to act as the Demon Lord's double.

Among their other duties, the three work as Luminas's bodyguard in shifts.

Given that Luminas is staying in the crypt of Night Garden, it is Gunther who is guarding by her side. He dresses Luminas. You can tell the formality of their dress code given that they are not using magic to dress instantly.

As he is helping Luminas, Gunther heatedly scolds Louis.

"How bold of you to interrupt Luminas-sama with such trivial matters---"

"My sincerest apologies. However, if let unattended, Luminas-sama would bear the misfortune of losing her beloved pet."

"It is precisely that which makes it trivial. However, we should indeed be cautious to have her fight against that Demon Lord Rimuru..."

"I came to inform my lord to prevent that. If Hinata is killed, Luminas-sama would---"

At the end of her patience, Luminas comes between the two to stop the quarrel.

"Louis, cut your words short, and you too Gunther. Won't it be fine if I move out myself? In case there's any trouble."

The "Three Counts" all dislike when they interfere each other's field of duty, and this character of them is also one of the reasons why Luminas gets headaches in life.

Aware of this, Louis decides to make a concession for Gunther.

"Yes, I am most ashamed of my behavior."

"My most sincere apologies---"

The two both bow in apology after being scolded by Luminas.

She groaned in exasperation, and gives her orders to the two.

"With Roy being gone, we will have to reassign duties. But there is no time for that now. You two should both come with me for now."

Luminas commands with majesty and begins to move out.

"Understood."

"I shall pledge my service."

The two majin obey happily as she leads them away.

Luminas suddenly pauses in her tracks. She turns back to the holy cabinet containing her slumbering beloved.

*Just you wait---*

Luminas whispers the name of her dear young girl.

With her words said, she caresses the crypt gate with pity and seals it down tightly. Being sealed by Luminas's powerful magical barrier, the crypt sinks into the pitch-black void...

![hard scene break]

A leader of the secret organization "Cerberus" ---Damrada the Gold has arrived in the Kingdom of Farmus following his secret meeting with the five elders.

He is traveling to the Nedler territory located at the border.

He is on good terms with Earl Nedler McMunn thanks to the frequent gifts he sent. These efforts gained the trust of the covetous Earl. And Damrada was able to sneak his men into the city through bribing alone.

Now that he has learned where Edmalis is hiding in the city, it won't be long before this land becomes the ground zero of chaos.

It's also been confirmed that the new king Edward has led an army of twenty-thousand men to form camp near the domain of Edmalis. The Hero Youm is sheltering King Edmalis---They will have the new king Edward spread this as a public announcement of a collusion between the two. He will also emphasize on the claim that Edmalis has signed the treaty of ceasefire without authorization. And now that the new king has gained control, Edward will not carry out the accord.

However, he will have to demonstrate his "good faith"---through claiming to the public that Edmalis and Youm have embezzled the reparations.

To the people living in cities, a hero who can only fight wars is of no use for them. Since they live much safer lives than those by the border, they do not understand the necessity of a defensive force. Some are even bitter over their taxes being wasted on these heroes who do nothing. Considering the amount spent on the citizens' personal safety, their lack of such common sense is truly laughable.

Now, with the news out that the Hero Youm and old king Edmalis have seized the reparations, the upper echelons of the Kingdom of Farmus are infuriated. There are increasingly more people volunteering themselves to aid the new king in their capture. Everyone now believes that Edward is the justified one, and so he has exploited this public opinion to lead the army.

If this continues, Youm and Edmalis would be defamed and executed. It's obvious that the two would not stand for this.

The threat of war is looming over this place.

And it's all according to Damrada's plan.

This land originally only had Youm's five thousand soldiers, yet three days ago, more reinforcements started arriving.

*Hmm, of course Demon Lord Rimuru would not allow Youm to meet his demise like this. Naive, how terribly naive. In that case, Hinata the Saint's odds are looking good. Then, it may be time for me to withdraw...*

To Damrada however, this is also within his expectations.

It was only his personal wish to take care of Hinata. Since the lies he told to Hinata may have been revealed, he wants to get rid of her before she becomes a problem. She won't let Damrada walk free. And if he is to continue to act among the Western Nations, he has to keep that in mind.

With that being said, the issue concerning Hinata will have to depend on the Five Elders. This opponent is perhaps too dangerous for Damrada to take on directly.

*Never mind. As long as our plan doesn't fail...*

The head^[The term used here is "総帥" which means "General" or "Commander in chief"] of "Cerberus" only ordered him to stir war in this land. In other words, his mission has been completed. It is best for him to withdraw before Hinata returns.

But his work is not done yet---Though Damrada doesn't care whether the new king or the hero triumph, he will need to carry out the promise made with the Five Elders.

That is to eliminate the demon...

The plan has already changed as things have developed.

According to the investigation of the meetings by Earl Nedler, it seems that the demon also wants to resolve the war in short period of time.

What should he do now---Damrada begins to ponder.

The new king's goal, the demon's motive.

The two are in direct opposition.

The new king does not wish to antagonize Demon Lord Rimuru. Their difference in military strength is night and day. He will not be able to win even with his whole country on the march.

Yet Demon Lord Rimuru is reinforcing the Hero Youm, meaning he doesn't mind a war. The new king's claim of upholding justice became meaningless the moment that the Demon Lord decided to help the old king.

The situation has changed.

Moreover, something else has been on Damrada's mind.

While investigating for the demon elimination task, he discovered that the majin Razen has not been serving the old king, but is under the order of this demon that Damrada is to kill.

It means...could it be that the majin Razen was not defeated by Demon Lord Rimuru, but by the demon under Rimuru's command? Then it can't possibly be the incarnation of any contemporary or modern breed of archdemon. It must be some far more ancient demon...

Damrada's face stiffened upon thinking so.

There isn't enough information. Even the information received from his boss doesn't have anything about this type of demon.

He should consider it as modern breed that has lived at least hundreds of years... Damrada concludes.

Among archdemons, their power varies depending on the years and age they were born. The breeds that were born in recent years may be fine to deal with, but the modern breeds that have lived for two or three hundred years would make a fierce foe to rival the power of a Calamity Rank threat. Moreover, if it is the medieval breed of demon that has lived for nearly a thousand years, its power would be similar to that of a Demon Lord's lieutenant. Even if it is evolved from Lesser Demon, its power is still not to be underestimated.

Once such a demon is born, it will pose very a challenging threat to mankind.

By the way, the most powerful breed of demon that would even acknowledge a human contract is the medieval breed. Summoning any demon higher than that would only bring destruction. A successful summoner would be out of luck and can only wait to be deprived of their souls by the demon.

According to the latest research of the Eastern Empire, it has become common sense to set a limit during summoning. However, the only people who are capable of summoning archdemons the few "Hero" class masters...

"With that being said, if it is majin Razen..."

Damrada couldn't help but mutter.

Indeed, the name of majin Razen is quite well-known even in the Empire side. His power should not lose to any medieval breed demon. If a demon who is able to defeat the powerful Razen does exist---

Besides, the Five Elders seem to be plotting something as well. Damrada is interested in their plan, but his instincts tell him that getting any more involved would be dangerous.

I'd better get away before I get caught up in anything---

He plans as such.

"Damrada-sama, what is going on?"

Damrada's subordinate notices him talking to himself and asks.

Damrada slants his eye at the subordinate and grins.

"Hehehehe, how dangerous. I can't continue this charade. I've already messaged them to stay put, now we will really have to be cautious."

"...?"

"Let's withdraw. Leave two men behind to observe the situation and clear everyone else out of the country."

"Understood, sir. But what about you?"

"I'm gonna pay my respect to the new king and then check out the Monster Kingdom."

"But weren't we going to act cautiously?"

"Hmm? Hehehe, of course we will. But I'm not doing anything shady, rather, to use my disguise identity as a merchant to request an audience with the Demon Lord Rimuru-sama. I'd love to have the privilege of becoming a new business partner of his, and intend to gain his favor by any means necessary."

"I see, I understand now. Then, what should we do with the six contractors from the Contact Association (Contractor) hired from the empire?"

"It is because of them that I am paying a visit to the new king. They are my greeting gift to him."

"I see, so are we pushing the rest of the duties all to Edward?"

"What a bad way to put it. I'm simply doing the new king a favor while carrying out the deal I made with the Five Elders."

The so-called Contract Association is an organization similar to the Freedom Association in the Western Nations. They commission professionals, some of whom are demon slayers that make their living hunting demons. They are specialists in battling demons who only earned their license for being the toughest among monster fighters.

Damrada has spent a fortune hiring them from his home country to have them demonstrate their strength on this land. But he has revised the original plan after sensing danger.

"But, is there really a need to be so alerted? We won't make back our investment this way..."

"Hell if I know. Maybe I'm just overthinking it, but I trust my instincts. I'm not stupid enough to lose my life over a maybe."

"I apologize if I've offended you just now. I shall go prepare for our departure."

"All right, I will go pack another gift for the new king."

With nothing else to be said, his subordinate exits the room.

Now that they've properly prepared, it is time for Damrada to leave Nedler's territory.

It is the right call.

At this crucial point of time, Damrada has escaped this dangerous land that's been locked on by the raging eyes of one very angry demon.

![hard scene break]

New king Edward can't hold in his excitement.

With the unstopping aid arriving from nobles around the kingdom, his military power is gradually increasing.

He didn't expect the Hero Youm's decision to support his elder brother Edmalis, and when Demon Lord Rimuru reinforced Youm with troops, he prepared himself for the plan to fail.

Yet even so, God has not abandoned Edward.

The situation changed when Archbishop Reyhiem was murdered. He didn't expect that Saint Hinata would move to confront Demon Lord Rimuru. It's rumored that she is marching alongside the Holy Knight Order.

Moreover, the heroes of Holy Empire of Lubelius have volunteered to assist Edward. They are the Pope's Imperial Guards---Including the legendary "Three Martial Sages" who are surpassed only by Hinata. These people have mobilized the Templar Knight Order to join in his battle.

Although they have yet to proclaim their enemy as the "Nemesis of God", it seems that it is only a matter of time before it becomes official. The group's main goal is to hunt down the demon that murdered Archbishop Reyhiem, however, that is merely an excuse---Edward deduces that their true intention is to form a grand alliance, the so called United Army of Western Nations in order to battle against Demon Lord Rimuru.

For this reason, Edward has given them permission to conduct whatever they wish in the Kingdom of Farmus, even military operations. He personally does not wish to fight against Demon Lord Rimuru, but it hardly matters at this point of time.

Hinata can't possibly lose to the Demon Lord, and with such a mighty army, even the Demon Lord's army will be defeated---This is Edward's conclusion. The problem is Veldora... If it really is that carefree and temperamental evil dragon, the Western Holy Church should be moving all its force to seal it again.

The only thing left is justification, but that question is resolved as well. Some powerful "Eastern" Merchant has visited Edward and provided him a letter from Earl Nedler.

The letter states a request for Edward to "rescue" him.

Now that all the problems have been resolved, Edward is confident of his victory.

With the reinforcement arriving at the border of the kingdom and the justification of rescuing Nedler, he should move now.

He made the decision without hesitation.

He is not actually going to war, but the deployment of the army in the streets and around the city will pose quite the menacing effect.

It is Edward's misfortune that no one was there to advise him.

He gives the order to march.

![hard scene break]

*The plan has been drastically altered*, Glenda thinks to herself.

But this is quite common on the battlefield. It is important to quickly adapt and turn the situation for the better.

Thinking in that direction, things are in fact not too bad.

Every Kingdom is very concerned about the development of this incident, and many reporters have gathered.

The situation is prepared according to the plan. Although they never expected that Rimuru would split his army while dealing with Hinata, it only helped Glenda as he diverted his military force. He has made the wrong move, Glenda concludes.

In essence, there shouldn't be any issue.

Damrada seems to have escaped, but he has left a team specialized for demon slaying to King Edward as a token of friendship. She is looking forward to the performances of these fierce warriors above Rank A.

*Good, I'll just use them as disposable pawns then.*

Glenda awaits her order casually like that.

Her confidence in defeating the demon has kept Glenda optimistic.

However, said confidence will not last long...

![hard scene break]

*Kufufufufu.*

Diablo, the demon---laughs evilly.

His wide-spread wings are like those of a bat, demonstrating a wicked sight.

He is searching the battlefield from the sky to find the person who framed him. Diablo would not permit such embarrassment of himself in front of his beloved master Rimuru. He has never experienced the taste of fear since his birth, yet the thought of losing his job sends a shiver down his spine.

*If Rimuru-sama says "You can go back now" again*---He shivers at the thought. Imagining it alone is already painful, more painful than having his body torn apart.

Those people who caused him such fear will know his true colors.

Diablo's laughter intensifies upon thinking so.

And soon Diablo discovers Edward, the new king, at the back of the formation.

There are also several individuals who stand out from the rest. But to Diablo, they are no more than street trash.

However, they seem to be worthy of standing before Diablo---*Then they must be the "Ten Great Saints" or something.*

Had it not been for Rimuru's hope that his force would "avoid harming the innocent", this would be much easier... Diablo is not alone in thinking this---even Hakurou who is supposed to monitor him, agrees.

Of course, Diablo wouldn't harm the soldiers who don't intend to resist, but it's different for those who attack him. Moreover, he has no mercy for fools who launch an attack without considering their comrades.

Suppressing his eager mood to "greet" them, Diablo informs Hakurou through "Telepathy Net".

"Hakurou-san, there is someone quite unusual heading towards your direction. He should help Ranga-san to kill some time."

"Oh, understood. Will it be a problem if we don't kill him?"

"Not at all. That man must be related to the rumor from Lubelius. I wish to take him alive as a bargaining chip."

"I understand. I shall relay the message to Ranga-san."

"Also... That guy is leading five thousand soldiers. By the standard of Freedom Association , the group contains members who exceed Rank A."

"Hmm. Perfect timing. I am going to send Gobta and Gabil there."

"Great, that's a wonderful idea. The chances of their defeat are minimal---"

"Mmm, rest assured. With me overseeing everything, you can do as you wish."

"I'm most reassured by your words. Then, excuse me for a while."

"Don't overplay your hand."

Diablo informs Hakurou of the information he has gathered from investigation.

He can't hold himself back anymore and decides to abandon his concerns. He launches himself towards his prey.

New king Edward freezes as Diablo appears in front of him.

Sare---who he was tasting black tea with---is no exception, the sudden occurrence catching him off guard.

"Greetings everyone, I don't believe we've been acquainted. Though, King Edward, I should say it's been a while. My name is Diablo."

Diablo descended from the sky, not forgetting to greet the two by bowing afterward.

"Everyone spread out! Raise your guard and protect King Edward!"

The knight commander commands out loud, not allowing Diablo finish his greeting.

On the order, the Imperial Knights quickly carry Edward to the back. A wall of men is formed to protect them.

The knights of the Pope's Imperial Guards put up their guard and entered formation as soon as they saw Diablo. They push themselves forward before Edward and the rest.

Diablo remains silent and relaxed while waiting for these panicked bunch to finish their preparation. Now that he's knows his target, the rest is simple. That's why there is no need for him to rush.

The campsite is set up with military tents.

Diablo now stands before the luxurious-looking tent reserved for the king as Sare and his subordinates quickly surround him. Yet Diablo still seems to have a delighted expression as no one notices the fury burning in his eyes.

The reporters are all scared out of their wits, wanting to know what is going on. Diablo's smile to them doesn't weaken.

"I have no intention of harming you so long as you be a doll and stay put."

With that, Diablo puts his fingers together with a crisp *snap*.

Upon making the sound, the reporters are all surrounded by "Barrier". This is Diablo's attempt to prevent them from being affected. The intention behind his words are "Don't call me ruthless if you dare step out of that barrier". But the reporters are happier not realizing so.

The preparation is done, and Edward has come back to his senses.

"Why if it isn't Demon Lord Rimuru's honorable envoy? To what do we owe the pleasure?"

Despite somewhat lacking in majesty, Edward asks Diablo in such tone while putting on the facade of haughtiness.

Diablo soon answers.

"Kufufufufu, just one simple matter. I came with a warning."

"Warning? What sort of warning?"

"Retreat your army now and make peace with Youm-san. By doing so, you shall all be exempted from the torment of fear you can't possibly imagine."

With formality in mind, he starts off the conversation negotiating for peace.

However, this is not Diablo's real intention. It will be more troublesome if they are willing to make peace.

"Hahaha, what a strange way to phrase things. When it comes down to it, this began when my brother embezzled your reparations. I've only marched my army here to demonstrate our sincerity to your nation and retrieve that money. You have no right to meddle with this!"

"I see. Do you then suggest that everything will be going according to our peace treaty?"

"Of course. However, it doesn't seem to be necessary now, since I've been deceived as well!"

"How is that the case?"

"Oh, quit your lies! You and my brother---No, you've colluded with Edmalis and those liars in hopes of extorting twice the reparations from our kingdom. I've already seen through your despicable goal."

"..."

"Do you have nothing to say? That Rimuru guy is not much of a Demon Lord. Aren't you trying to plant the seed of war only to extort money from it?"

"..."

"How unfortunate however, you murdered Archbishop Reyhiem-sama in order to silence him, but all of his words have been recorded here loud and clear!"

Diablo's silence encouraged Edward's put forth more arrogant speech.

He then raises the crystal ball in his hand high for the reporters to see clearly. The film displays what seems to be Reyhiem under interrogation. He shouts in the film: "I've not betrayed you! Please forgive me, forgive me!"

Anyone would believe that it is the footage before his death.

"Which proves?"

Edward laughs and answers with disdain at Diablo's question:

"Don't you understand? Glenda-san brought this to us. Did you not infiltrate Lubelius and murder Reyhiem-sama? You thought you could get your way by threatening him, but his faith in God has triumphed the fear you imposed! You must have killed him fearing that he will expose this to the public!"

Edward puts on an imposing expression as he looks at Diablo.

Yet Diablo's face is still covered with smile.

"How wonderful. You claim that a mere "human" could overcome their fear of me? What an amusing joke."

"Quit playing dumb! We have enough evidence, so don't think you can talk your way---"

"Enough. Shut your mouth."

Edward wanted to show off his authority to the reporters before he was interrupted by Diablo's calm voice.

The smile on Diablo's face suddenly disappears.

In its place, it is replaced with a hollow and terrifying expression.

![exact fit image](image11)

"This charade ends now. I intended to enjoy a mind game with you, yet you don't even possess a worthy intellect."

Edward becomes frozen in place at Diablo's assertion.

"I was going to find out the truth and prove my innocence. But it seems to be unnecessary. Since you humans only believe what you wish to believe, there should be an easier way to prove it---"

"W-what do you mean...?"

Fear emerges in Edward's heart as the aura emitted by Diablo changes. He finally comes to a terrifying question---Did I do something wrong?

Then, Diablo declares:

"Don't you wish to prove it? It would be my defeat if any one of you can overcome this fear. But, just a heads-up for you, I'm yet to see anyone achieve that to this day. So, you'd better find your resolve when standing against me."

His gentle words contrast with the raging fire that is burning inside the red pupils of his golden eyes.

Diablo could have endured it were Edward's comments directed at him alone, but he dragged Rimuru into this claiming that he is some sort of evil being.

With those words, Edward's life was forfeit.

Edward, terrified, begins to shout:

"All of you, move out and kill this guy! Kill this dangerous demon---"

The demon slayers among Edward's bodyguards have been waiting for this order.

They drop out one by one and launch their attacks on Diablo.

"Overcoming fear? I'm laughing my ass off here! Don't get so arrogant just because you are the highest ranked demon species of archdemon^[FYI, this is likely only referring to the highest rank of demon that can be summoned and commanded.], demons with your ranking are no rarity in our hometown."

"Your demon race can't maintain their form without their flesh! It is no different for archdemons!"

"We've been studying the techniques to fight Demons all our lives, don't underestimate humans!"

The demon slayers shout out one by one as they collaborate in forming their killing formation.

But in contrary to their words, they are not being careless at all. Since Diablo has just stated his name.

A "Named" archdemon is far more dangerous.

"What is it now, are you incapable of even giving a response?"

"You're all talk in the end after all."

The demon slayers tied Diablo up tightly with chains made of special holy-element alloys.

Due to the ease of this attack, they lowered their guard against Diablo.

Unlike in the Western Nations, demons have caused many problems in the Eastern Empire. It is rumored that this is due to the existence of a base set up by a powerful demon there. But because of this, they were able to develop special tactics against demons. Even the archdemons---considered a mythical existence in the west---will not survive. The people of the east have categorized the power of demons into different ranks in order to study methods to subdue them.

The leader of the demon slayers has recognized Diablo as a medieval breed. But with the additional consideration of it being "Named", he has changed his judgement to recognize this demon as a threat to rival the ancient breed.

These are demons who bear the rank of Noble, possessing immense power and a wealth of knowledge. This type of threat has been known to even lead a number of vassals, so it cannot be underestimated.

With that being said however, the leader still believes there is a chance for the demon slayers to win. He has in fact had the experience of fighting several archdemons in the past. This confidence made him to arrive at this conclusion without a doubt.

"Are you ready now?"

The leader is shocked by Diablo's rhetorical question.

"W-what?"

"Nothing, please give me a signal to fight when you are properly prepared."

The leader couldn't understand what Diablo meant for a while seeing he still seemed to be very energetic.

"...Oh? Does it mean that you won't interfere no matter what we do?"

The leader hides his panic and provokes Diablo with words.

"Why would I do that? It's rare to see people working so hard, so I won't interfere. After all, I can inspire the greatest amount of fear this way."

"Hehehehe, don't look down on us, demon. You will know how arrogant you are when we turn you into ashes!"

Diablo answered jokingly, sending chills up the demon slayers' spine.

Most demons are indeed overconfident and despise humans. Hence, Diablo's speech alone is nothing remarkable. Yet this is coming from someone whose entire body has been tied up. Even these veterans in demon slaying feel unease in the face of such overwhelming confidence.

With that being said, they are professionals. They have been rigorously trained to act without hesitation and quickly complete their jobs.

"---Then, repent for your arrogance in the next world! Eliminate him, Sextuple Thunder Strike (Thunderbolt)---!"

King Edward, reporters from different nations, Sare, and the Imperial Knights from Lubelius are all watching.

A blinding bolt of lightning strikes to incinerate Diablo.

"How about that! How does it feel being struck by a natural thunderbolt instead of a magical one^[Lightening that deals natural elemental damage instead of elemental magic damage (which uses mana/magicule).]?"

"Aren't you Demons protected by "Multiple" Defensive Barriers? Too bad! The empire has researched the spell to break right through them!"

"In order for Demons to affect the physical world, you require a body! With your flesh destroyed, you're at the end of the road!"

The demon slayers say so with great confidence.

Attacks launched using magicules are easily blocked by the "Barriers" that directly interfere with them. For this reason, they decided to develop weapons that don't make use of magicules. This Thunderbolt is one of the new weapons designed to be used against demons.

Hearing their words, the fear in Edward's heart evaporated.

"Wonderful! As expected of warriors from the "East". I'll have to reward that merchant."

Edward says so delightfully, smirking at Diablo with a twisted expression.

The lightning is incinerating Diablo.

*Incinerating... But is it really burning him?*

Even enveloped in that lightning, a smile still hangs on Diablo's lips.

The only two people who notice something amiss are Sare and Glenda.

The leader of the demon slayers also begins to realize something is wrong.

*---How strange. Too strange! Why are his clothes not burning along with him?*

Feeling doubts, he soon discovers something---His opponent is wearing an evil grin.

"Y-you---!"

"Kufufufufu, how weak. You are all too weak. You wish to challenge me with such pathetic power? How disappointing is it that you've wasted all of that effort."

As he says this, Diablo slightly raises his arm.

With his arm lifted, the chains bound around Diablo are deflected.

"UHH!"

"WUHH!"

Diablo displays an incredibly immense force that breaks the special alloy chains around him.

"M-monster!"

The leader unintentionally spat in astonishment.

Diablo cracks a smile, continuing nonchalantly.

"Well, next stop, we have some other tests to do."

"H-hold on! Isn't this too abnormal! How could the Thunderbolt be ineffective?"

The leader suddenly demands, either rejecting reality or trying to calm himself.

Hearing this, Diablo gives him the answer gently.

"You wish to know why? It's very simple. I have high resistance against all natural attacks, including lightning. If you're curious, I didn't even need to deploy a defensive barrier for your attack just now, it was like a weak sting to me."

*Are you satisfied now?* He adds.

The leader begins to quiver.

But his reaction is considerably better than the others.

Seemingly realizing the meaning of Diablo's words---

"WA-WOAH---! Get away from me, stop, stay away!"

"KYAAA---! Help, HELP ME!"

The rest of the teammates have all wet themselves and began to yowl incomprehensibly.

These are the reactions of the fierce, first-class demon slayers who have seen it all on the battlefield.

But it's not over yet.

Apart from the reporters who are being protected, the observers at the scene felt a shiver run down their spines. As for Edward, he fainted and has foam drooling out of his mouth.

It is the same for his bodyguards.

*What happened?*

The leader finally understands.

*This... Intense sense of dread*---It's the oppressive aura of this demon before him. All Diablo did was release the demonic aura he had been suppressing.

Yet this aura is already strong enough to kill humans.

"Ara? Only three of you passed my test? That's fine, you have my applause. Even though I'm being generous, you still all managed to endure my "Demon Lord Haki (Imposing Aura)". I shall allow you to face me in a fight."

Fear is almost suffocating the leader at this point, upon hearing Diablo's words, he turns his head back.

He can see only two people standing. They are the qualified individuals Diablo mentioned.

A young boy and a wild beauty---Sare and Glenda.

Seeing that the two have remained calm, the leader resolves himself with some confidence retrieved.

It's all right, I can still turn the table around. As the top heroes of the west, it is expected from the "Three Martial Sages". Even if subordinates fell, we have a chance with these two around...

Having received some back up, the leader is filled with fighting spirit once more and turns to Diablo.

"Hehehehe, impressive, as expected from a demon under the Demon Lord. But you are also quite the poser."

"Are you implying that I am bluffing?"

"Yes, bluffing indeed. Didn't you just mention "Demon Lord Haki" ? That is a skill only available to monsters of the "Demon Lord Seed". A demon's final stage of evolution is archdemon, there is no way you can become a "Demon Lord Seed" ! Your words are nothing but bluffs!"

This is a top secret found from research in the East.

There is a limit to the amount of magicules a demon can store. This amount does not differ greatly between demons, while their strength does. In other words, the strength of ancient demons comes from their experience making them more efficient in utilizing this power.

It has also become something of a proof that shows there is no need for humans to fear demons.

If you know their limits, you can react to whatever a demon does. Knowledge is power---a demon's bluffs cannot affect someone who can see through them.

"I see. Half of what you say is true. Us demons indeed have a maximum magicule capacity, but we can still evolve under the right conditions."

"Huh?"

"For example, isn't Rouge quite famous from where you came?"

"'Rouge'? What are you talking..."

As the leader spoke, the image of a certain demon's came to his mind. That demon is too famous, too reputable, he is considered an exception...

"Moreover, it is actually quite easy to meet the criteria of becoming a Demon Lord. You simply have to raise your power to that limit and endure for over two thousand years. That's it."

Despite how casual Diablo put it, such transformation is in fact extremely difficult.

The Demons are astral lifeforms and a war-loving species. They would fight each other day and night in the spirit world even without being summoned. Not only will defeat lead to a decrease in their total magicule storage, they may even end up devolving.

To raise your power to maximum and endure for two thousand years---It means that there is no room for defeat after the demon evolves to an archdemon, which is no mean feat.

The leader of the demon slayers has yet to realized this message from Diablo's words, but he can tell that he is talking about something supernatural.

What concerns him more is the fact that---Diablo directly spoke of the name "Rouge".

He dared call the name of that prominent demon overlord.

*No, there can't be such a thing---*

The relationship between demon ranks is absolute---This theory was proposed by the great magister of the Eastern Empire, Master Gadra.

This strict rank hierarchy is clear when facing a clan's primordial king, and it applies for all of those with high rank.

For a demon of lower authority to directly address his superior in name is as impossible as the sun rising in the west.

"If you are born in the east, the name "Blanc" is probably more significant. I sensed her "Demon Lord Haki" in the east a while back---"

The leader freezes in astonishment at what Diablo's words bring to mind.

Several years ago, "Blanc" ---That horrifying Primordial White appeared in this world and was nearly incarnated.

The "Lake shore dyed in scarlet incident".

It could have very well given birth to a second Guy Crimson.

It was that close to destroying the balance between the Demon Lords and plunging the world into chaos.

They gambled on the prestige of the empire to bury the incident.

The leader's face tenses as he comes back to senses.

"Rouge" and "Blanc" ---This demon before him addressed them so casually, implying a similar status to them.

*H-how could...how could this be...* He began to wail silently.

*C-can't...can't win against him! This is madness. How is this happening!*

And so, he yields. He surrenders immediately.

Demon slaying is but an occupation, he is not going to bet his life on something beyond his pay grade.

He may do it to protect his friends and family, but dying like this in a foreign land... Moreover, the difference between the parties is large enough to make one despair. Knowing that resistance is futile, of course he chose to give up.

"Please have mercy! Spare my pitiful life, I beg you, I beg you!"

With no concern for honor, the leader fell to his knees to plead with Diablo.

Diablo shows a very gentle smile at this sight.

"Ara, what's wrong? Don't you want to have some fun after passing my test? Don't you want to find out? You will know whether I was bluffing or not when you experience it for yourself."

The leader continues to plead in response. He understands Diablo's true identity is extremely dangerous and doesn't doubt any of his words. There is no way on earth that it was a bluff.

"Please forgive me and spare my life! I'm just doing this for the money. I won't dare to stand against you in the future, I swear! I won't get in the way of your business. I'd even kill the fainted king over there if you so demand! So please, spare me!"

Without caring about the looks he is getting; the leader continues his unseemly begging. And so, his efforts are rewarded.

"Sure, get lost then. Go to that barrier set up for the reporters. Get everyone in my way in there as well."

Diablo has lost interest in the leader and announces so.

The leader obeys and complies without hesitation.

He wakes up his subordinates and makes them carry the fainted knights away as he takes the king and escapes into the "Barrier" himself.

Not one of the reporters say a word.

Under such abnormal circumstances, they can only watch nervously...

![soft scene break]

In the now empty camp, Sare stands in front of Diablo with an uncaring smile.

"Oh, you are pretty impressive. You look nothing like a Calamity-ranked archdemon."

"...? Are you not going to run away?"

"Run away? That's funny. I am Sare, member of the Pope's Imperial Guards under the rule of Lubelius. I am one of the "Three Martial Sages" within the "Ten Great Saints", enemies of the Demon Lords. So, who are you really?"

"I just announced my name, it is Diablo. It is my "Name" granted by his majesty and my liege Rimuru-sama."

"...Do you not plan to reveal your true identity?"

Sare is playing it off, but this humiliation is causing his heart to pump furiously.

"Whether you can overcome this fear"---or whatever---Diablo's words were complete insults to Sare's ears.

Only his rationality is keeping him calm. Although he wouldn't lose himself over some trivial anger, he doesn't like Diablo's scornful look at him.

The demon slayers from the "East" were laughable. They labeled themselves experts in battling demons. Yet as if begging on their knees is not embarrassing enough, they all ran away in the end. A bunch of cowards.

Sare had played along as Glenda thought they could be useful pawns, but he hadn't thought the result could be so disappointing...

*They are but average people in the end. In comparison, us vanguards of his excellence the pope and even the God Luminas carry far greater responsibility, and so our resolve in battle is nothing like theirs.*

Upon thinking so, Sare disparages those demon slayers.

With that being said, he wouldn't lower his guard against Diablo.

*Grigori wanted to fight as well, but this is my prey. And so, I'll make you regret looking down on me.*

The name Diablo is not found in any historical document. With an unknown name, he can't have the kind of power that will pose a threat. All he did was address "Rouge" and "Blanc" directly. What's so scary about such a bluff?

*It may be different if he is an unnamed "Primordial"* ---Sare thinks to himself.

He is aware that his opponent is no mere archdemon, but Sare has concluded that there is no threat to himself.

The tragedy of ignorance---His knowledge of demons is not extensive enough.

Sare begins to ponder.

Since his opponent doesn't intend to reveal his true identity, he will force the demon to show his true color. After all, Sare alone possesses the strength to battle a Demon Lord.

Even if Demon Lord Valentine unfortunately escaped during Sare's pursuit, he was able to push the Demon Lord one foot into hell. There is no reason to be afraid of a mere archdemon.

That's why Sare cannot stand Diablo's attitude... But he soon begins to wonder if he is hearing things as he listens to Diablo.

"---True identity, is it? Right, I forgot about it since I'm not interested in power ranking. As you said, I am no archdemon as you claimed. I've evolved to Demon Noble. It is not much different, but I still hope you won't mistake it."

The demon explains in a calm tone.

To Diablo, his "Name" matters far more than his rank, but while he may have no interest in such a thing, it is a huge deal in Sare's eyes.

Sare is panicking.

He can't nor wishes to believe.

What did this demon in front of him just say?

Did he just mention "Demon Noble" ?

"Demon Noble" ---A legendary existence, designated as a Disaster-ranked threat undisclosed to the public.

And their power is greater than the average Demon Lord.

It is hard to imagine even Greater Spirits standing against it. Only several Spirit Kings attacking at the same time could deal with one. The only records of their actions in this world are in ancient texts. Though...they have been confirmed to exist.

The proof is the existence of the strongest Demon Lord---

Sare quickly considers what this means.

He didn't take those tales seriously, that archdemons who have become "Demon Lord Seed" would, under the right conditions and surviving after thousands of years, would evolve to "Demon Noble". If that is the case, it is only natural for such a being to have extraordinary power.

At the very least, it would have magicule storage several times larger than an archdemon's and the experience gained through many years of survival.

---His power would be limitless.

The leader of the demon lord slayers observing the battle from afar fainted on the spot after hearing the phrase "Demon Noble".

It is an impulse from his heart. Fear arose after imagining himself against Diablo and the ending that would have awaited him. He passed out in sheer gratitude for his good luck in escaping such danger.

However, no one who noticed accused him for his state.

Sare also wishes to flee now.

The more horrifying fact however, it's that someone would be stupid enough to name such rare archdemon so casually.

*Demon Lord Rimuru, what the hell were you thinking---!*

Sare realizes that every pore on his body is in cold sweat.

This is bad---His instincts are screaming in his head.

The fighting spirit he had held onto has all dissipated.

He knows he can't win this fight.

Normally, as a "Named Monster" with no master is easily controlled by others, he would not announce his name right away.

Considering this demon announced his name without hesitation, Demon Lord Rimuru has indeed given it to him.

*---But, naming an archdemon, is this Rimuru really able to do that right after becoming a Demon Lord?*

It is irrelevant now, but Sare still couldn't help but worry about the matter. He is merely trying to escape reality.

And it is in that moment that Sare hears someone's voice.

"What are you waiting for, Sare! Let's hurry up and take care of this *sexy* demon!"

Glenda shouts.

"You idiot! Stop it, Glenda!"

Sare tries to stop her, but it's already too late.

Glenda was like the wind as she snuck up to Diablo without making a sound. Then, without faltering, she then plunged a black dagger into the demon.

The dagger heads directly towards Diablo's heart.

"Huh! You are not so impressive after all!"

Glenda laughs as she feels the knife collides.

However---

Unfortunately, Diablo didn't intend to evade in the first place.

"Kufufufufu, what extraordinary bodily functions. But unfortunately, you won't be able to harm me with physical attacks."

Diablo announces light-heartedly.

In fact, he has also acquired the skill "Physical Attack Nullification".

"Tsk, how annoying!"

Glenda quickly draws away.

Ignoring Sare's advice, she continues to launch attacks without pause.

She is now aware that Diablo is a strong enemy, and she is no longer underestimating her opponent as before, but fighting this demon as if he is a Demon Lord.

However, it amounts to child's play in Diablo's eyes. The difference in power is simply too great, and all of Glenda's actions have been in vain.

She begins to realize this---or rather has known it from the start.

And so, Glenda's actual goal is---

Being left with no choice now, Sare can only make his resolve.

He doesn't want to leave Glenda to fight all by herself.

First, he releases his spirit power, pushing his body to its limit. Then he launches his expensive special-grade weapon "Evil Slayer (Demon Slayer)" at Diablo.

However, these attacks are no different.

"Dammit, the sword really is useless! Glenda, buy me a little time! I'll cast "Holy Magic" ---"

Right now, he can only rely on using the strongest magic to defeat his foe---Sare judges, hoping that Glenda would buy him some time.

Yet Glenda is not responding.

A cruel line is tossed at Sare.

"If that was meant for your female companion, she just ran away at full speed."

Sare couldn't quite understand the meaning of Diablo's words.

*It can't be?!* He thinks to himself while looking back, yet Glenda is nowhere to be seen. Just as Diablo said, she fled the scene.

"God dammit---!"

Sare bellows in order to rid himself of the frustration, but there's nothing he can do.

Sare has to clean up Glenda's mess for having acted out on her own.

Although he is furious, right now he is still confronted with this grinning demon. Considering the circumstances, Sare should be more concerned about his own well-being than Glenda's desertion.

*I'll fight then, I'll fight the damn fight! I just have to hold on until Grigori gets back!*

Hoping for his trusted ally to return, Sare lights his fighting spirit once more.

Grigori only went to the town to lure out the demon, with his target here, it won't be long until he returns.

Sare is certain of this, and so he commences his own desperate battle, albeit with almost no hope of victory.

![hard scene break]

While Sare is knee deep in battle, another member of the "Three Martial Sages", Grigori has also gotten himself in a desperate spot.

Galloping through the battlefield, he was nearly crushed by a disaster falling from the sky in front of him.

The mercenaries hired by Youm are fighting to defend the town gate. They're good enough to hold off the vanguard assault.

However, they are not Grigori's prey. He didn't consider the civil war in Farmus any of his business. His only goal is to hunt down the demon that is said to have murdered Archbishop Reyhiem. He has received reports that show that this demon is maneuvering in the city, and so Grigori came in person to eliminate it.

*There are people from the "East" under King Edward now. If I don't get out there to fight now, there won't be any chance for me to fight at all.*

So did Grigori plan.

But now, instead of the demon, he is confronted by a terrifying giant wolf. He rushes to dismount.

This giant wolf that appeared in front of Grigori is of course Ranga.

He is wagging his tail joyfully while sprinting in the air.

His body is light as feather. He couldn't feel his feet stomping on the ground and has already unknowingly flown into the sky. This is the skill "Shuttle Fly" only acquired by few bestial monsters, yet he has picked up the skill naturally.

But to Ranga, none of this is important. He has no interest in anything but enjoying this liberating power. He is hopping around the sky with ferocity, displaying the depth of his magicule storage. His dark, furry limbs are covered with sparkling golden lightning. Ranga is not lessening his leaking aura and is electrifying the air around him.

The horn on his forehead shines with a golden light like a crown as he uses it to control lightning.

His imposing presence is exaggerated by his charged dark furs, like a cape sewn with darkness, displaying Ranga's status of the Wolven King.

He was running at supersonic speed in the air and quickly spotted the group as mentioned by Diablo. It didn't take long for him to descend next to Grigori.

Grigori is accompanied by several knights of the Pope's Imperial Guards. The second battalion made up of five thousand soldiers are all Farmus Knights sent as reinforcement by King Edward.

"Uh, Grigori-sama, what should we do?"

The noble general leading the Farmus Knights asks Grigori.

*How should I know*. Grigori thinks to himself.

The relatively more skillful knights were all eliminated during the last march, and now all that is left are these crooked soldiers with inferior knowledge who can't even qualify as second class. Expecting them to be capable of thinking is already asking too much. This guy is asking for a foreigner, Grigori's opinion without feeling the slightest bit of shame.

"General Caston, you go handle the troops that are about to arrive. Aren't they both ground and airborne?"

Caston understands now that it has been explained by Grigori.

"I see. But what about Grigori-sama...?"

"Me? What do you think? I'll of course be having some fun with that guy over there. Paisen, Carusia, protect General Cas---"

As he was about to give his order, a black whirlwind blows by Grigori.

"---UHH!"

Since Grigori only just noticed, Ranga continued to assault the troops led by General Caston at the same speed.

"Shit, you filthy dog!"

Grigori is furious.

He violently stabs his Halberd^[Two handed polearm that combines a spear and axe] towards Ranga, but it is evaded with ease.

Ranga then begins to go on a rampage, bouncing around like a puppy who has just discovered snow.

As he continues, the casualties pile up---Paisen, Carucia and some of the Imperial Guards have all become Ranga's prey and been trampled to the ground.

In the end, Ranga finally decides to launch himself at Grigori---

Gobta and Gabil are desperately chasing behind Ranga.

"Ranga-san, you are running too fast..."

"Right! We won't have a chance to fight if you continue like this."

"Brother, stop complaining and catch up to him already."

Gabil and Souka quarrel back and forth.

They are enjoy arguing with each other like always, but everyone knows that they have good relationship. The only ones who don't see it are themselves.

"Let's get going then!"

"All right, copy that!"

Gobta moves out first using his "Shadow Step".

With him are the hundred members of the Goblin Rider troop.

Gabil begins to fly alongside the hundred members of the Hiryuu.

Next, Souka leaves to report to Hakurou, who is in charge of commanding the troops.

Gobta is the first to arrive at the battlefield. He witnesses the huge amount of soldier bodies lying in a concentrated area.^[they are not dead btw]

The rest of the knights are distancing themselves from Ranga while surrounding him, praying that Grigori would emerge victorious against Ranga.

The fallen soldiers are all skillful veterans. They charged at Ranga in order to cover Grigori, yet were easily defeated in only a couple of hits.

Ranga steps on the defeated knights without killing them and sends them flying away with his front legs. That's why a bunch of knights are all lying in the same spot. As for the knights praying on the side, they all look desperate. At first, there were still people energetically cheering, but right now they have all fallen silent.

That is because...

Grigori is covered in wounds.

Hoping to win at this point is delusional.

Grigori possesses the ideal skill of "Immovable" that gives him an indestructible body. Yet to Ranga, he is just a tougher toy to break. Moreover, Grigori cannot faint, and so he is tormented by pain for a long period of time.

"Hold on! This doesn't look good, Ranga-san! You'll kill him if you continue!"

"Right! We have to treat his wounds now---"

Gabil and Gobta arrive to stop Ranga.

Having been informed, Ranga pauses his movement. He finally starts to notice the terrible sights around him. His tail starts to hang down out of frustration, he even begins to shrink in size.

"---Uh, hmm. But, could I at least play a bit more with this guy...?"

Still holding onto his broken Halberd, Grigori is exhausted. Ranga pokes at him with his front feet while saying so reluctantly. Feeling too much pity for Grigori, Gobta and Gabil begin to persuade Ranga. They couldn't leave the matter alone after imagining themselves in the enemies' shoes.

"No, no no no no, you shouldn't do it!"

"T-that's right! If you don't stop, Rimuru-sama would be pissed!"

Ranga finally complies after the two mentioned Rimuru's name.

"That'd be bad. I'll get scolded if I continue---"

Ranga looks at Gabil and Gobta with a sad expression before choosing to give up.

![exact fit image](image12)

Grigori is released.

Ranga's sticky drool is all over his body and his limbs are also bent at weird angles. It's only to a small degree, but the angles of these bends have exceeded their normal range of motion, making it obvious that Grigori has sustained severe injuries.

It's a miracle that he is still alive after sustaining such critical injuries.

But Grigori managed to survive. No sequelae were caused by the injuries as the healing potions that Gobta and the rest prepared instantly restored him.

However, the same can't be said about his mental health---

Grigori would later be known famously as the "Dog-hating Immovable Fortress", and no one would know the reason behind it...

If you retreat right now, we will not pursue any longer---Hearing these words from Gabil, General Caston complies without hesitation. He even ordered the troops charging the town gate to retreat as well.

"How can we win this! We don't have a chance---!"

With this final line, this battle will go down as a (in)famous incident in history.

And as such, the battle in the Nedler region concluded without even officially starting.

![hard scene break]

*Come on, come back sooner, Grigori!* Sare prays desperately.

Right now, Grigori is being transported on Ranga's back.

He should be arriving soon as Sare wished.

---But it may not be as he expects. Sare is lucky that he is oblivious to the fact.

*Now that I think about it*---Sare thinks to himself.

This demon called Diablo is powerful beyond belief. Even Sare, as one of the very few powerful individuals in the human world, cannot clearly see the limit of Diablo's power.

Sare would no longer question Diablo's words.

He is a monster even stronger than Demon Lord Valentine, so he didn't need to kill Archbishop Reyhiem. As he said himself, no one would possibly dare to defy him after the slightest intimidation.

*If that's the case, how did I end up here...?*

Right now, Sare is defending himself against Diablo's attack with all he has, but he is reaching his limit both in terms of his stamina and psyche.

"Kufufufufu, you should put in more effort now to show me some interesting skill."

Sare wants to cry hearing how delighted Diablo sounds.

He wants to go home.

Everyone called him a genius.

Due to his elven bloodline, he was granted the gift of longevity. Moreover, he has obtained the Unique Skill 'Omnipotent One' ^[The kanji translation of this skill "万能者" sounds very powerful, however the actual katakana explanation given by Fuse says "デキルモノ", or in hiragana "できるもの", which means "Things that can be done". Pretty weird stuff.] through intense training.

He can understand the opponent's techniques with just one look, in addition, this amazing skill also gives him the opportunity to learn from the opponent's techniques. It is a similar mechanism to Hinata's Unique Skill 'Usurper', both serve to strengthen the users' power.

In order to master the learnt techniques, he naturally requires rigorous training to improve body functions. Sare is deeply aware of the principle behind his skill and has mastered many different abilities using it.

He has even learnt combined techniques of magic and skills, which are the hardest to learn. It is a technique that allows him to imbue a magic effect into his own fighting spirit in order to produce powerful sword slashes.

This "Qi Slash" ^[Qi - Pronounce "Chi" or "Ki" in Japanese- refers to aura or life energy. A word from Chinese culture.] is a basic skill from the "Qi Fighting Techniques", but at the same time, an ultimate art^[Not referring to Ultimate Skill]. On its basis, it gives the user the magic attributes to counter the enemies' weakness. In this way, it makes up for the ultimate instant-kill techniques used to cut down all monsters.

---Sare brags about the skill in his heart.

But it was useless.

Diablo immediately analyzed the structure of Sare's magic and decomposed it as soon as it was about to activate. If Sare can't interfere with the truth of the world, he cannot overwrite laws, and no miracle would occur.

Sare has given up using magic and is strictly relying on "Qi Fighting Techniques" and "Qi Sword Art" to fight.

"Dammit..."

He mutters regretfully.

What is angering Sare the most is that he realizes that Diablo has not been fighting him seriously at all.

In terms of magic techniques, the difference between the two is similar to the difference between an adult and infant child. The same can be said about their physical ability, the only thing unlike this however---The abundant training of their techniques, in which Sare is on par with Diablo. Yet just now within a span of few minutes, Diablo demonstrated incredible growth speed. If it is the present Diablo, had he wanted to, he could kill Sare without a sweat.

He's not doing so, so he indeed...

It means---Diablo indeed doesn't wish to take Sare's life.

Then, the culprit of the murder of Archbishop Reyhiem is someone else, as for who---

Right. Boss's plan was never related to the civil war in Farmus. It only happened after she went on the expedition, almost as if it has happened for that timing. In other words, it would be---

Very suspicious, actually, no.

It must be the case---The "Seven Luminary Clerics" are the true culprits.

Sare is convinced of this.

And at that very moment---

"Sare, we've come at your aid."

"Be grateful and let us eliminate this demon together!"

"Continue to suppress the demon until we take care of him with magic."

The space behind Sare begins to distort as some powerful figures emerge.

Three sages appear---the masters of the Seven Luminaries.

The Seven Luminaries are not doing as they've said, instead they are preparing to cast magic that will bring great danger to this entire area.

The culprits are attempting to destroy the evidence.

And the so-called evidence would be the people here who have discovered that Diablo was not responsible for killing Archbishop Reyhiem.

The reporters of the other nations are no fools. Just like how Sare has pieced together the clues, a few also have realized the truth.

It is the reasonable course of things considering it is also part of Diablo's plan.

*In other words, however, the target of "Seven Luminary Clerics" is not Diablo---*

"Dammit, all of you, run away *now*!"

Sare sends his warning to the reporters as a giant fireball appears, devouring everything at the scene.

![hard scene break]

Hinata's chest is pierced by a heat ray.

I immediately hold up Hinata.

"Oi, are you all right?"

"Gu, huh."

Hinata begins to vomit blood.

She painfully presses her hand against her chest while trying to cast magic but couldn't manage to do it. She can't even make a sound to use magic. Hinata has lost all her strength, and collapsed onto my body.

My clothes are being dyed red as she continues to bleed. If this continues, Hinata will die without an explanation...

I'll investigate later about what just happened.

I take out some healing potion from "Stomach" and spray it onto her chest. Normally the body would immediately start to regenerate, yet it isn't working this time.

<<Answer. Subject "Hinata Sakaguchi" seems to possess high resistance against magic. Her body will automatically disintegrate magicules to nullify the effect.>>

Magic nullification, is that what you mean?

"M-magic doesn't work on Hinata-sama. It's the same for healing magic, any non-holy magic system would all be nullified..."

Hinata's subordinate---Arnaud hurried over, shaking his head as he said so.

If that's the case, will "Holy Magic" without magicule constituent work?

Regardless, my healing potion doesn't seem to work here.

If that's the case---

"Right, don't just stand there now, come and cast healing magic on her!"

Let's apply the most effective method.

Hinata is still alive. She still has a chance to recover with the healing of "Holy Magic".

After being scolded by me, Arnaud and the rest begin to take action.

However, they are suddenly prevented from doing so.

Glowing circles appear that bind Arnaud and the rest.

Several powerful individuals have arrived by dimension leaping using advanced teleportation magic to tie Arnaud and the rest up.

The two mysterious figures suddenly appear and kneel before me.

Then---

"Demon Lord Rimuru, we've not met before. We are the "Seven Luminary Clerics". We've come to take care of Hinata Sakaguchi who has defied our orders---"

They say so without a shred of shame.

Hinata lies on the ground, her consciousness fading.

Arnaud and the rest are tied up.

The mysterious duo suddenly emerged out of nowhere.

Speaking of the "Seven Luminary Clerics", I recall hearing about them, that they are the people Adalmann hates the most.

How very suspicious.

But since I'm interested in investigating the situation, I can't really say it out loud under the current circumstance.

"I have no idea of your quarrel, but do not interfere me saving Hinata. We've made amends, so I won't let Hinata die."

When I finished my words, the Seven Luminaries reject my request with dramatic gestures.

"Unfortunately, that cannot be allowed. This person---Hinata, she has ignored the holy will of the god Luminas. That is an unforgivable outrage and she needs to face the divine judgement."

All self-important, he starts talking as he wishes in others' domain.

"B-but!"

"Please forgive Hinata-sama! She has her reason---"

The Holy Knights jump in to defend Hinata, but the sages don't seem to be listening to their words.

But then, one of the Holy Knights shouts emotionally.

"S-Stop screwing around! You crooks are the ones that deceived me! You were planning from the start to have Hinata-sama killed---"

This man was Shion's opponent, the captain that led the hundred Knights.

However, the situation continues to escalate in its mystery.

The colleague next to him suddenly draws his sword and stabs the captain.

"---Wha---Garde, w-what are you..."

"How rude of you, Renard, to speak those malicious words about the prestigious masters of the Seven Luminaries, I can't just sit and watch as you do. You must have conspired with that traitor Hinata to deceive us all!"

As Garde shouts out his words, the tied up Holy Knights also feel shaken.

Whose words here are real? They must also be confused.

Does this alone indicate the immense authority held by the Seven Luminaries ?

No, things shouldn't be that simple.

The heat ray that pierced through Hinata seemed to have come from the direction of Garde, which means---

By the way, this is really giving me a headache.

Things have gotten so chaotic and out of control.

I want to save the dying Hinata, yet the Seven Luminaries appeared to stop me, and now this Renard was conspired against and is now having his life taken hostage.

Moreover, these Seven Luminaries mentioned that they came here to deal with Hinata who has defied orders. At the very least, these people don't seem to be antagonizing me.

What should I do next then...

The foremost thing I want to do is to save Hinata.

On one hand, it was one of the requests from Shizue-san, and secondly, I felt that our misunderstanding was so close to being resolved. If I can make peace with Hinata, it would seem that I may be able to build a friendly relationship with the Western Holy Church and even the Holy Empire of Lubelius. Me sitting here and letting Hinata die on her own is not an option.

"I'll listen to your justification later. This is my kingdom, and you shall all obey the "Law" of my nation. That's why you, the one called Arnaud, right? Quickly cast healing magic on Hinata---"

My kingdom doesn't actually have laws, but I want to use this excuse to force them into compliance.

However, the Seven Luminaries refuse to back down.

"That simply cannot be. Us believers of the Luminas Sect have pledged our loyalty to the god Luminas. We will not deviate from our belief. Even if it is a request from the Demon Lord Rimuru, we will not comply either."

They also brought up a bunch of things concerning doctrines in order to hold back the Holy Knights.

How annoying.

There is no time to waste with them, I'll have to force my will on them---Just as the thought crossed my mind, Diablo sends back a message through "Telepathy Net".

"Rimuru-sama. I have urgent matters to report---"

"What is it? We are busy here as well so make it quick."

"Excuse me, but we've found out the real culprits behind the murder of Archbishop Reyhiem. There seems to be a group of people pulling strings from behind the scenes, called the Seven Luminaries."

"Oh..."

"In addition, there are three of them in front me right now, allowing them to live will only lead to future grievances---"

"Can you gather evidence to prove that they are the culprits?"

"Many foreign reporters here are all witnesses---"

"---I'll permit it. Exterminate them."

"At this instant!"

Nice timing.

Diablo did a great job at passing the news in time. I have no idea how things worked out so perfectly to this point but handing them over for Diablo to deal with seemed to be the right call.

Now all the mysteries are resolved.

So, the real culprits are the Seven Luminaries. I have no clue what their goal is, but it would seem they've not come for me, but Hinata. Perhaps it won't work in their favor if Hinata is still alive. They decided to use a scheme like this as beating her by pure force is not at all easy.

The guy who just backstabbed the Holy Knight called Renard must have secretly colluded with the Seven Luminaries. He may even be one of its members.

The culprit that shot at Hinata must have been this Garde. He probably did that in an attempt to assassinate Hinata, but doing so in front of me was his biggest mistake.

To commit a crime within the range of my "Universal Perception" is no different from confessing your crime.^[But didn't your mana get drained and you couldn't use your skill and all. Fuse detail please explain.]

My message for Hinata appears to have been distorted as well, probably by the same group of people. This was their plan to disrupt Diablo.

In any case, now that I know these people are the culprits, I have no need to show any concern over our relationship with Holy Empire of Lubelius and be generous to them.

You are in my kingdom.

I did consider about keeping them alive, but they've also given me a lot of trouble as well. I'd say there is no need to show mercy, rather than letting them run away, we might as well take care of them now.

I've already given Diablo the green light to what he wants, so here I shall do things my way.

Well then, let's relieve some of the negative emotions^[The phrase here is "怨念" which means resentment or grudge feelings.] I had to endure today.

"Benimaru, Souei!"

" "Yes sir!" "

"Detain those two. If they dare to resist, I permit you both to fight violence with violence."

"I was just waiting for your order!"

"Leave it to me. I shall obey Rimuru-sama's order."

Benimaru and Souei approaches the Seven Luminaries.

The Seven Luminaries start to look at me with a hateful glare before they could get to them.

I ignore them and continued to give out my next order.

"Shion!"

"Yes!"

"I'll leave that Garde to you."

"!"

"Don't get careless, he may be disguised by one of the "Seven Celestial"."

"I see! I'll just have to rip off their masks and show them hell!"

Shion unsheathes her Odachi with joy written all over her face.

I won't stop her this time. And honestly, I'm looking forward to what she will do.

"Ku, kukuku, oh my, this is bad..."

"Are you sure about this? It will mean waging total war with us!"

The two members of the "Seven Celestial" start spouting nonsense.

Leaving them alive will only plant the seeds for future disaster. If you do something, do it thoroughly.

"You guys overplayed your card. I've seen through the fact that you murdered Archbishop Reyhiem and tried to frame it on us. It was you who came knocking on our door for a fight, so have you made your resolve?"

With my words out, the Holy Knights begin to look at each other with confusion. But some show expressions of realization.

As for Arnaud, he is infuriated to the extent of pointing his sword at the Seven Luminaries.

The Seven Luminaries however are not moved by how the situation has developed.

On top of which, they begin to howl with laughter.

"Kukuku, I can't believe we've been exposed."

"WHAHAHA! But the "Saint" is already dead! Demon Lord Rimuru, aren't you also exhausted by your fight with Hinata?"

"How does it make sense for us to not use such wonderful opportunity!"

"Since you've all learnt the truth, we might as well take care of you alongside the Demon Lord!"

No longer concealing their intents, the Seven Luminaries reveal their true natures.

And so, laughter filled with devious intent start to echo at the scene.

Their acts are so low that they make me want to vomit. There is no need to show mercy to these kinds of people.

Benimaru, Souei as well as Shion all move out. They've begun to launch their attacks on their respective prey.

However, the cunningness of the Seven Luminaries may have exceeded my expectation.

"You fools! It's commendable that you've seen through our intent, but we've already prepared for this situation, just in case."

"We planned to kill everyone from the start!"

"Hehehe, then let us begin---"

The two members of the Seven Luminaries declare as they quickly distance themselves by floating to mid-air. Shion was about to attack Garde when he too floated into the air as his true self.

Soon after, a wide magic circle began to be constructed with the three as vertices. Indeed, it does look like an incredibly dangerous attack that cannot have been done without preparation. Its range naturally didn't cover just us, but including the two Beastketeers and the Holy Knights.

It seems that they are going to kill everyone in order to completely erase all evidence.

"Black Flame Prison (Hellflare)---!"

"Web Slash of Monsters."

The black flame fireball that bears hellflare and the "Sticky Steel Web" that can cut through even steel overflow and cover the targets. Yet it is only met with a wave of maniacal laughter.

"Futile, you are wasting your effort. This circle will dispel everything except the holy-element! That's why the attacks from you evil monsters will not work at all."

"Kuhahahah, you fools. Human wisdom has accumulated over the millennium. And you monsters have been arrogant and full of yourselves for your power, we will definitely not lose to you animals!"

I can't withdraw myself in midst of their high-pitched laughter as I am desperately trying to sustain Hinata's life.

I am using my body as her substitute heart, yet she really does reject magicules. I seldom do such a thing with the addition of low compatibility; I'm not doing a good job just like the time I tried to save Myuran.^[Somewhat confusing line considering that rescue went pretty well.]

However, my worries are lifted when Shion charges head onto them.

"Shut up! That thing won't work against my "Hercules Ex" !"

She seems quite confident with those bizarre words she just shouted, probably without going through her head, Shion swings her sword at the Seven Luminaries at full force. Normally it would seem that she is no different from any blockhead, but it is Shion after all.

"HAHAHAHAH! Idiot, what do you think that sword can---?"

The Seven Luminaries were busy mocking her before they notice crisp sound of the space in front of them cracking.

"T-this is bad!"

"Not good, the magic circle may collapse at this rate."

"We've already come so far, so let's just cast immediately!"

Shion's almost impossible attack had nothing to do with any attribute, it was purely relied on her brute force, in addition with that something---

<<Answer. Concluded that she has utilized Unique Skill 'Cook' and "Guaranteed Outcome" to overwrite the phenomenon--->>

Shion is truly reckless.

She is the only person I don't wish to make an enemy of.

<<Warning. Although improbable, attacks from individual "Shion" may cause damage to master. >>

Are you serious?

I'd better stay on Shion's good side.

Once again, I've come to realize how strong Shion really is. But unfortunately, even this was not enough to stop the attacks of the Seven Luminaries.

<<Warning. Incoming attack.>>

Construction of the large-scale extermination magic seems to have been finished.

Dammit, what should I do---

<<Report. There is no problem. Analyze and Assess of the magic circle has been completed.>>

A calm and reliable voice comforts me seeing how worried I am.

Eh, ah, okay.

It sounds like there is no problem, but that magic circle seems to be pretty complex... No, it must have been only a tiny problem for Wisdom King Raphael-san to solve.

It is quite indecent to interrupt when the "Seven Luminary Clerics" are all so confident about themselves, but all of you won't stand a chance when Raphael-san gets serious.

" " "Die! Trinity Break---!" " "

The three's voices overlap as they activate the magic.

But it is meaningless at this point.

"Report. Reactivating Ultimate Skill 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth'."

As Raphael announces, the killing beams that start pouring from the sky are consumed cleanly by my "Gluttonous King Beelzebuth".

Wow, what an incredible power when optimized.

As the killing beams vanish before their eyes, the Holy Knights all stare with their eyes wide open.

But speaking of which, how strange? Hold on a second?

Didn't I just sacrifice "Gluttonous King Beelzebuth" in order to deal with Hinata's attack...

<<Answer. It indeed sacrificed Ultimate Skill 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth', but it won't pose an issue since a copy of the skill has been made.>>

What did you say? A copy?

Eh, why did you say as if it's a trivial matter. Couldn't you have just told me so from the start?

And I thought I couldn't use it again.

It is already past tense for Raphael-san, but I still seem to hold a grudge for it.

<<Warning. Reactions from spiritrons have intensified. Main attack incoming.>>

Oh yeah, so that was not the main attack.

" " "We shall end you now, Demon Lord! Trinity Disintegration!" " "

Damn! I don't think "Gluttonous King Beelzebuth" will make through this one.

<<Answer. No problem. Activate "Absolute Defense" of Ultimate Skill 'Covenant King Uriel' ? YES/NO>>

Oh, as expected from Raphael!^[I'm dying to not insert a sasuga, sasuga me.]

Of course I would choose YES, eh?

I suddenly have a strange feeling.

As I was concerned over it, the "Absolute Defense" of "Covenant King Uriel" were activated for the first time. I feel as though my skin is being covered by a thin layer of transparent membrane.

With this layer of membrane--- "Absolute Defense" as blockade, "Trinity Disintegration" is completely countered.

![soft scene break]

Speaking of this, I now recall.

That was the first time I activated it.

Before that I've only relied on "Multi-Barrier" instead of "Absolute Defense". With my "Thought Acceleration" raised to the maximum overdrive, I raised a question to Wisdom King Raphael.

Oi, why didn't you just activate this before? Against Hinata's attack as well, shouldn't this be able to block it as well?

To my question, Wisdom King Raphael-san gives me a jaw-dropping answer.

I am completely baffled. Because---

<<Answer. Even if activated 'Absolute Defense' of 'Covenant King Uriel', spiritron may still penetrate. Hence, activating said skill prior is meaningless.>>

---Just like that, it makes it sound very justified.

Even the biggest perfectionist would have a limit to things, Wisdom King Raphael-san...

Spiritrons are the special particles that make up magicules, their motion is extremely hard to predict. The spiritrons can move through the barrier of space and time. The principle that governs these random phase changes---the law of natural motion in spiritron---if not decoded, even my 'Absolute Defense' would be penetrated.

But right now, my 'Absolute Defense' has perfectly defended against 'Trinity Disintegration'.

So how did Raphael-san so perfectly predict the movement of spiritrons?

<<Answer. The attack just now--- "Melt Slash" was canceled by 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' and engaged by 'Predation' at the same time. The information gathered then was successful in analyzing the random motion of spiritrons. That is why defense mechanism was able to predict the attack of holy-element. In addition, you've obtained Holy Sword technique "Melt Slash". >>

Right...

Hmm? Wait, hold on a second...

Eh? It would mean that, you let me intentionally get hit by Hinata's sword...?

<<...>>

Oi! How dare you remain silent now!

Its reaction is almost saying "Oh shit!"

In other words, its silence was its acquiescence.

Eh? But...

Hold on? Wisdom King Raphael-san wouldn't make such dangerous gambit, so could it be...

---That even if I didn't use "Gluttonous King Beelzebuth" to cancel the attack, I wouldn't be killed even when hit by "Melt Slash" head on?

<<Answer. Of course not. Speculate to consume massive amount of magicule, however, the physical body can be instantly revived through "Endless Regeneration".>>

...

Then what were you nervous about?

Or perhaps, did you *want* to analyze "Melt Slash" by consuming it?

<<...>>

My my, are you at it again?

This guy is getting smoother in answering questions. Should I say that it has become more human-like or calculative.

I would believe without a doubt if it says that it has already possessed consciousness.

---But then again---

It is one of my wishes. It apparently wanted to learn the attack after surviving it.

Will you always put yourself out to fulfill a wish that may disappear in a blink of an eye?

If that's the case, then this super-duper invincible skill (Wisdom King Raphael) is simply too amazing. It is truly a waste to give me such power.

<<False. I was born only for my master.>>

It immediately denies.

Oh, thanks.

I'll be relying on you in the future as well, partner!

---But, try your best not to hide anything from me in the future.

And so, during this stretched out time, I had this conversation with Wisdom King Raphael, which converted to normal speed of time would only have lasted for an instant.

![soft scene break]

"Impossible, how could it be---!"

"This can't be real, how can something like this even happen!"

"There is no one in the world who can survive a direct hit of "Disintegration" ---"

Etc. Etc.

The three sages are in extreme panic.

I suppose they should be.

Even I who took the hit felt that I was a little too over the top.

Their attack not only was the strongest in Holy Magic, it was also stacked with three layers, granting it with absolute destructive power. Yet I blocked it with ease. It is only natural for them to be astounded and refusing to accept reality.

But unfortunately, this indeed is the reality.

The only reason why you've failed is that you've pissed me---actually, that you've stood against Wisdom King Raphael.

"All right, it's our turn now."

With my words out, Benimaru, Souei and Shion nod along.

"Now that your proud magic circle is gone, can you endure it this time?"

Benimaru says so while toying the black flame in his hand.

The Seven Luminaries turn cowardice as soon as they see this.

They seem to be very anxious after using their trump card.

"Don't even think about running, trash. You better start praying!"

Shion comments on her prey as she gives off a terrifying smile.

Souei remains silent, but he is closely observing every move of the Seven Luminaries.

The Beastketeers Alvis and Suphia also join in, overlooking all of the Holy Knights from the sky to pressurize them. I think there shouldn't be any dangerous individual among them, but keeping an eye out wouldn't cost anything. If there is anyone suspicious in the mix, he will not have a chance to cause any trouble.

"Uh..."

The Seven Luminaries have been cornered. Yet they still don't intend to give up even facing such a circumstance.

"Think about it for a second! We are the guardians of mankind! If you kill us, the believers of Luminas will not just sit and watch!"

"Indeed! The fury of the God Luminas will consume you!"

"We shall retreat for now. Now that we know you are no evil being, we shall say a few words of praise for you in the Western Nations. Let us just be good neighbors in the future---"

They interchange threatening and conciliating frequently to continue to negotiate arrogantly.

How truly annoying, it's about time to shut them up---And just when I have the thought...

"---Demon Lord Rimuru, sorry for the trouble."

A piercing sound is suddenly made.

A slit is slashed across the space, followed by the appearance of a giant gate.

The gate opens to reveal a beautiful young girl behind.

One with unique silver hair and heterochromatic eyes---It is none other than Demon Lord Valentine herself that came for a visit.

Why are you here? I would seem pretty silly asking this.

"Gu... Ahhh!"

"You... Aren't you---!" ^[The second "you" here changed to a more polite pronoun, consider changing from you to "your excellence"]

"Why have your grace visited such a place---"

The Seven Luminaries are shocked, moreover, their arrogance disappeared in an instant.

They drop on their knees in fear.

If that is the case.

The God Luminas's true identity is actually Demon Lord Valentine.

Learning this fact, I am speechless out of astonishment.

![hard scene break]

Diablo is so joyful to the point of shaking as he puts on an evil smile.

"---I'll permit it. Go banish them."

With this one line from Rimuru, he is now permitted to any violent behaviors.

He really wishes to banish these fools as soon as possible, but before that, there is one other thing to do.

"By the way, everyone, are you all all right?"

Diablo asks the reporters delightfully.

The fireball was intercepted by Diablo's "Barrier", and so no reporter was hurt. That also included the demon slayers and Edward along with his Imperial Knights that entered the "Barrier". Everyone is unharmed.

"Elemental Magic" or "Spirit Magic" requires magicule, and so they are unable to break through Diablo's "Barrier".

"Tsk, abominable demon. I can't believe he possesses such power---"

"What a horrifying guy. But if that's the case, let's demonstrate the holy power as well---"

"Here we go, everyone gets ready!"

The Seven Luminaries thought they could easily get rid of everyone, yet the situation at hand is truly out of their expectation.

No matter how strong the demon is, as soon as its flesh used in its incarnation is destroyed, it will lose its influence on the world. Unable to sustain its demonic body, it will be instantly returned to the spiritual world.

Based on this, the members of the Seven Luminaries came up with the ultimate magic.

A gigantic fireball---Nuclear Strike Magic "Flame of destruction (Nuclear Flame)".

This ultimate elemental magic isn't even possible to be wielded by one person, it requires three people's cooperation to execute. It is the evil flame of hell that will incinerate everything. Yet, with Diablo on the defense, it didn't work at all.

The shocked Seven Luminaries decided to pull out their final solution without hesitation. They can only rely on the Holy Power in order to beat someone as dangerous as Diablo---Based on this consideration, they've decided to utilize their supposedly reserved trump card "Trinity Break".

"It is the same ultimate technique used by the other sages in the fight against Rimuru. It will take some time to prepare, but they can be rest assured as the casting process is protected by "Barrier". Moreover, this skill will unleash "Trinity Disintegration" in the end, a Holy Magic spell that can decimate all beings."

Monster or majin, no matter how strong---Even a Demon Lord, should not be able to defend against that spell. The Seven Luminaries casted it with such confidence---

"If that's the case---" Diablo thinks to himself and turns to talk to the other people. He has completely ignored the Seven Luminaries and focused his attention on the press.

"Did you all just witness that attack? They are clearly trying to kill you, aren't they?"

He asks gently.

Even Sare who was just fighting him couldn't deny it.

And naturally none of the reporters made a sound to object.

Everyone is aware of what is going on and nod unanimously.

The guardian of mankind, the great heroes---Some of the reporters know these people, they are the legendary "Seven Luminary Clerics".

The reporters have all realized that there were no lies in Diablo's words and that they were all supposed to be sacrificed. The Seven Luminaries planned to eliminate them along with Diablo in order to then claim to the public that it is all Diablo's doing.

"But, you may all be rest assured. For I will protect you."

In the reporters' eyes, Diablo is giving off a kind and gentle smile like Buddha.

They are confident in Diablo's promise. He was strong enough to take on "Three Martial Sage" Sare with ease, then he definitely can defeat the legendary "Seven Luminary Clerics".

"W-what should we give in return---"

"Money?"

Some people are questioning Diablo's intent.

Since demons never do things for free, they will always seek payment.

And it should be the same for Diablo. He wouldn't lend his aid for free except for Rimuru.

"Kufufufufu, how wonderful it is that you are all so reasonable. I only wish for one thing---"

He raises his demand with a smile.

He demanded that reporters would prove his innocence.

Hearing this, the reporters are greatly relieved, believing this is a reasonable price.

It wasn't at all like this when they initially learnt that Diablo was a vicious demon, yet it turned out to be not be the case. After the high lieutenant Sare of Holy Empire of Lubelius was affected as well, the reporters realized that it was the highest executives, the Seven Luminaries that were behind this whole ordeal. They don't have a reason to turn down Diablo's demand, for they themselves were manipulated as well.

"Of course! Please allow me to spread the news of this whole thing to the public more!"

"Right, I'll document all of it! Including your incredible skills!"

"No problem. And that's why we'll be relying on you! Please lend us your aid!"

Near a hundred of reporters all agreed to assisting Diablo.

And it means that they are now under the influence of Unique Skill 'Tempter'.

They have signed the contract that forbids them from betraying.

"Kufufufufu, very well. I shall agree to rescuing all of you. All except you."

Diablo points at a certain person while saying so, it is Edward who has just awakened from his coma.

"W-why? What have I do---"

"Silence! You tried to deceive the great Rimuru-sama. And that crime alone cannot simply be repaid with death. Let me be very clear now, you are not worthy of salvation."

Diablo says so arrogantly.

Edward desperately tries to use his knotted brain to think, yet he can't come up with a good idea. He knows but one thing, that he is going to die if this continues.

He turns to his knights, yet they all avert their eyes immediately. It can't be helped really. Their opponents are either the monsters led by a Demon Lord or the legendary heroes, they can't win against either of them.

"I'm begging you, please, truly please, save me... No, please save me^[The second "me" here turned to a more humble way of addressing the pronoun "I". Whereas the first "me" still used the pronoun "朕" which is how an emperor/king would address himself.] as well!"

All Edward can do is to beg with a desperate expression. But it is not able to move Diablo's heart.

"Kufufufufu, then you can bring the regret for your stupidity to the next world."

Neither the reporters nor anyone else are planning to help Edward.

They can't possibly do such a thing. No one wants to be the mediator when it was Edward who orchestrated this whole thing in the first place. It is only karma for such thing to backfire on himself.

Noticing that no one has the intention to help, Edward begins to cry out loud.

"I'll give you everything. Money or power. I-I'll even give you the throne. I'll step down to give you everything---"

Hearing this, Diablo begins to ponder a bit.

"Right, the Hero Youm was responsible for looking after Edmalis-dono. I believe that man is qualified enough to lead your nation of the Kingdom of Farmus. What do you think?"

Diablo's tone becomes slightly gentler as he asks Edward this.

He quickly catches on the meaning. With Edward's brain running at the fastest speed in his life, he understands everything said to him clearly.

"I-I think so too! He is a man of talent. I shall announce to the public that he has been appointed as my successor---"

Edward's answer seems to satisfy Diablo a lot.

The reporters also sense his intent.

"Hahahaha. A new Hero King is about to be born???"

"We must spread and promote this news wide around the world---"

They are all very practical as to catch on to what Diablo meant and agree with their words.

Diablo nods joyfully.

Now everything is properly arranged. Although the plan has slightly deviated, the result nonetheless seems satisfying.

Now he will only have to take care of the trash---

The moment then arrives.

"Huh, have you made your resolve?"

"For not much longer shall our beam of evil cleansing shall be sent on your way."

"Enjoy while your numbered life lasts---"

The Seven Luminaries seem to be quite confident with their spell as they sit around observing the situation energetically. Yet they are all about to fall in despair.

"Resolve? Quit joking around, you trash. Hindering my mission and embarrassing me in front of Rimuru-sama---That crime is too severe. I shall repay you with the fear and despair that I have felt in folds---"

Diablo stares at the Seven Luminaries without a smile. His face is of no emotion while the handsome look of his only deepen people's fear.

"W-what---?"

"What nonsense are you on about?"

"Are you mad? With our spell---"

At that instant, the sound of Diablo's snap of his fingers interrupts the words of Seven Luminaries.

Then, the whole world is doomed with fear.

"May the world be destroyed slowly so you will have a taste of helpless despair! Activate--- "Despair Time" ---"

This is Diablo's power.

It is one of the abilities under his Unique Skill 'Tempter' --- "World of Temptation". It originally would have a direct impact on the targets' consciousness and affect their psyche. Yet Diablo has made this ability even more powerful.

He is able to materialize the imaginary world where he holds the absolute authority. Once sent to that world, even the life and death of the targets would be in Diablo's grip. He may even intertwine the things happening in his imaginary world with what happens in the real world through "Reality Exchange" ^[This skill "虚実変換" refers to "exchanging what is real and what is imaginary".].

To have the illusion imposed by Diablo materialize to their realities---This is how horrifying and beyond common sense this ability is. The only way to overcome its effect is through training of the spiritual body so one can break through by sheer willpower.

Yet there are very few people who can best Diablo who was a spiritual life form to begin with, the "Seven Luminary Clerics" are no exception.

"W-what is this!"

"Magic, our magic disappeared---!"

"How can this be..."

They shout in astonishment, yet amounting to no change.

They can only allow time to pass as they remain in despair.

In the end, their world begins to collapse.

"Reflect on your stupidity at the depths of hell---"

With this said, Diablo wraps up the final act.

"Collapsing World (End of World)" ---As "World of Temptation" collapses, it will suck in those affected by it.

The world comes to an end, devouring the despair of the Seven Luminaries along with it.

---Soon after, the promise made at this place will be successfully carried out.

![hard scene break]

Demon Lord Valentine---No, Luminas's presence here alone is shocking enough, yet someone else emerged from the gate. I recall this man seemed to be Demon Lord Valentine (fake), now that I think about it, he must have been Luminas's body double this whole time.

The three members of the Seven Luminaries become pale as they remain on their knees in front of Luminas. It seems that they've become fearful like lambs to be slaughtered and aren't planning to fight us any longer.

Then, what would Luminas do?

She said that she was sorry for the trouble, which would mean that they have no intention to fight us...

Just as I thought so, the man who acted as body double opens up:

"Kneel at this instant. I am Pope Louis. And this lord here is our God---Luminas-sama!"

He announces sonorously.

Hearing this, the Holy Knights all quickly kneel down. It is almost as if they've suddenly met a certain famous retired vice-shogun (Mito Komon)^[Lieutenant-general or more accurately, Vice-Shogun. Mito Komon (水戸黄門) or Tokugawa Mitsukuni (徳川光圀) was a prominent feudal lord during Edo period of Japanese history who served his cousin Tokugawa Iemitsu, who is likely the most famous Shogun of Feudal Japan. The usage here is just a metaphor as to how respectful the Holy Knights are to Luminas's presence.], but I should keep such a thought to myself.

Although feeling confused, we still decide to observe quietly on the side.

But...the Demon Lord is the God, what kind of joke is this?

And the Demon Lord's double is the pope? Goodness me, this type of disguise is so out of this world that I'm having trouble digesting.

But considering it carefully, it must be a very efficient way---

<<Affirmative. Speculate to be able to create effective circumstance for this species' domination over "Human". >>

Ah, hmm.

Does it mean that I should copy it as well? But don't get me wrong.

If I don't clarify that, Wisdom King Raphael may go out of control (to try imitating). Anyhow, I'll put that thought aside for now.

"---Hinata. Didn't I tell you to not overdo things for yourself? How dare you be so reckless."

As she speaks, Luminas reach her hand out to Hinata hugged by me.

"Let the heart be alive once more! Resurrection!"

This is the Holy Miracle "Resurrection" ---

In front of my eyes, the wound that pierced through Hinata's back to her left chest begin to heal.

It seems to be more effective than my healing potion, but hold on for a second.

How can a Demon Lord cast Holy Miracle?

<<Answer. Holy Miracle refers to a type of magic that effectively utilizes spiritrons. Normal means cannot interfere with spiritrons, however, said method has been identified. Remaining task is analysis--->>

Although I still don't get it, Wisdom King Raphael-san seems to be eager to try.

I should be reassured with whatever that is handed to Raphael-san, so I'll leave things as they are.

"Uh, uh---Hmm...s-sensei---?"

Oh, Hinata seems to have regained consciousness.

Is she mistaking me for Shizue-san?

"Oh, you're finally awake. What teacher? You were trying to cross the border, right---"

Since it's quite intriguing, I decide to joke around a bit with her.

Without her usual tough appearance, Hinata looks very innocent.

I recall she came here during her high school years, and it has been around a decade or so? Meaning her age is around---

Just as I thought so, Hinata's eyes suddenly become sharp.

She is looking at me with a cruel expression.

"---Oi."

"Yes milady."

"Were you thinking about something rude?"

"No, no way."

"Is that so? I suppose I'll let it slide. By the way, how much longer do you plan to hug me?"

What hugging, how rude. I made an effort to take care of you only to be met with such rude words.

Although I wish to complain, for some reason, the atmosphere has prevented me from speaking. I should just apologize now nicely. You are getting a favor by suffering a loss, that is the mature way of considering life.

"Sorry! Thanks for the view though!"

I immediately jump away from Hinata after saying so.

Hearing my words, Hinata turn to look at her chest.

There is a hole on her clothes that display her tender white bosoms.

"---Oh?"

Shit, Hinata's murderous aura is abnormally high.

Did I accidentally trip the landmine?

"Has no one ever called you a blockhead?"

"N-no you, quit staring at me *with those sharp looks*. You are so stubborn and never listen to others' words!"

I couldn't help but retort, which turns out to be a big mistake.

A sense of anger suddenly emerges on Hinata's beautiful face as she smacks her mouth. However, Hinata takes in a deep breath and suppresses this anger to then turn to me with a smile.

This is way scarier...

"...Look. I'm just shortsighted sometimes, that's all. Do you see now how much of a blockhead you are? With that sort of behavior, I bet you've never been popular with girls in the past."

Hinata's words stabbed right through my heart and caused fatal damage.

Annoying! She's reminding of my long-forgotten past.

"T-there is no such thing! I was very caring and reliable in the past!"

"Oh---All right then."

Hinata looks at me with a sympathetic expression and gives a disdainful chuckle.

Unwillingly, I have lost.

Why do I feel such sense of defeat when I was supposed to be the victor of the fight.

Speaking of which, I haven't even declared my victory...

Leaving me destroyed with the above sayings, Hinata goes on to treat Renard with healing magic.

She's an expert in that field as well.

She probably thought that if anything urgent had happened, there is no way that Luminas would not lend an aiding hand, so she simply ignored everything else. It seems like that Luminas is the type who will ignore people if they are not to her interest.

Renard, good luck. You are an even sadder fellow than me.

Seeing that Luminas has healed Hinata, the Holy Knights seem to have erased their doubts for her as well. After all, there is no reason to question it when some of them seem to know Pope Louis as well.

When Renard regains consciousness, everyone begins to share this joy.

They begin to surrender to Hinata with tears while shouting her name. "Hinata-sama!"

Ah, someone got punched for staring at her chest.

As expected of Hinata, how terrifying.

Does it matter that she is short-sighted? She seems to have "Magic Perception" on for most of the times.

Ah, the chance of exposure for man peeking at the ladies is almost one hundred percent. I have to be careful.

Even though it is too late to say so.

As such, everyone regains their calmness before Luminas opens up with majesty:

"---Then, Seven Luminaries, what excuse do you have for this incident?"

Everyone is curious of how Luminas would tie up the loose ends, and so we remain to watch it unfold.

It is then that Diablo reports back to me.

"---Rimuru-sama, it is done."

"Good. Then, how did things go?"

"Kufufufufu. All according to the original plan---"

This Diablo seems to be in a pretty good mood.

It must mean that all the problems have been resolved.

"All right, report back to me after the whole things settle for a while."

"Understood. I look forward to when that chance arises."

As he finishes, Diablo withdraws from "Telepathy Net" and goes back to his mission.

It probably means that he was also able to get rid of the false accusation and clear his name for the murdering charge.

If that's the case, I won't interfere with how the Seven Luminaries are trialed.

It is true that I got a lot of trouble for this, but I've accepted Luminas's apology just now. Further interference would only make things more troublesome. We should focus on how to improve our relationship in the future instead.

As I was thinking this, the result of the trial seems to be out.

It is quick and ruthless.

"The punishment is death. As a parting gift, I shall send you on your way myself---"

"H-have mercy!"

"We only did these for Luminas-sama---"

"Please, f-for all the years we've pledged our loyalty, we beg you---"

The Seven Luminaries are begging for Luminas's forgiveness desperately. However, their wish did not come true.

"---I gift thou the blessing of the dead (Death Blessing)!"

Luminas opened her arms as the invisible hands of god gently surround the members of the Seven Luminaries.

It is a hug of compassion and love---or so it appears, but it seems to be a cruel skill that transform its target from life to death. It is sufficient to see how immense just part of Demon Lord Luminas's power is.

The Seven Luminaries that attempted to frame and sabotage us came to their painless demise in an instant.

What a waste of all my mental preparation for possibly going to war with Holy Empire of Lubelius now that things are so casually resolved.

And so, we change our venue to a location more suited for negotiation to discuss the future of our relation.

![soft scene break]

Since it's not good to negotiate while standing, we decided to switch a venue.

I returned triumphantly alongside Luminas, Louis, Hinata and the rest to the town.

Then, I suddenly recall something as I am welcomed by Veldora.

"Ah, sorry. The final defense didn't have a chance to show up."

"What! And I had my hopes high while waiting here..."

Veldora seems to have some complaints, but I can only ask him to accept it.

All in all, things are resolved smoothly---or so I thought. But there is no such good deal in the world.

As soon as he lays his eyes on Luminas, Veldora suddenly drops the shocking statement:

"...! Oh oh, you are that someone! Finally, now I remember! Luminas, aren't you Demon Lord Luminas! You are the female vampire who was at that castle I trashed. Haha, now I finally remember. Feels good, feels---"

Veldora dared to expose such information. Luminas then suddenly creates a sword to plunge at him in order to shut him up.

But it is already too late.

The truth that the God Luminas is Demon Lord Luminas Valentine has been completely revealed.

The Holy Knights are all silent.

They must all be very confused about what they just heard.

Hinata seems to be aware of the fact and begins to sigh with her palm on the face. Louis on the other hand has decided to stay away from the whole thing.

I can't stand it.

I have a new understanding of how much of a troublemaker Veldora is.

And then---

Luminas cusses out loud: "This fucking lizard is back at it again to ruin my business---" She becomes out of control due to fury and everyone begins desperately trying to calm her down.

But---

That is a story for another day.
