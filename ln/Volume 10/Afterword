# Afterword

Long time no see, everyone. This is Fuse.

I was going to forgo writing an afterword this time. The reason being that this volume has been the one with the most added pages in the history of Tensura light novels, even after attempts at cutting things.

The sound of Editor I-san giving up the struggle was really unforgettable.

But! It turned out, in the end, there were a couple pages left. They told me to write an afterword of around five pages.

I mentioned this before, when I go to a bookshop to read light novels, I would first read the blurb before checking the afterword. Sometimes I will even determine whether the work is interesting or not on the merits of the afterword.

Moreover, even if the work is part of a big series, I'll still read the afterword to first check whether there is any new information, when the next volume will be released, etc. That's my habit of checking before reading the actual book.

That's why personally I felt that "the afterword is important," but when it came to my time to write one, it was a different story...

No, actually, I suppose even if I were to write about the author's personal life, not a lot of people would be interested. And if I discussed something related to the series, it would become a spoiler. As opposed to writing an afterword, it's probably better to write more in the main story. That's probably what a lot of people's thoughts are right now.

If the readers want to hear about things like this in particular, please contact the GC Novels editorial department!

It will probably be reflected in the book.

Now, let's have a little chat about this time's volume.

Regarding the pistol that was introduced in this volume, there's an untold story behind it.

This is the first time I used Arabic numerals. That was the pistol name that actually exists in real life, "Walther P99." We were going to use kanji for the numbers, but it seems that weapons from the real world are an exception to that.

The weapon that Glenda used in the novel was a semi-automatic pistol developed by the German weapon manufacturer Walther. And of course, it is real.

At first, I was considering whether I should use a pistol produced by Beretta, such as the M92 or PX4, but if I did, it may get mixed up with the character Beretta. That's why I got pretty frustrated trying to decide which gun to choose, before finally settling on the P99.

Speaking of Walther, their P38 is quite famous. The highly popular master thief (Lupin III)^[Lupin the Third is a Japanese manga series.] also uses this weapon, so it's very well known. I initially wanted to get some of his clout but decided not to in the end.

Glenda-san is a female, so a smaller and more compact weapon is probably more suited for her. Based on this consideration, I settled on the gun that was introduced this time, the "Walther P99."

Its name only appeared once, but in order to write about it, I researched a bunch and even bought an airsoft version of it. It was then that I recalled I wanted one when I was a kid. I suppose this can be considered as me fulfilling a childhood dream, now that I have the money as an adult---uh, but I digress.

That's the type of gun it was. I plan to make it show up a couple of times in the future as well.

There are mechanical and magic type pistols. While the pistols in question have the same names, the two are very different from each other. For instance, the gun Rimuru brought to the exploration was only a recreated copy. It only looked similar in appearance. It also seemed to require gunpowder, but I felt that there was too much complication. Can't we make it a bit simpler? That's why I gave the final pistol some magic modification.

Furthermore, in the book I hinted at the fact that the Empire had guns as well. So, I plan to write something completely different for them. I only made the magic-modified guns with reference to the way that Rimuru and the others thought.

That's how I felt. But there are also other problems.

On the demon side, I planned that for the same clan, they will be named after supercars. On the other hand, the series of magic dolls, like Beretta, would be named after gun manufacturers.

In the web novel, Beretta didn't have any brothers.

So, what should we do?

The reason why we mentioned naming Walther was in hope that Rimuru would recall the matter...

Sig, Colt, Glock, Mauser, Mateba, Remington. There are also the twins, Heckler and Koch. There are also tons of other candidates, but these are the only ones that made it in. These people, as Beretta's peers, will surely shine in Tempest.

*Figuring out their backstories alone would be tiring, so please don't let them be introduced*---I could almost hear someone's cry along this line, so there's probably no need to introduce them. However, I hope that, in the future, they can be introduced in side stories and other Tensura IP.

And these are the untold stories about guns.

Here at the end of the volume, I want to express my gratitude to everyone that I've accumulated from my daily life.

First of all, I want to thank Editor I-san who was always helpful with providing information to me. With the increase in pages, I apologize for the extra work. But since you said that it was good for the readers, as the author, I was therefore relieved. My mood really improves whenever I'm talking to you over the phone, so I'll be counting on you in the future as well!

There's also Mitz Vah-sensei who has provided the series with beautiful illustrations every time. Thank you for your hard work on designing Mariabell. Thanks to you, the character was created excellently. As I am writing this afterword, you must be working hard on Volume 10's cover and illustration.

Even as the author, I am also looking forward to it!

The series only got to be published with the support of the proofreaders, designers, and other people.

Thank you all so much!

I would also like to thank all the readers. "That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime" managed to make it through the tenth volume at last. Thanks to all the readers for following the series to this day. To repay everyone's support, I will work harder in the future with the goal of concluding the series one day.

Please continue to support "That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"!
