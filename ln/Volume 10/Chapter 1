# Chapter 1: The Smooth|Operation of|the Labyrinth

The Founding Festival of the Tempest Federation was a success, and with that the festival came to an end. It had been a busy ten days, and all the invited guests as well as visitors from the neighboring nations had all left the town.

That included the king of Blumund and Fuze, who both seemed to have something to discuss regarding their future plans and went home as soon as they could.

Dwarven King Gazel promised to elect a squad of researchers and also left pretty early.

As for the Emperor of Sarion, Elmesia, she bought some sort of inn near the guest hotel located in the prime district of town. She picked one of the rooms in it and set up a magic portal, apparently for the convenience of coming back for fun at any time.

As expected from a billionaire. She really was lavish with her spending. I still remember the superiority-laden smile Elmesia gave the clearly jealous Gazel---chances are he'll march right back to Dwargon and have their treasury authorize the cash to purchase one of our villas.

Maybe I should be thanking Elmesia. Even better, she agreed to continue employing our local people working there, under the same conditions. Rigurd took care of the detailed arrangements involving chores such as providing her food and routinely cleaning her room.

"I guess next time I visit, I'll transfer my consciousness to a homunculus. It's a pity that I can't fully enjoy myself with that body..."

"Your Majesty, please stop being so self-indulgent!"

An example to counter her point this time was the fact that Elmesia herself leaving the nation had already caused Armageddon. Although this had nothing to do with us, Elalude must have been tormented beyond his breaking point. Even the mobilization of the bodyguards to protect Elmesia---the Magus---was considered a serious matter in terms of national defense.

"Is that so... Then is Elen using a homunculus as well...?"

Elen was Elalude's daughter, so she was of course also an elf.

Her ears however, looked human.

"Oh, about that, Elen-chan is using her own body. Homunculi are not all-powerful. In fact, prolonged use of one puts the user at risk."

"YOUR MAJESTY! Your nonchalant attitude leaking national secrets will cause huge problems!"

From my private conversation with Elmesia, Elen seems to have been using drugs to alter her appearance and used her own body to travel. That was why Elalude was always worried and had sent many bodyguards in secret. Speaking of which, to my utter surprise, Kabal and Gido were both members of the Magus. Elalude was just shouting that dispatching even one of these knights would affect national defense, yet he was generous enough to send two by his daughter's side... Elalude sure cared a lot about his daughter.

"But how come those two never looked that strong...?"

When I ran 'Analyze and Assess' on the two in the past, they appeared to be quite weak. Therefore, I asked to clarify my doubts. Elalude, on the other hand, answered with quite a bit of restraint, "That's top secret as well, but I'll let you in on it. Those two have equipped magic rings that limit their abilities. If Elen really were to fall into danger, the limit would then be removed."

*That's what he said, so does that mean that Sarion's Sorcerer Technology is superior to my 'Analyze and Assess'?---*I was quite surprised. But now that I thought about it, the accuracy of my 'Analyze and Assess' back then was vastly inferior to what I have now. Perhaps today I'd be able to see through their hidden strength. It seemed that I couldn't let my guard down just because I had run an examination or two on a person. *I really need to be more cautious from now on. Next time I meet the two, I'll secretly run an 'Analyze and Assess' on them.*

"Then, please take care of my daughter."

"Well then, till next time!"

With that said, Elmesia's party went aboard their kingdom's Guardian Dragon King Ship to return to their nation.

![break]

Demon Lord Luminas on the other hand was very casual with her travel methods since she could use her immense power to cast 'Spatial Movement' and return to her kingdom almost instantly. As for the orchestra exchange, she told me she'd contact me about the matter in the future.

Hinata remained in town. She checked on the kids' classes at the Church and occasionally sparred with them. At the time, we couldn't find any suitable teachers for the children. It was at that point that Hinata showed up.

Until then, she had been maintaining the peace of the Western Nations as the commander of the Holy Knight Order. We would collaborate from now on, and since we were handling the peace in the south for now, Hinata also seemed to have gotten some spare time.

"If you don't mind, could you spend some time with the kids?" I asked her. "Although I know how to use magic, I'm not really a great teacher."

"Sure. I've already used Elemental Magic 'Waypoint Teleportation' to register the town. I'll drop by to take care of the kids when I'm free."

Hinata accepted my request without hesitation; she really came in clutch this time.

After all, I had no intention of letting the children return to Ingracia in the first place. Due to my suspicion towards Yuuki, it was better to not leave them in the care of the Kingdom of Ingracia. That's why I brought them out using the festival as an excuse...

I didn't forget to register their transfer. In any case, instructing the children became more and more of a challenge for the schools of Ingracia. After "Merging" them with spirits, they had obtained incredible power. Any average tutor wouldn't have been able to handle them. So right now, I had to find someone who could properly instruct them.

Yuuki told me that the Holy Knights were the most capable of commanding spirits. I had mentioned spirits by accident back then during our conversation. And according to Yuuki's reaction at the time, he seemed to have known about it from the start.

*I should probably have kept it a secret*---

<<Report. You should have kept it a secret indeed.>>

*R-right.* Even Raphael-san seemed to be rubbing the salt in the wound.

No no no, even if I hadn't said anything, he probably would have found out anyway.

*We're just overthinking it, so let's not worry about it too much.*

<<...>>

*Umm, sorry.*

I still spilled the beans despite my suspicions towards Yuuki. I realized that in some corner of my heart, I still wanted to believe in him. I'll have to reflect on this slip-up and be more cautious in the future.

The children were now my responsibility. And given these circumstances, Hinata's help was a godsend. The children also grew very close to Hinata through their time spent together during the festival. She was the perfect candidate.

*Speaking of having Hinata as a teacher, maybe I should also be a student and learn some things from her.*

After I settled on the idea, I stood alongside the kids behind the row of desks. Yet Hinata glared at me.

"What are you trying to do here?"

"Eh, well, I wanted to observe for a bit..."

"You're a nuisance, so get out now."

"Ah, yes ma'am..."

And so I was chased out cruelly. What a pity.

![break]

This was what happened around a week after the end of the festival. The traffic on the streets had gradually settled down and the residents were no longer that busy. And so, we began to open and run the moderated dungeon. Quite a few adventurers seemed eager to explore the dungeon and a great number of them had inquired about it. And, as if in response to their expectations, we finally opened up the labyrinth. We had already made sufficient preparations and waited until just the right moment to open.

The days gradually became busy.

.........

......

...

Problems emerged within hours of the debut. The issue at hand was the unexpectedly reckless and stupid way challengers went about exploring the dungeon.

We expected this to happen for the first demonstration during the opening festival. That's why we took steps to lower the difficulty accordingly. But despite all that, the challengers were still having too much of a hard time. It would appear that what we set up was just not gonna work.

We didn't put any traps on the first floor, and the monsters that spawned there were at most F-ranked mobs. Being incapable of combat, these were monsters even a villager could easily handle.

The intent behind the design of this floor was to provide challengers with a sense of pride and accomplishment and familiarize everyone with the environment inside, which was why we only placed monsters in the rooms that contained treasure chests. That said, the previous fall traps that Ramiris set were all removed. So, in order to successfully break through the floor, you would still need to sketch maps.

The way I saw it, no matter how slow you were, a whole day was the longest you would need to complete the floor.

Yet for the past three days, not a single one managed to get to the second floor. Even that squad Basson led got lost big time and just gave up. Even though Basson's squad already had experience with the labyrinth, they still didn't plan out any noteworthy strategy.

*Should I say that I'm dumbfounded or what...*

But I guess you could say Basson's squad was doing well, especially considering that some teams even fell victim to rank D monsters.

*Perhaps I should correct myself:* that happened to *a lot* of teams.

Most of them were likely blinded by greed and didn't discover the monsters lurking in the room's corners. Plenty of idiots like that went straight for the treasure chest instead. They were probably caught by surprise by mere skeleton archers. As these comically bad adventurers rushed towards the treasure chests, their backs were inevitably pierced with arrows.

In other words, they just sucked. Their danger awareness was practically nonexistent. Among the idiots, some were at least smart enough to come in squads. Yet there were really no limits on human stupidity, since some of them actually tried to challenge our labyrinth on their own. That kind of behavior bordered on insanity.

![break]

As I've mentioned, the spawn rate of monsters on the first floor was really low, and even if any were to spawn at all, they were rank F at best. That said, when appearing in a group, monsters like those could still pose a threat. Actually, whether it indeed "posed a threat" was subject to debate. Rather, I should say that it posed sufficient threat to the challengers.

If you were to come in alone, even resting would prove challenging. With no one on guard, you couldn't even take a nap. No matter how weak rank F monsters were, they were still capable of hurting you. Certain types of monsters would launch a sneak attack on sleeping humans, and if you weren't cautious enough, you could easily wind up dead.

I initially thought that these solo challengers had some great strategies in mind, but it turned out that they were just a bunch of brainlets. These reckless idiots didn't get anywhere and immediately left upon exiting the labyrinth. But, to be honest, based on how they had acted, they wouldn't have lasted any longer even if they had managed to somehow make it further down.

From Floor 2 onward, not only were there more monsters in the hallways, but rank E opponents would also start spawning among them. When challengers made it to Floor 5, they would begin to face rank D monsters as well. If you had trouble merely getting through these earlier floors, you would definitely be killed when encountering rank D monsters.

One of the challengers had a particularly embarrassing reason for forfeiting---he was starving.

On every tenth floor we had set a save point, and on every fifth floor we had a safe zone prepared where water could be refilled. We also subtly reminded everyone to bring more rations.

The other adventurers seemed to have made plans after analyzing Basson's squad's experience. But that alone wasn't enough. Adventurers seemed to be a very prideful bunch and they often ignored others' advice. Not sure whether it was the fact that they couldn't die in the labyrinth, or that they were overconfident in their abilities. Either way, many of them didn't bring any rations.

If you got so lost that you were unable to find your way back to the entrance, then starvation came as no surprise.

No matter how I thought about it, it was their own fault.

They wanted to open as many treasure chests as possible---*although I suppose I remember how that feels...*

If our labyrinth were truly designed with the intention to kill, I doubt there'd be anyone who could crack it even after a hundred years. But at this time, the challengers were either impoverished bodyguards or mercenaries, all of whom sucked at exploration.

![break]

*We don't have to panic just yet*---with that thought, I held my expectations for the next three days.

Yet, in the end, not a single one managed to reach the safe zone on the fifth floor. The attempts had been miserable.

.........

......

...

That being said, we did profit off of the entry fees, which was always a plus. But if this were to continue, the adventurers would all have low morale, and chances of challengers returning would be minimal.

It looked like we needed to re-examine the whole project.

This unexpected matter had caused me grave concern.

![soft scene break]

This being the case, I called an emergency meeting.

The people attending were me, Veldora, Ramiris, and the observer, Masayuki. I also summoned Myourmiles who ran the project. After confirming everyone's arrival, I lead the opening statement: "Everyone, it has been three days since the labyrinth went public, but this is not looking good. To be blunt, it actually sucks. For our entertainment---no, in order to have anyone want to return to our labyrinth---I think it would be best to provide them with a level of guidance."

First of all, people would have problems reaching the tenth floor if we were to continue like this. If that were to be the case, our labyrinth would probably have to be put on hold as a result. That's why I came to the conclusion that we had to at least educate them about strategy to some degree.

"Umm! Rimuru is right. If we allow this to continue, there won't be a chance for me to shine no matter how much longer I wait."

"Seriously! Floors 50 and below are my proud work. I really want the world to see them. I think we can give them some hints!"

And so, I got Veldora and Ramiris's approval. Masayuki seemed to be pondering something---actually, he seemed confused. He didn't know why he was here and seemed to feel out of place. After all, he got summoned so abruptly. Anyhow, it looked like Masayuki probably needed a while to regain his cool, after which I would ask for his opinion.

I shifted my gaze away from Masayuki and over to Myourmiles. Getting to see Masayuki, who he admired greatly, had left him beaming with joy. It was probably the reason why he was particularly well-prepared to speak on the matter.

"May I have a word about it?"

"Any suggestion is welcome. Speak your mind; there's no need to hold back."

Hearing this, Myourmiles nodded.

"Regarding the matter of giving hints, I hope you can be reserved about the number. It's only been three days and whatever adventurers we had so far, each one of them had subpar skill. I have already made contact with some seasoned adventurers through the Freedom Association; therefore, I believe that there, surely, will be more adventurers of rank C or higher with greater abilities in the future."

"Is it going to work?"

"Yes. Although I can't grasp what's on Yuuki-san's mind, he did carry out his end of our deal. He contacted all the divisions of the Freedom Association throughout the land via 'Magic Communication' in order to promote us."

"I see, so there's some benefit to hosting one of their branches here after all. Anything else?"

"Yes. I've asked for favors from the merchants to assist in advertising. The experienced bodyguards and street mobs that were acquainted with them also joined the cause. Their report seemed to indicate very good feedback from the public."

![break]

Both the delivery and collection of information were important.

I then introduced Souka to Myourmiles and told her to assist him in his work.

Souka was the leader of 'Dark Shadows'^[Ruby text: Kurasemi (Blue Dark Crowd)], and she also hosted the festival events with Myourmiles. It seemed that Myourmiles was good at dealing with people, and so the two immediately got along. I was glad that there was no prejudice involved.

And with that, several of Souka's subordinates began operating under Myourmiles's command.

As a matter of fact, even Souei helped him out with things. Souei was currently investigating Duke Muze's activity. I indirectly ordered him to also promote our nation during his mission.

As a result, word of the dungeon even managed to reach some distant villages that weren't home to a division of the Freedom Association.

![break]

"In other words, we will wait for elites to gather from all across the land, and then make a decision?"

"Indeed. This project has just gone public," Myourmiles said enthusiastically. "We have no need to rush in order to see any results just yet. I believe that we should calm down now and set our eyes on the future! Moreover, if the noblemen invest in the conquest, we can expect to see adventurers with rank B and above."

Seeing Masayuki nodding in admiration, Myourmiles seemed to be pleased. Looks like he was eager to show off his abilities in front of Masayuki.

What he said made sense as well. It was all because of how much Veldora and Ramiris complained that I too got nervous all of a sudden.

Basson's entire squad combined could be considered as rank B. With their current equipment, their individual abilities were around C to C-plus, far from outstanding. If the conquest were handled by someone above rank B, surely, they would familiarize themselves with the labyrinth without requiring many hints.

In our labyrinth, you could pay to have your personal safety ensured. Even if we left them to their own devices, these experienced adventurers would be able to devise their own strategies.

"That's right; there's no use for us to rush things."

Public interest in the labyrinth was high. Apart from 'Magic Crystals,' you could also harvest materials from the monsters, and knowing that you could sell these for a pretty penny, there was no end to the number of people who came flocking to the labyrinth.

The nobles were also quick to react. Their willingness to partake in the conquest business was higher than we imagined. Some were quick-witted enough to immediately hire adventurers upon returning to their nation, requesting them to help with the labyrinth conquest. These hired adventurers weren't driven into rash actions by their own desires. They would only operate after proper preparations and setting up plans. Right now, there weren't as many of these types of adventurers, but I expected to see a rise in number in the future.

"Then what should we do?"

"We've set up an armory on the first floor, should we have the challengers try things out over there?"

"Try out? What can they try there?"

Ramiris wasn't the only one who was confused, so I began to explain my idea: "I was thinking about setting up a training ground for people to practice. They can study how to counter traps and how to fight against monsters. Wouldn't that be more meaningful compared to giving them hints?"

We could also build a stadium of sorts along with it. Due to the increasing number of novice recruits to our nation's army, I hoped that this would be beneficial to their training. There wouldn't be any fatal accidents in the labyrinth, so maybe this would provide some very meaningful combat experience.

An unexpected ally came forth to support my idea---it was Masayuki.

"If that were to be the case," he interjected rather casually, "I think it would also be nice to hold lectures about the dungeon conquest."

I looked at Masayuki in surprise.

"Ah, was it bad for me to cut in like that?"

"No no, there's no such thing!"

"Ayy, that's good. The topic you guys were discussing sounded quite interesting. Even I could follow along, so I accidentally cut in," Masayuki said with a wry smile.

He was adapting faster than I imagined, but he did seem kind of bold.

"Then what sort of lecture should we hold?"

*Should we have all the adventurers gather at the big conference room if we were to hold lectures?*

It would be very helpful to explain how the labyrinth worked to them.

"We can imitate tutorials in video games."

"*Tu...torials*? What is that?"

"That sounds tasty, is it food?"

Masayuki's suggestion got Veldora and Ramiris's attention.

And I thought that Veldora would know, but it seemed he actually had no idea about it?

The language in this world could be translated pretty accurately, but when lacking a shared understanding of a subject, it would be hard for two parties to make sense of what the other was saying. Since Veldora had no idea what a tutorial was, Ramiris couldn't have known either.

And so, Masayuki and I began to explain what tutorials were.

"It's like a facility to train their abilities. We can simulate what actually takes place in the labyrinth."

"Rimuru-san is right. I think it is important to experience all possible scenarios before entering the labyrinth. If we can teach everyone the basics in the form of missions, I'm sure that it will be easier even for the adventurers to understand---"

Adventurers probably aren't gonna be fans of lengthy explanations. So, we could only prepare a training ground for people who were serious enough to experience for themselves---this was Masayuki's suggestion.

Therefore, we planned to make it a mission-style tutorial. Before releasing the permits to enter, they would have to undertake some simple missions. In this way, the adventurers hoping to challenge the labyrinth would learn the bare minimum required for exploration.

Veldora and Ramiris seemed to have understood after hearing our explanations.

"That may be great. From my point of view, everything now is too simple to the point of being boring. I hope that you can build a training ground so that these challengers can improve their skills."

"I think so too! If Milim were to catch a glimpse of those past challengers, she would have lashed out and beaten all of them up."

Veldora, Ramiris and Myourmiles all gave the green light.

![break]

"After studying the tutorial, we should let them try out some of the amazing weapons and armors crafted in the Tempest Federation. For those who struggled during their actual expedition, preparing more challenging tutorial missions sounded like it would be a fun idea as well," Myourmiles gave some rather note-worthy suggestions.

I see, issuing a guidebook could be an interesting idea. It could also serve as a little tourism brochure. We could introduce the town to the new-comers and even find some suitable people to write some columns.

A lot of inefficiencies stemmed from the fact that no one really knew much about the labyrinth. For that reason, we decided to at least give them a basic tutorial. If we didn't, I doubt anyone would be able to make it past Floor 50, where the difficulty really ramped up. And for those who wanted to fully experience the labyrinth, it would be good to prepare a more extensive practice course.

Well, the Holy Knights were scheduled to be dispatched for Floor 50 and below, which you could say was the real deal.

It seemed like we couldn't expect a lot from the adventurers for now, so it looked like we'd have to depend on the Holy Knights to be Ramiris and Veldora's playmates.

With that, we decided to open the first floor as a practice field. We also didn't forget to prepare an entrance for the new recruits, separate from the challengers.

"You're right; it would be good to separate them. Okay, I'll make them right away!" Ramiris accepted it willingly.

With everything settled like that, I was about to end the meeting when...

"Ah, wait a moment. Another idea came to mind."

To my surprise, it was Masayuki himself who gave his opinion with sparkling eyes.

"Right now, we only have inns and restaurants in safe zones, don't we? Don't you think it would be a good idea to prepare them on every floor as well? And you see, not having places like restrooms too can be tough. If we're connecting the spaces anyway, we should set up doors near the stairs of each floor. Since there are people who set out for battle without even a sleeping bag, don't you think it would be nice to provide them with a sleeping space for a premium price?"

![full page image](image1)

*What? This guy...could he be some sort of a genius?!*

*Hmm, a restroom, huh. Maybe it's because I no longer have bodily functions. I completely forgot to consider that.*

I was quite surprised by his insight.

I turned to Ramiris. She signaled her agreement with a vigorous nod.

"Masayuki-kun, we will employ that idea right away!"

"As expected of Masayuki-sama. Your insights are brilliant!"

"Yeah yeah! I'll remove the safe zones and put up doors by the stairs connecting to the rest area instead!"

Doing this was comparable to offering toilet paper at an exorbitant price next to restrooms that, *incidentally*, didn't have any.

It was a dirty, but nonetheless effective tactic.

It seemed that Masayuki was actually quite sharp.

"If you have any other ideas, please don't be shy. Feel free to speak up," I urged him with a smile.

Then, as if he were remembering the games he played, he immersed himself deep in thought.

"Ummm, let me see... Is it possible to make single-use save points? I was lucky enough to get to the tenth floor, but now without the pitfalls I think it would take quite a bit of time. For the challengers, this isn't just a game, and I think the total amount of time they need to spend is one of the things that makes the labyrinth especially hard."

*Hmm, I see. Surely, what Masayuki said has some truth.*

With the way the labyrinth was currently set up, it would take challengers several days just to get to the tenth floor. Hearing the idea just now, I realized that all the time spent in the labyrinth created a wealth of business opportunities. How about we go one step further and give this more thought?

"Mmm, what that boy there is saying is right! Humans are fragile, so we have to give this more consideration."

Veldora was the first to approve Masayuki's suggestion.

And just *who* was the one that gleefully made this labyrinth of horrors targeted towards "fragile" humans?

"If they're disposable save points, then I can prepare them with my power, y'know? But wouldn't it be more profitable to make an inn for them to stay at?"

The single use savepoints could, in fact, be made. And Ramiris, for some reason, was surprisingly sharp whenever money was involved.

"Not at all, Ramiris-sama. Rather, this is precisely why we should charge a high price for it. Adventurers that don't have any pressing matters will choose to stay at an inn. However, there are probably people who are required to report back regularly. There are also people who would prefer to have at least one just in case anything unexpected happens while they're in the labyrinth. With that in mind, our sales will surely increase along with the 'Return Whistle.'"

Seemed like Myourmiles saw an opportunity for success and wanted to exploit it. Hearing that, I definitely *could* think of various use cases.

If you ended up spending several days in the labyrinth, there could be times where you would want to know the situation outside. Adventurers employed by nobles were in on the action as well, so they might be obligated to report back every now and then.

Moreover---

"Aren't there strong monsters guarding the save point on the tenth floor? While in our case my party was easily able to defeat them, I think there would be quite a lot of people who would want to use the save point *before* challenging those monsters."

After hearing Masayuki out, I very much agreed with him. Saving before challenging a guardian---that's what every gamer would come to expect.

Memories of challenging the final boss without saving beforehand, dying, and then having hours of work go up in smoke all came flooding back to my mind. Those sad incidents could be forgotten with a laugh because it was just a game. But I wonder how furious people would be if it were in real life.

"I see. Thinking about it, maybe our difficulty curve was a bit too harsh."

Veldora and Ramiris nodded along as well.

"My boy, no, did you say your name was Masayuki? I think your views will be very helpful moving forward."

"Yup, Yup. Incredible, incredible. As expected of an otherworlder like Rimuru. I hope you'll keep pitching in, Masayuki!"

And in no time, they seemed to have accepted Masayuki as a colleague.

And Masayuki, as well.

"Below the fiftieth floor, where the going gets tough, I think it would be all right to remove those conveniences. But at least for the upper floors, where there are few skilled adventurers, it wouldn't hurt to hold their hands a little."

He was firing off suggestions on operations management left and right. I wondered if this high adaptability was Masayuki's true character. Well, I didn't have any objections either.

"Okay, then should we prepare a resting room beside each stairwell? And if they pay, let's make it so they could go to an area on the ninety-fifth floor."

"Are you saying we'll prepare an inn and a restaurant there?"

"Of course. I don't plan on opening the exclusive elven shops (cabaret) for adventurers. We'll provide separate accommodations for those guys. Naturally, it'll be pricier!"

"Fufufu, I understand."

Tourist spots were pricier. If you went to places like the summit of Mount Fuji, something as simple as a coffee could be many times more expensive. The barbequed beef there was unparalleled, but regardless of the taste, it was quite pricey. In the same vein, it was only natural that using the facilities within the labyrinth would be more expensive than using the facilities outside.

With this, the city on the ninety-fifth floor just got a lil' more useful.

"And Ramiris, about the one-use save points, could you really prepare them?"

"Of course! It's trivial for me! You see, there is an orb called the Recording Crystal, and it can be used to make one-use save points."

Ramiris had gone and made something rather handy. It would work anywhere in the labyrinth, but, other than that, it was like a normal save point. If you registered with the Recording Crystal and died, it would be possible to return to the recorded spot.

In case you got out of the labyrinth with a 'Return Whistle,' your return point would be the point that was saved in the Recording Crystal. This applied even if the structure of the labyrinth changed. It wouldn't be the exact same spot, but it'd at least take you to the nearest safe zone.

"Let's sell it at the store for a high price."

"Speaking of which, I think it would be good to hand out a few for promotional use."

"Then I will include them in the treasure chests as a rare drop!"

And with that, everything was smooth sailing.

"GA-HAHAHA, finally some more fun!"

"Although I think it's a bit too early to say, we should be seeing less people give up as a result of these changes."

Veldora and Masayuki were happily taking part in the conversation as well.

And just like this, by tackling the problems together one by one, progress was made, and improvements were proposed.

![soft scene break]

Great, great. Everyone's insight has been helpful.

The first floor was converted into a tutorial-style training ground, which also included an announcement system. We set it up to have missions so that adventurers wouldn't be totally clueless coming in.

Whether they made use of it or not was up to them. Nothing good came out of forcing stuff upon them. Plus, whatever happened would be their own responsibility.

Additionally, we also made it so that you couldn't die on the first floor. There could be adventurers that caused problems, and it would be troublesome if something happened to the employees in charge.

Not only that, I also wanted to use the first floor for people to experiment with dying. We set it to resurrect immediately on the spot so it could also be suitable for a children's playground.

We also prepared a room for more experienced adventurers to practice fighting against different kinds of monsters. We captured some monsters and gave them a collar that allowed them to constantly revive. The adventurers could sharpen their skills here.

Using the extra space, we also made an area dedicated to training our own recruits. From time to time, it would be fun to catch a large number of monsters for large scale collective battles.

![break]

The real dungeon started from the second floor downward.

However, we wouldn't be deploying any lethal traps until the fourth floor. There would only be rank E to F lesser monsters roaming the area. The rooms would only have one rank D monster. The treasure chests in them would contain items such as low healing potions which would be helpful for early labyrinth exploration. High price items such as gear were set to spawn only on the fifth floor and below.

And that pretty much summed up all the adjustments we made to the difficulty.

*With this, the challengers can pick up the pace of their conquest of the dungeon starting tomorrow.*

Everything up until now was like a closed beta for a developing game, so it was no surprise that we weren't ready to open the real thing right away.

...Well, in truth, we already had beta testers.

But our testers were six of Shion's 'Yomigaeri,' which might not have painted an accurate picture. Those guys swept through the first thirty-nine floors without a hitch. Unfortunately, they got annihilated by the fortieth floor's boss, the tempest serpent. Thanks to that, we got the false impression that the difficulty of the labyrinth was just right.

They didn't fall victim to the traps, nor did they struggle against the small fry monsters. I didn't think there would be any problems with the labyrinth difficulty after seeing their performance. Maybe they could even reach the fiftieth floor with a little bit more experience.

*Seems like I needed to be more careful when choosing testers.*

Shion trained them herself and they'd become more exceptional than we could have expected.

*Welp, we can think about all that stuff later.*

"Then, shall we wrap it up here? Are there no other comments or concerns?"

Even if I was fully satisfied, I still had to make sure everyone else was fine with it, too. A lot of suggestions had already been made, so I thought that was gonna be all for today. However, Myourmiles suddenly interjected, "Could I say one more thing?"

"Eh? Is there something else?"

"There is. It's about the management of the labyrinth."

*Ahh, is this about the labyrinth's advertisement and fee collection?*

I definitely was concerned about that part as well. It had only been three days, so the profits probably weren't that noticeable, but...

It seemed like Ramiris also smelled the money. She stared right at Myourmiles with an avaricious glint in her eyes. She was such a vulgar fairy that it made me laugh.

"Haha, even if you look at me like that, the fund collection has only just started. The report I will give is related to the advertisement."

Myourmiles smiled bitterly as if he were giving an excuse to Ramiris. Myourmiles then hardened his expression and began the explanation.

"I've already come up with an idea of monetary reward to attract the attention of the nobles. How about one hundred gold coins?"

*Ho ho?*

"That would only be natural---"

"Of course," Myourmiles interjected, "the payment will instead be in the form of one stellar gold coin. At least, that's my plan."

Myourmiles had already read my intentions and was planning accordingly.

I learned one thing from my mistake before. He thought of converting the stellars to just regular gold coins for the sake of liquidity. As far as I knew, even just one hundred gold coins should be nearly ten million Japanese yen.

"But isn't that too low?"

It might've been a lot of money for an average joe, but it was hardly enough to convince a noble. Of course, the labyrinth had more to offer than one hundred gold coins. Rare drops from treasure chests, magic crystal, etc. but I didn't think we should be relying on those alone.

Myourmiles answered my doubts with a reassuring smile.

"Huhuhu, those doubts are natural. I will advertise that this reward will go to those who beat the fiftieth floor. Only the first set of teams every month can claim this prize. If it's just one person, then he or she will get everything. If they have a party, then the reward will be split. However, there's more to it---"

According to Myourmiles's explanation, each boss monster would drop a reward when subjugated. The tenth floor's guardian was a rank B black spider. If you subjugated this one, then the first five teams would get a reward of three gold coins.

On the twentieth floor was the rank B-plus evil centipede. It was a fairly strong monster that could spew a long-range and potent 'paralyzing breath.' If you subjugated this, the first five teams would get a reward of five gold coins.

We placed a rank B-plus ogre lord and his five subordinates on the thirtieth floor. They differed from Benimaru and his clan in the sense that they were brutal monsters that acted only on instinct. They possessed tremendous strength and were capable of coordination. Since you would be battling against a group of monsters, fighting them would be difficult without a team. The reward for beating them was ten gold coins. The same first five team policy applied as well.

And from here on out it genuinely became difficult.

The fortieth floor had the tempest serpent which was rank A-minus. This guy had a lethal ranged attack called 'Poison Breath' that was capable of instantly annihilating naive parties. Seriously, beating this guy would prove no easy feat, even for an A ranked adventurer like Gai. The reward was twenty gold coins. Only the first three teams could claim it, but only very few people would be able to beat it and survive.

The job as the fiftieth floor's boss was scheduled to be handled by Gozer and Mezer on a rotating basis. They had evolved beyond rank A, so those who could take them down were quite limited. If you broke through the fiftieth floor, then you would receive one hundred gold coins. It was a much more substantial award, but that's to be expected if you looked at the difficulty.

![break]

"I see. Seems like a fair distribution. If we advertised it like this, would we be able to spark the competitive spirits of the nobles?"

"It's exactly like that. We can fuel their competitive drive even further by announcing the subjugators each month. Since the reward is only limited for the first time, the same person can't receive the reward multiple times. This can avoid causing excessive competition."

*I see.* If they could only claim it once, there wouldn't be a point in obsessing over fighting the bosses of the prizes. We could also prevent the same people from monopolizing the monthly rewards.

Since the amount of people that could receive the reward were limited each month, we could calculate it as a fixed business expense.

"Then, can we adjust the profit margins?"

"No problem. I've calculated based on the sales of our first three days of running the labyrinth, we may even raise the prize money a bit."

The prize money would only be a small part of our actual profit. We were merely trying to incite the participants' competitiveness and their willingness to try their luck.

Our balance wouldn't be at a loss anyways, so this was a great strategy. Someone breaking through the fiftieth floor seemed like a distant future for the time being. With that in mind, the money we would have to distribute was rather trivial.

"If push comes to shove, we could ask Masayuki-sama to break through the fiftieth floor and to promote the labyrinth but..."

"What?!"

"With Masayuki-sama it's only a matter of time."

Fufu, as expected of Myourmiles; he was proactive with these things.

He seemed to have made a plausible plan, so let's go with that.

"It's a plan. We could spread Masayuki's fame and also advertise the dungeon at the same time. We should look out for a time when the mainstream meta becomes stagnant and begin that operation then."

"I was thinking that as well. As expected of Rimuru-sama. Kufufu."

"It's nothing really, Myourmiles-kun. Mmfufuf."

I laughed with Myourmiles as I was satisfied.

"Excuse me, what about my opinion..."

Masayuki wanted to say something, but I pretended that I didn't hear it.

![soft scene break]

Myourmiles wasn't finished yet. Rather, we were only just getting to the meat of things.

"So, I want to propose something to Rimuru-sama: I wish to make the reward even bigger!" he said, giving off a wicked grin.

At that moment, I felt like he was such a reliable person.

"Tell me about it, Myourmiles-kun," I responded with a Buddha smile that showed my open-mindedness.

"I want to shock the nobles from the neighboring nations a bit and give a reward of one hundred stellars to whoever conquers the final floor!"

"...?!"

"Ho ho?"

"EH?!"

"About that---how much is that when you convert it to Japanese yen?"

*I suppose it would be around a billion Japanese yen?*

Moreover, because of the low cost of living in this world, these coins would seem to be worth even more.

"Surely, you must be exaggerating, right, Myourmiles-kun?"

"Fufufu, if we do pitch our prize like that, even the most passive of nobles would reach for their own piece of the pie. They would start hiring adventurers to participate in the labyrinth conquest."

In that case, there would be an even larger flow of money. Money comes with consumers. Once we planted the seed of interest within the population, everyone would be scared to miss out on the trend. Even those who had little care for the matter would start to be attracted.

"Bu-but, that's so much money we are talking..." Ramiris muttered worriedly. But Myourmiles, filled with confidence, was unfazed.

"Well, I wonder who's the ruler of this labyrinth?"

He asked provocatively before giving Veldora a peek.

Veldora reacted quickly.

"Kukuku, ga-hahaha! It is I, the great True Dragon. The majestic Storm Dragon Veldora!" he announced his title proudly.

"Hmm?! Where have I heard about this Storm Dragon Veldora..."

Masayuki sitting on the side was looking all mindful of something and seemed to be pondering, Myourmiles on the other hand was nodding with a villainous expression.

"Of course I knew that. Which is why, surely, there can't be anyone who would be able to defeat Veldora-sama, isn't that so?"

"That goes without saying, Myourmiles. You are truly a man of wisdom, GAHAHAHA!"

"Fufufu, it's nothing. I've learnt this from observing Rimuru-sama every day."

*Oi oi, can you not drag me into this?*

While Veldora and Myourmiles were laughing out loud, I was pondering over Myourmiles's proposal. He suggested a reward of one hundred stellars. It was a pretty insane amount of money, but it was at the same time, the prize for successfully beating the final floor. In other words, the prize for defeating Veldora.

*Well, that would be impossible.*

Though it might sound highly fraudulent, it wasn't a lie. I should say that it's still too early discussing the plausibility of that. From what I've seen so far, I really doubt anyone would truly make it to the one-hundredth floor.

"He's right. I think our labyrinth is unbeatable."

"Yup yup."

"That is most correct."

"That's right. Perhaps people can still make it to Floor 50, but the difficulty levels beyond that are beyond my imagination. Don't we even have dragons later, as well? How in the world are any adventurers supposed to defeat dragons?"

Upon saying so, even Myourmiles gave a rather baffled expression.

If someone as bold and greedy as him would not tread any further than that, it truly meant that our labyrinth was too well defended.

"I doubt we'd ever have to pay out those hundred stellars."

"That was the plan from the start. This is a bait for the nobles, therefore, I don't think it'll be a problem if we are to set the prize that high. I heard that the Holy Knights are taking up the challenge as well. I'm quite keen on seeing the result of that."

Despite putting it that way, Myourmiles looked convinced that even they would not be able to break through the labyrinth.

I agreed with him. I was terribly shocked when I heard the amount, but after I calmed down and thought it over, there was no need for me to worry about it being conquered.

"Myourmiles-kun, let's proceed in that direction."

"Yes sir, I understand."

"Then I will trouble you to do some promotion and hopefully attract more participants."

"I'll make sure to phrase it like an invitation to battle issued by the demon lord and put as much spice in it as possible!"

*Can you really advertise like that? Actually, hold on.*

Since I will continue to be the demon lord in the future, perhaps at some point, there will be foolishly daring brutes coming here to challenge me. It would be troublesome having to deal with them one by one, perhaps it would be better to announce it so that only those who make it through the hundredth floor get to challenge me... That's right. In that way, even the freeloader Veldora will become a more valuable asset.

*Okay, let's do just that.*

"Could you please add this as well, announce to the public that whoever makes it through the labyrinth would be granted the right to duel me. Masayuki, this applies to you as well. If people around you start instigating you to duel me, you can easily derail the topic using this excuse."

"That's great. Seriously, I really don't want to fight Rimuru-san. Now I am saved."

"I get you. Then, Myourmiles-kun, I'll be counting on you!"

"Leave it to me. Then excuse me, for I must leave at once."

*Myourmiles sure is a workaholic.*

As soon as the matter was settled, Myourmiles got off his seat quickly. He then saluted us and left the room.

![break]

We watched Myourmiles leave. It would be okay to conclude the meeting now, but Masayuki looked rather unwell.

That worried me a bit, so I asked: "What's wrong? Is there something that's bothering you?"

"Well, it's related to what we just discussed. People seemed to think I am still sitting on the idea, but I will probably need to fight that guy one day."

Fighting that guy---is he talking about the promise that he made during the tournament?

"By that guy, do you mean Gozer?"

"That's right... I've put the word out like that, so I can't just run away. But if I were to really fight him, I will surely lose..."

He had a point. Masayuki's Unique Skill was incredibly special and possessed great utility. However, such utility was not much practical use in combat. Actually, he could win without fighting, through clever use of his Skill. So, I suppose, in a way, it was actually extremely suitable for combat.

In any case, I couldn't just do nothing about Masayuki's duel with Gozer. Just like Myourmiles did, the audience probably had faith in Masayuki to win. And Masayuki had always acted to live up to that faith as well.

Canceling the duel at this point was out of the question.

"Would you like to get some training with the kids while Hinata is in town?"

"She will probably butcher me. I just want to live a happy and peaceful life."

Unfortunately, Masayuki rejected me with a bright smile.

*Perhaps I should show this guy a hard time for once*---with that thought in mind, however, wouldn't it be strange for kids living in modern-time peaceful Japan to be aggressive and warmongering?

*Now that I think about it, I am a lot like Masayuki.*

"Well, it will be, in a sense, trouble for me if you were to lose. So, let me think about it."

"Really? Then I will be counting on you, Rimuru-san!"

"Right, and in turn, you should help me out as well."

"Of course, I will!"

Masayuki was willing to cooperate. Nowadays his fame was very helpful for us. If Masayuki were to lose to Gozer, I would suffer great losses as well.

It was a troublesome problem that we had to resolve somehow. One way would've been to convince Gozer, but that didn't seem to be very legitimate. Anyway, I'd take my time about the matter.

![break]

After some more casual chit-chat, the emergency meeting concluded. And we began to revamp the labyrinth starting on the same day.

![soft scene break]

We were observing with high expectations. As I had predicted, we were fortunate to have corrected the problems pointed out by Masayuki. The difficulty of the labyrinth was lowered quite a bit. But then again, I had taken Myourmiles's advice as well, so it shouldn't be too simple either.

*Now then, I wonder how everyone is reacting to the changes?*

![break]

First of all, there were still many idiots who wouldn't listen to instructions. Just as before, they ignored the tutorial missions and focused on progressing within the labyrinth instead. But, naturally, there was no way they could conquer the floors that easily.

Even so, those were the inflexible people who kept on challenging floors over and over.

*I wonder what drove them to do so?*

*Could it be that they had employers? Or out of their pride perhaps?*

The answers were never noble in any way. In fact, they were more practical reasons.

The day the Labyrinth was made public, Basson's party found a rare-grade sword from the treasure chest. To them it was a most incredible weapon. It seemed that the competitors had a drastically different understanding of things compared to us.

Rare-grade equipment normally referred to an evolved version of a piece of quality equipment crafted with magisteel, after it experienced a long period of time, it eventually began to show special properties.

The magisteel produced in our nation used iron ores mined from the mountain region by the high orcs. They were exposed to the magicules unleashed by Veldora which prompted their change in quality. That's why as soon as these ores were moved to the storage section of the labyrinth, their quality began to change naturally.

Not only was it easy to source, it was of very fine quality as well. And so, we generously used it as crafting material for equipment.

Unlike the gear circulating the markets of the Western Nations, this equipment solely relied on magisteel to be crafted. Since they were different right down to the raw material, even the average gear in our nation's garrison would appear to be special-grade to outsiders. Needless to say, it outperformed the challengers' equipment by several orders of magnitude.

As for the gear worn by the soldiers of our nation, they were crafted by Kurobee's disciples. There were around a dozen of them working at the workshop. Under Kurobee's guidance, they were crafting equipment day in and day out. That's why we got to produce gear in mass.

Even these weapons crafted by Kurobee's disciples were all superior in quality when compared to the average gear being sold on the markets of the Western Nations, even approaching the quality of special-grade.

These days, their creations were all put inside the treasure chests. The failed creations were destroyed and the ones that were deemed somewhat useful were placed in the treasure chests in the labyrinth. There was good gear and bad gear, but there was, nonetheless, outstanding work among them.

One of them---a sword, barely making it to rare-grade, was taken by Basson.

The rate for getting one of them was one in a hundred. This probability seemed to be the sweet spot regarding the chance of winning the jackpot.

![break]

By the way, if it were crafted by Kurobee, even his failed work would reach rare-grade. At first glance, you may think this was good stuff, but according to Kurobee himself, these failures were just failures.

"There is a distinct difference," Kurobee declared.

So, I did some intense digging and, eventually, I uncovered some insights. While both pieces of equipment were of the same grading, each piece had a lot of variance in terms of their stats. Kurobee could identify this and tell whether his work was a success or a failure.

In fact, I compared the sword forged by Kurobee's disciple and his own creation. Both were rare-grade, yet their differences were very obvious. It was thanks to the increase in precision of my 'Analyze and Assess' that I was able to realize the differences. Had Kurobee not pointed it out for me, I probably would not have known how to tell them apart.

To give an easy example, let's say I copy a piece of equipment crafted by Kurobee. Obviously, the end product would be of the same grade. However, just like I've mentioned before, I could not recreate the quality. At first glance, the replica would appear to be the same as the original, but in truth, it was an inferior version of the original. This was the "difference."

The reason for such a phenomenon to occur was probably because my blacksmithing technique was not as good as Kurobee's.

Therefore, I concluded that weapons had many different levels of quality. While even for weapon merchants, let alone amateurs, to tell such a difference, I started to understand how to differentiate good weapons from the bad.

![break]

To those whose lives relied on the quality of their weapons, the difference could be crucial. You never knew when you would be ambushed by monsters in this world. Weapons and armor with good quality could be their life-saving tools.

During the founding festival, Kurobee's exhibition caused a stir among the public. There were even many people who wished to purchase his work. We were still considering that point, we planned to decide after doing some more market investigations.

The guardian on the tenth floor would drop rare-grade equipment---one of the best masterpieces crafted by Kurobee's disciples. While it was far from Kurobee's work, it was still a high-grade item when compared to the average gear on the market.

Adventurers, naturally, would want better gear. No wonder Basson was so happy about it. After all, for an average grade weapon, as long as its quality was nice, its price would also be ten times higher than the average ones in the market. Moreover, for special-grade, I had been told that it could go as high as fifty times the market price.

As for rare-grade, it was all up to luck whether they could get it or not. It was rarely produced, and it wasn't something you necessarily would be able to buy with money.

Obviously, there would be people who get obsessed with the labyrinth and try to come back for more.

Basson and his men were already promoting for us at the tavern.

"Hey hey, check this out, people! This is the sword that is worthy of my skills!"

Just like that, Basson and his posse were bragging with his weapon at every opportunity.

The news that the tenth floor's guardian would drop rare-grade equipment began to spread among the challengers. The news also began to reach the ears of the merchants as well as the members of the Freedom Association across the continent.

We never expected all these people wishing to become rich overnight would flood our nation. This was what led to the latest situation within the labyrinth.

![break]

I really needed to thank Basson and his party for promoting our nation.

That said, rushing straight into it was never a recipe for success in the labyrinth. After all, those who weren't willing to listen to our instructions, were always beaten by people who finished their tutorial missions before challenging the labyrinth.

Anyone with a bit of brain would know that the right thing to do was to listen to the instructions carefully first. Now, there were a lot more people who would do their tutorial mission seriously and receive their training on the first floor. The challengers were able to utilize the new knowledge they learned and apply it on the spot. There were also counters that sold various utility items, and this brought in a small fortune on its own.

![break]

Moreover---

A few days after our revamp of the labyrinth, there were teams that made their way to the fifth floor.

The second floor was merely very wide, and up until the fourth floor, most of the traps were just for show. They were not exactly malicious in any way. As long as you sketched maps of the passages, it was a piece of cake to reach the fifth floor.

That's why it was a result that we expected.

From the fifth floor onward, it was up to the challengers' abilities. The lethality of the traps increased, and there were rank D and above monsters roaming around the area. On top of that, we also began to raise the chances of treasure chest containing more expensive items.

*I do hope they will give it their best.*

While I was cheering for them, the people who made it to the fifth floor quickly got into tough fights. It was likely just because of their exhaustion. Having to be on guard against monsters all the time would easily exhaust someone mentally.

Many people returned to the stairs temporarily to use the resting zone. The business of the inns on Floor 95 had been booming as well, which was exactly what we wanted.

![break]

Later, there were challengers that started making it to Floors 5 through 8. The adventurers from different nations' Freedom Association branches had arrived as well. Among them were many skillful adventurers who were contracted by noblemen. The town had been bustling with life. People were discussing strategies with excitement.

Because of the second group of people joining the battle, the morale of people who fought first was raised as well.

It was then that some people began to cheat, ignoring proper rules of engagement and began to sell maps publicly within the labyrinth.

Some people were probably super bad with direction like I am. Something like the labyrinth couldn't be conquered with strength alone, that's why I understood why they wanted to cheat in this way, but... I hoped they would just find companions to team up and assign each other's role appropriately together.

That's why we were broadcasting, both inside and outside the labyrinth, that we would constantly change the internal layout. There were sad moans coming from the challengers all over the place, and many who just wouldn't stop complaining about it. But I was the demon lord---I was in no way obligated to listen to their opinions.

I hoped to make them realize, sooner rather than later, that they wouldn't be able to use maps not made by themselves. Essentially, if you didn't make maps yourself, you would be unable to tackle the structural change of the labyrinth during your conquest. In a sense, this was a friendly reminder for them.

*I suppose this is what they call tough love.*

The frequency of the layout changes was around once every two to three days. It would take at least a couple hours to break through one floor. It didn't seem plausible that they'd make it to the checkpoint on the tenth floor without encountering a change.

That's why the change in the layout of the labyrinth had many benefits. Challengers would start to strategize properly and give up on buying and selling maps. There would probably be people starting the conquest as soon as the layout change began and try to sketch and sell maps within the same day. Those people could do whatever they wanted.

![break]

We integrated this feature so as to prevent cheaters, and I was greatly satisfied with the result. However, we couldn't underestimate our challengers, either.

The adventurers from the Freedom Association began to challenge the labyrinth as well. There were many who were capable caster of the elemental magic 'Auto Mapping.' Exploration became extremely easy for them.

*These adventurers from the Freedom Association sure are different.*

Not only were they used to battling monsters, but their techniques were also very skillful. Moreover, their strong suit was their division of roles. Basson' party only consisted of combat-type individuals, but the parties who joined later had well thought out structure of members.

Against monsters, there were raiders who specialize in combat.

The traps and mazes were handled by explorers.

There were also knowledgeable treasure hunters^[Kanji: 採取係, it's a general term that refers to people who are good at gathering items, I can only assume it's some very obscure game/novel reference because I can't seem to find any modern trpg reference of this.].

The balance of a team was highly valued. As expected from adventurers who knew how to learn and adapt. They completed their missions with ease and challenged the labyrinth over and over.

The people who were good at exploring ruins were also good at disabling traps. They were relatively calm when stumbling upon treasure chests, they were also more cautious compared to bodyguards or mercenaries. They had been displaying work ethic beyond our expectations. And they understood the rules almost instantly. I was fortunate that we didn't make the labyrinth too easy.

![break]

And so, a few days after the different teams began to come in, there were already people who made it through the tenth floor.

The morale of the challengers was greatly boosted. They were studying the strategies of the people who came before them. Strategize carefully and progress through each floor gradually. Once a floor was beaten, the news would spread quickly. People then started to imitate their strategy.

I suppose people were actually selling information about strategies.

*Should I praise their resourcefulness?*

So now that they realized selling maps wouldn't work, they began to sell information instead. About that, I did want to commend their efforts. We wanted the atmosphere to become livelier as well.

The active performance of the challengers also became a topic of discussion among the townsfolk.

Shops, inns, restaurants---the news traveled from one to another. There were legendary stories of tragedies, comedies, and more. It was then that one story in particular was gaining popularity. There was a team that was progressing at lightning-fast speed.

They had a balanced team of ten people. What their team did to level up quickly was by sending one person to join another team that had already made it to Floor 10, register himself at the Floor 10 checkpoint and then utilized a Return Whistle to get back to the entrance. From there on, he rejoined his actual team and would start immediately from Floor 10 and onward.

We were already expecting such things, that's why we felt fine about it. Their progress had been shockingly fast, nonetheless. It only took them a short span of three days before defeating the guardian on the twentieth floor.

These guys were truly capable. Each of their abilities were up to rank B. Their entire team was close to rank B-plus. Moreover, the ten men's cooperation was extremely well-coordinated, making their actual strength closer to rank A-minus.

It was almost impossible for me to not question their innocence, considering how fast they were progressing. The reason being, that they had been choosing the shortest route almost without hesitation.

<<Answer. Spirit interference detected. 'Spirit Communication' conducted by a spirit wielder was found.>>

*Ah, so that's why...*

Spirit wielders were a special type of magic users that could command spirits. One of their magic skills was 'Spirit Communication,' the ability to hear words spoken by the spirit. If they could communicate with wind or earth spirits, they would be able to find the right path leading to the stairs with ease. Since they could gain such information, things such as maze were meaningless for the spirit wielders.

*How cunning! Spirit wielders are so cunning!*

That said, they weren't breaking any rules. Depending on the different properties of the spirits they commanded, even if they used 'Spirit Communication,' it wasn't a guaranteed way to learn the correct route. Essentially, there were very few spirit wielders out there, which was why I had never expected them to pull such a move on us.

It was a totally justified way of progressing in the labyrinth, so it didn't warrant a response from us. I even wanted to praise them for coming up with an idea like this.

It looked like their team would continue to progress at a fast pace. For each floor they made it through, their latest exploits would be broadcasted throughout town. These people rapidly rose to fame.

The name of their team was Green Rebellion---an elite task force led by a mysterious spirit wielder whose identity was a mystery.

Their popularity was rivaling even that of the 'Shining' led by Masayuki.

![break]

As we had expected, powerful people began to gather here.

Young and inexperienced challengers who dreamed of becoming famous and rich would trickle into town. And so, the number of challengers rose rapidly. The sales of the labyrinth were finally taking off.

![soft scene break]

We gathered once more.

It had been ten days since we last altered the layout of the labyrinth. Our meeting today was to discuss whether there were any new issues.

Unlike last time, the meeting went smoothly, and everyone was content.

I couldn't help but smile at the situation.

"Oi, you are called Masayuki, right? I knew from the start that you've got some balls, but it turned out that you are an incredibly courageous man."

As soon as the meeting started, Veldora, who was in a great mood, began to praise Masayuki.

"Eh, is that so? Thank you for the compliment..."

Masayuki was very confused after being praised out of the blue.

*Who is this guy?* That seemed to be what he was trying to convey through his face as he turned to me.

He was present last time during Veldora's introduction. But Masayuki was too nervous back then, so it wouldn't be strange if he had forgotten about it.

"Didn't we introduce him last time---"

"No, last time... Ehhh, the conference kind of just started on its own..."

*Eh, was that so?*

<<Answer. As individual 'Honjou Masayuki' stated, Veldora did not introduce himself.>>

*Ahh, I see. It looks like I was the one who didn't recall clearly.*

*No wonder Masayuki was confused. Let me introduce you two.*

"Then I shall introduce him once more. This guy is my good friend, big bro Veldora. I asked him to act as the guardian for the one-hundredth floor."

"Umm, I am Veldora, and I recognize you. A pleasure to meet you, Masayuki."

Veldora seemed to have recognized Masayuki as he greeted him with a happy smile. But as soon as he finished, Masayuki's face turned pale as snow. He then said: "Ehh, a-about that... Isn't Veldora that Catastrophe-rank monster that wiped out the Farmus army---?"

*Oh yeah, we did put out rumors like that.*

*It's fine to tell him the truth, but that would just be more trouble. It's meaningless to tell him about it, so I might as well just be vague here.*

"Ah yes, he is very strong, so you better not piss him off."

"GAHAHAHA! My heart is as wide as the sea, and I seldom become angry! By the way, if you were to offer me some desserts, I would be generous enough to grant you my divine protection!"

Veldora had gotten ahead of himself and said some foolish things.

I rolled up my notebook at lightning speed and gave his head a whack.

Punishment executed. Discipline is essential.

![full page image](image2)

Probably out of shock, Veldora shouted "What the hell!" I then ignored him completely and began to introduce Ramiris.

"This here is Ramiris. She's the fairy that runs the labyrinth."

Masayuki mumbled: "So I didn't remember it wrong..." almost speechless before being brought back by my words.

He turned to Ramiris who was fluttering her wings nearby.

"Uh, y-yes... So Ramiris-san is a fairy. By the way, you are truly strong to have created such an incredible labyrinth," he said to praise her.

Hearing this, it was Ramiris's turn to get a big head.

"Ohoho! Aren't you the sweet talker. Why don't you become my lackey. Also, Rimuru! Did you hear that? This guy just called me strong!" she bragged excitedly as she lunged at me with a flying kick.

*How annoying. She gets so prideful every time someone remotely praises her.*

I dodged her flying kick effortlessly and played dumb about it.

"Yeah, yeah, how strong of you indeed. That being said, if Masayuki really wants to be your lackey, I guess it would be up to you?" I replied.

*A Hero who's also the lackey of a demon lord. That's gonna be my new light novel series.*

However, Masayuki himself looked to be deeply conflicted.

"Ehhh, ehh... So, how's Ramiris-san as a person?"

Masayuki whispered next to me, and so I replied in a hushed tone, "She may not look the part, but she's one of the demon lords, just like me."

"AHH!"

Masayuki froze upon hearing that.

Ramiris approached the dumbfounded Masayuki with a smile.

*Despite keeping our conversation quiet, nothing escapes her damn big ears.*

"Yahooo! I am Ramiris, a member of the Octagram. Masayuki-chan, nice to meet ya!"

"Ah, eh? Ramiris...-san...is a demon lord? And Veldora-san is a dragon... Oh my God! There's no way!"

*Masayuki...*

He had lost himself at learning that the people in contact with him this entire time were a demon lord and the Storm Dragon. It looked as if his soul had gone to heaven.

I should have made sure to introduce them from the start. This was my miscalculation.

But it was Masayuki's fault as well. During our last meeting, he was a bit too casual and relaxed. That's what led to my misunderstanding that Masayuki already knew who those two were. I thought that this guy was quite bold, but I never expected that he didn't know about those two...

Even though they say that ignorance is a sin, it may sometimes be a blessing. To have gained recognition without himself even being aware of it, I once again realized that Masayuki's luck was not to be underestimated.

![break]

It was Myourmiles who extended a helping hand to Masayuki.

"Ramiris-sama, please don't force this upon him. It will make Masayuki-sama very troubled."

It's probably because Myourmiles was Masayuki's fan. He seemed to think that Ramiris was just joking around.

*To Ramiris's demand, the kind-hearted Masayuki must be very troubled*---that's probably what he thought.

Normally, his fantasy should have been diminished at this point, was it because of Masayuki's Skill? ---No, that's not the case. How should I put this, Myourmiles really seemed to have faith in Masayuki.

Myourmiles's will appeared to have reached Masayuki. He gave a wry smile.

"This is Myourmiles. He's a trustworthy consultant of mine. The financial department of the Tempest Federation is handled by him. In other words, he's the minister of finance."

"I am Myourmiles, pleased to make your acquaintance."

"Ahaha, Myourmiles-san is such a nice guy."

"Y-you are too kind. I'm just a black market..."

"As Myourmiles-san has said, I can't be Ramiris-san's lackey. Because I've already promised to assist Mikami---I mean, promised to assist Rimuru-san," Masayuki explained to Ramiris with an apologetic gesture.

Myourmiles followed up: "That is a good point as well. After all, Rimuru really knows his way around recruiting people." His expression was like he knew me all too well.

*I don't get it.*

Ramiris decided to join in as well, "Ah, then that can't be helped! Rimuru sure is cunning."

"Finders, keepers," I answered rather uncaringly.

For some reason, Veldora suddenly began to brag arrogantly on the side.

"GAHAHA, there aren't many reliable men like Rimuru out there. Ramiris, I'd advise you to give up on one upping Rimuru. Let's not mind that, introduce Masayuki now. Or else this conversation can't continue!"

Even though I was actually very mindful of how these people think of me, I recalled that Masayuki hadn't even finished introducing *himself*. Although, it seemed that everyone already knew his name, so this almost felt like an after-thought.

"You have a point. Then, Masayuki, please introduce yourself."

As I finished, Masayuki nodded as he replied, "Right."

"Some of you probably already know me, my name is Masayuki. I came from the same world as Rimuru-san, that's why I'm helping him out. I seem to be called a Hero a lot by people, please don't take it seriously."

Masayuki turned to face everyone, straightened his back, and began to introduce himself in earnest. When he called himself a Hero, he seemed eager to add "That's a running joke." But considering Myourmiles was present, he didn't say it out loud.

Masayuki seemed to adapt well and had already calmed down. He wasn't the least bit emotionally scarred. Even though he had already met everyone here during the last conference, it was pretty impressive of him to be able to crack a smile in front of Veldora and Ramiris.

*He's got great potential.*

Perhaps the reaction the bystanders had to him wasn't entirely the doing of 'Chosen One.' Could it be that they were simply more influenced by Masayuki's own personality? I doubt his Unique Skill alone would have such a great impact. But, well, that's something I'd have to examine in due course.

While thinking this over, everyone had finished introducing themselves.

![break]

We had all settled in our seats. Last time, we had an emergency meeting, but this time we were in no hurry. There was a casual mood in the air.

"Speaking of which, Masayuki-chan, you are really good. Our success was all thanks to you!" Ramiris shouted excitedly as soon as she was seated.

"While on the topic, Myourmiles is mighty ingenious as well. Your call to not lower the difficulty of the labyrinth was remarkably prescient!" Veldora praised Myourmiles as well.

I agreed with both of their views.

*Indeed, we can achieve great success when we all cooperate and contribute ideas.*

"You are too kind. I am glad to be of help for everyone."

"It was nothing extraordinary, it was all due to everyone's hard work!"

As they finished praising each other, we began to discuss the current state of the labyrinth.

Our performances were looking up. During the peak sessions of the labyrinth, it was so good as to make Myourmiles shout with joy. Moreover, the visitors to the town would all rest at the inns and use the services of the restaurants. I heard that business had been booming lately.

"Here are the reports," Myourmiles said as he handed me some documents.

Veldora and Ramiris were interested as well, so I gave them each a copy. I had Raphael-san run the numbers in detail. This way I would make sure that the content was in order.

*Let's see now.* I glanced through the report.

Fortunately, I could turn into my humanoid figure in times like this. Even though I *could* still read documents in my slime form, in terms of efficiency in tackling work-related matters, the humanoid form was definitely much more convenient.

It seemed that after our renovation to the labyrinth, it had been running smoothly. It could be verified by the statistics in this report.

"Looks like our promotion has had a great effect."

"Yes sir!" Myourmiles nodded happily. "It's been bustling with work every day."

I wasn't sure if Veldora and Ramiris had a clue what they had in front of them, but they were staring at the report intently.

The content was mainly the recent financial details with some special matters documented as well. For instance, adventurer ID card details.

Myourmiles asked for Yuuki's assistance so that we could check through adventurer ID cards to confirm permission to enter the labyrinth.

It was a type of magical card that also monitors the user's health status. It was a very convenient tool that occasionally recorded their status. The way to use the card was just like the explanation I got from the association's help desk, so the adventurers were all very familiar with it. Bodyguards and mercenaries who were not part of the guild were in the minority, so it was very easy to integrate the system into our labyrinth.

The fee for entering the labyrinth was three silver coins.

The card production was handled entirely by the Freedom Association. It was meant to reduce the workload at our service window. Our nation would issue a simplified version of the card as well at a price of ten silver coins.

Most people had the card from the association, but occasionally there were people who would purchase the simplified cards. Considering the profits we reaped from that process, the entry fee for the labyrinth alone earned us a sizable income.

In addition, the report also mentioned the three items crafted by Ramiris.

The Resurrection Bracelet---it was only given out for free the first time. The reason for providing a free sample was to allow people to experience the convenience of the product.

They would have to purchase it from the second time onward. The price was two silver coins, a very reasonable price. Because this Resurrection Bracelet would heal all the severe wounds inflicted before death, and then revive the person. After much discussion, we came to the conclusion that we might as well give them this little bonus effect.

In addition, if someone were to enter the labyrinth again without wearing the Resurrection Bracelet, we had to send a broadcast in order to get the attention of the person in question. Although they'd have to bear the responsibility, we still didn't want lives to be lost out of negligence.

To facilitate purchasing them, we situated the revival point next to the counter. This way, the Resurrection Bracelet became a necessity. It was selling like hotcakes---the best, in fact, among the three items.

The item 'Return Whistle' was limited to single-person usage. The benefit of it was that it could return the user to the outside instantly. It was a life-savor when you got lost. In essence, it was an item made for emergency usage. Its price was rather high, at a cost of thirty silver coins.

Those who tried to save some cash by buying a Resurrection Bracelet instead of a 'Return Whistle' should reconsider their choices. After all, while you could return to the entrance after death in this way, you also had a chance to lose your equipment. Despite keeping your armor intact, any weapons that fell out of your hands would be left behind. No one in their right mind fought while holding on to their loot, they were more likely to lay that stuff on the hallway floor. Subsequently, those goodies wouldn't be extracted, and, in a sense, it was a penalty for death.

There aren't many people who risked returning by dying, that's probably why the item sold that well.

The sale of Recording Crystal was a lot worse than we expected. However, there was a history where a large amount of it was purchased. It cost one gold coin, an expensive price as it would convert to around a hundred thousand yen. It looked like some people had the foresight to purchase this expensive item in large quantities.

You could easily utilize death to return to the entrance by using this item. I'm guessing that some people may be very stubborn in challenging the guardians, so it'd be very dangerous to give away these items cheaply. This was why we set the price this high.

Even with that being case, I still thought there would be demand for it. Upon reaching the deeper floors, the difficulty of the floors would increase drastically. Given that the checkpoint only appears every ten floors, it must give the challengers the impression of trying to reach heaven's gate.

I always thought that it would one day become profitable, even if just a little. Some people would, surely, find it useful.

There were also other ideas, such as lending weapons and armor. But they didn't seem to be profitable yet. This gear was prepared by Kurobee, they were of excellent quality. The only people using this seemed to be the ones who lost their weapons during their last attempt. However, it was slowly gaining popularity. When the rumors surrounding the amazing quality of the weapons spread far and wide, surely, there would be more people renting them.

![break]

Everything seemed to be going smoothly.

However, even if we finally landed some success, we still couldn't get careless. Times like these require even more caution.

The fastest progressing team had been doing well. So far no one had deserted. They were gradually delving into deeper floors.

Fortunately for us, they managed to inspire other challengers' motivation. They would come back to the labyrinth even after failed attempts, and our sales had been going up because of it.

*We must maintain this flow.*

*"I want to challenge the labyrinth again"*---if we could get everyone to think that, it would be surprisingly easy to get over a thousand customers in one day.

"Well then, according to Myourmiles-kun's report, we have been very successful. However, we must not be satisfied just yet. Please feel free to express any feedback you have."

In order to keep everyone on their toes, I said this to give it a head start.

Ramiris was the first to react.

"I got something!"

"Then Ramiris-kun, please take the stage."

"Well, it's about the spirit wielder's 'Spirit Communication.' It's a blind spot for us where they can gain information from the spirits! But I can actually interfere with it! So, what should we do?"

"Hmm---interference you say..."

Although I did want to sabotage them a bit, that did also seem rather despicable. Because our customers were using totally valid ways of progressing, if we were to use unethical tricks to interfere it would seem to be unfair.

This was not a war, nor some competition.

"You are sure that the spirits are not being forced into service, right?"

"No, they aren't. It's evidence that the spirits like them if they are able to build such a trustworthy relationship with them."

"If that's the case, then we shouldn't interfere. I dislike the idea."

"Right! I half guessed that Rimuru would say so."

Ramiris compromised immediately. While she did propose it, she likely didn't want to do it either.

"Indeed, lying is no good. But Ramiris, how about you create a zone without any spirit? That 'Spirit Communication' thing, isn't it used to hear what the local spirits have to say? Would it therefore be rendered useless if there aren't any spirits to begin with?"

Oh, this surprising response came from Veldora.

*He's usually very useless, and to think he's come up with such clever words.*

"Rimuru, what's with your surprised look?"

*Yikes, this guy is sharp.*

"Nothing, only that I feel truly impressed. I thought just now, *as expected from Veldora*. Your suggestion was very good!"

I panicked a bit trying to answer him.

Yet Veldora's mood was immediately cheered up afterward.

"Right? My wisdom has finally come in handy, GA-HAHAHA!"

He sure got fooled fast.

"Well, what about it, Ramiris?"

"Umm, no problem! I can ask the spirits to change their residence. Without spirits that possess will, the challengers won't be able to activate 'Spirit Communication'!"

Looks like there isn't any problem.

Thanks to Veldora, we would have a chance against the spirit wielders.

"Then I'll be counting on you. It's great to have been able to exchange ideas like that."

"Indeed, you are correct, my wisdom---"

"Yep, next one. Does anyone else want to give his suggestion?"

I can't have Veldora keep acting smug anymore.

Let's get to the next person.

![break]

The person who then raised his view was, again, Masayuki.

"Isn't it the case that you can't get any items from defeating monsters?"

Monsters upon death would drop items---these are common occurrences in video games, but it would seem bizarre in real life. I figured it was enough that you could extract materials or 'Magic Crystals' from defeated monsters...

"Will it be necessary?" Veldora asked.

To which Masayuki's answer was very simple.

"Eh? Not really, it's just that the healing potions are surprisingly expensive. High ranking adventurers may have the spare cash to use them sparingly, but most average men won't bear to use them. Instead, they would choose to flee. Some people probably think that, if you can be revived without a scratch inside the labyrinth, you might as well endure more defeats as opposed to spending the money buying potions. That's why, we might as well have monsters drop some low tier healing potions so that everyone can easily access them? But that's just my view."

Umm---he had a point.

Healing potions were among the list of things being promoted in our nation. People were gradually realizing their practical value. However, it wasn't exactly cheap. And the price had hindered the number of customers from growing any faster.

In our nation, a lower healing potion would cost four silver coins. While a higher healing potion was sold for thirty-five silver coins. And regarding full healing potions, we weren't even selling them on the market. And even if we did, it would cost somewhere around five hundred silver coins to five gold coins, and more.

The cost of living in our nation's cheapest inn, accounting solely for lodging, cost three silver coins. It cost five silver coins instead for included baths and a meal. Better inns, used mainly by merchants, cost around ten silver coins, excluding meals. This is the equivalent of a rank D challenger's entire day's worth of work within the labyrinth. The average income was around fifteen silver coins. And even with a team to improve efficiency, it fell around twenty silver coins. This income was passable for now. It was sufficient to make a living with this money.

But it may not be the case for any emergency situations. For instance, them falling sick or being severely wounded. They had no chance to experience a complete social welfare system. In addition, it was also important to maintain their weapons and armor. They'd need to replace them when they were broken. They would also have to save up money to purchase better gear.

Low rank adventurers had a hard time even hunting monsters. In order to improve their quality of life, they would have to train themselves to become better.

It was quite challenging for these people to just pay four silver coins. After all, they also had to save up for the entry fee of the labyrinth. I could understand their feelings when they could only watch and were not willing to purchase...

If they were to come across a treasure chest, they would become rich overnight, but still, I didn't think they really had the capacity to waste any of their savings.

"That is a common setting in video games. Masayuki had a point, however... All of the monsters in the labyrinth are spawned naturally. It's not that simple to have them all carry items---"

These people weren't my subjects anyway, there was no reason I should give them such convenience so easily. While I wished to help them, they should first try to survive on their own.

After all, there was Freedom Association for such circumstances. They were not the citizens of this town, so I couldn't grant them aid in the name of the nation.

Unfortunately, this was the reality, who couldn't keep up was left behind---

"We probably can do it."

As I was almost about to give up, Ramiris's carefree voice rang in my ears.

"You serious?"

"Yeah, all we have to do is to feed the items to the newborn monsters!"

Assuming we could do that, it opened the door for all manner of possibilities. We could have treasure chests keeping all the good stuff, while the monsters would drop all the garbage. But even if it were garbage, to low rank challengers, they would be a source of their income.

This would, in fact, be a welcome change for low rank challengers in the future. If you can work hard, you will be rewarded. Such an environment, to me, was most ideal.

"Then there shouldn't be an issue. You will get rewards just by defeating monsters, surely, the challengers would work even harder now."

In this way, there could be more monster materials circulating the market. It may even become a specialty of our nation. When we have enough profit, we may even invest part of it on healthcare. Any sickness would be covered, and even if you were to be severely wounded, there could be solutions. It'll be just like Japan. Having a healthcare system for all citizens will be a dream no more.

If such a policy were not implemented quickly after the founding of a nation, it would seem very unfair to the people. Because of this possibility, we should enact it as soon as possible.

The recognition of citizenship also posed a problem. The challengers of the labyrinth, traveling merchants, these people were all not citizens. They should try to register as citizens now to get their rights. At this time, the Tempest Federation was still developing. That's why we welcomed immigrants. But perhaps once our nation matured, we may even come down against immigration. The so-called nation, at its core, is just a massive mutual assistance organization. People can't live on their own, that's why they form communal groups to help each other out. That's why we didn't want any parasites in this nation. Neither did we want to accept people with no will of staying. It would be difficult to assimilate people with different ideologies to the same group.

When you possess citizenship to a nation, you are obligated to contribute to the nation. That was also why you get to enjoy the rights for serving the nation. Those who do not belong to any nation, they won't have to afford any duty and they can roam freely.

I wasn't the one making the choice. It was up to the people visiting Tempest. If they were willing to submit their loyalty to Tempest, I welcomed them. Otherwise, they were guests. We wouldn't be able to provide the same welfare that the citizens received, that needed to be distinguished.

It seemed that I need to discuss the matter in detail with Rigurd.

---And things along those lines, for once I was actually pondering over things seriously.

![break]

As I was in the midst of my thoughts, Masayuki wanted to speak to me.

"Is it true? If that's the case, we can actually mix in unidentified potions, or weapons and gear that have unknown effects. Shouldn't we do that so that people won't be able to identify which ones are the truly high-valued items?"

*Oh yeah. We are in the middle of a meeting.*

I quickly considered Masayuki's words.

*I see, I get what he meant.*

"Could it be? Are you making it so that they won't be able to use the items unless they appraise them at the counter?"

"That's it! That said, most people probably won't drink unidentified potion anyway."

"Perhaps some people would. We can mix it with poison. It can be considered as a form of trap. It can be a good reminder for people to remember doing appraisal. We gotta put it into practice."

"Cursed type equipment could prove to be an interesting challenge, but magic weapons may also be interesting. They would probably think it's trash at first, but their true quality can only be revealed after appraisal."

"That's great! You can't even toss away random trash; you have to leave the labyrinth to do the appraisal."

I began to discuss all these video game ideas with Masayuki.

Most surprisingly, an idea that we can implement was forming. We began to get excited.

Hearing our conversations, Ramiris and Veldora also got a giddy look on their faces.

"If you want them to hide their true forms, you can use my 'Illusion Magic'!"

"GAHAHAHA, I'm getting worked up just thinking about the troubled and confused looks on those challengers. Looks like I'm gonna have plenty of fun in the future!"

These two seemed highly motivated as well.

"Hmm, hmm. Trash gear is gonna take up their valuable space, so you will have to go back to town to sell them. I somehow feel like sales of the 'Return Whistle' are gonna take off," Myourmiles expressed this practical view.

Hearing his words, that did seem to be the case. It would certainly make people feel reluctant if they had to throw away unidentified weapons or armors---it would definitely trouble people who liked to roam the labyrinth for good items once such an idea was put into practice.

Every time they entered the labyrinth, it would also charge them an entry fee. The increase in the number of entries would also bring up the profit margin. After all, we wouldn't be the only one having fun now.

Unidentified---how charming does that sound? Bearing the excitement of waiting for the result of the appraisal, that was quite fun in itself. Your brain's gonna explode out of excitement.

What you thought was garbage turned out to be a treasure. In this way, even if it really were trash, people would still value it a lot. I didn't think we needed to put in too many big prizes. Instead, we could increase the drop rate of the low healing potions. That way, we could support the lower rank customers. We would need to adjust accordingly.

"I see, then it's about time we work in that direction."

"A patch update, right?" Masayuki followed up.

I shouldn't have said "about time," I did just acknowledge his idea.

With that being said, "patch update" was a great term.

"That's a nice way to put it."

Ramiris nodded along, as if she understood everything that was happening.

*Oi. Did you really get all that*---with that message in mind, I turned to her, but she immediately averted her eyes.

It looked like she was just playing along with the atmosphere. This gal only knew petty tricks like this.

Myourmiles gave off an evil grin, Veldora burst out in laughter as he always did.

We looked at each other and nodded in agreement.

![soft scene break]

Moving on to the next evening.

It was another day of serious work. I have been patrolling the town during the day---definitely not idling around for fun, absolutely not. I had also been listening to reports at night. The location was my office.

Most of the paperwork was handled by Rigurd, though some important matters would only be approved by me personally. I had someone prepare rooms in the duty hall to handle these.

"Rimuru-sama, here are the reports submitted by Myourmiles-dono," Shion said as she handed me a bundle of paper.

She had been working hard. It's like she was an actual secretary now. I was a bit surprised by her.

"Um, good work," I said in my most lord-like manner before taking the reports from Shion's hand.

It seemed to be the outline based on yesterday's meeting. Myourmiles got the documents ready at lightning-fast speed.

"Looks like everything is going smoothly."

"That's certainly good news," Diablo nodded in agreement after hearing my mutter.

"The sales in the bars have gone up ten percent lately. Looks like the lower rank challengers have been making profits. It's good for the townsfolk as well."

"Indeed. Everything is going just as Rimuru-sama has predicted."

Agreeing to my words, Diablo gently served me some black tea. It wasn't actually because I had some amazing foresight, but I was nonetheless pleased to see that things had been working as planned.

Diablo always portrayed me too positively. But, even if they were just meant to be complimentary, they sounded quite nice to my ears.

I took a sip of the black tea.

"Ehh? It doesn't taste the same as the usual one, did you change the tea?"

"Is it not to your liking?"

"No, that's not the case..."

Indeed, it's not bad. But the bitterness tasted stronger than usual.

"I-I shall change it for you at once!" Shion suddenly said in a tizzy.

But that really wouldn't be necessary. It wasn't bad at all, in fact, quite delicious.

![full page image](image3)

*Was it because black tea made by Shuna has always been too good or---wait a second, could it be?*

"Could this be---"

"Yes, number one secretary-dono insisted on preparing it herself. I've tested it for poison, it is perfectly fine to drink."

O-okay.

What a surprise. I never expected black tea made by Shion to be so tasty.

Moreover, I was surprised that Diablo was willing to help her.

"I didn't expect you to assist Shion."

Poison wouldn't work on me. Diablo's supposed poison test must have been a taste test, which was even more surprising.

"Benimaru-dono has been pushed to his limit having done taste tests every day. I supposed I was forced to do it. Thanks to this, I was able to experience feeling "unwell" for the first time. I suppose you have to be adventurous in life," Diablo replied with a smile.

I thought such an experience would be unnecessary, but I did need to thank him this time for cheering up Shion.

By the way, Shion had really come a long way. Although meals made by her were more deadly than a lethal dose of poison, I never expected her to make black tea without her Skill... Her violin performance during the concert was amazing as well. She had been a constant source of surprises lately.

That's why I was deeply grateful.

"Diablo, thank you."

"You are too kind."

"And Shion, great job. You have really been trying your best!"

"Yes! Thank you for your praise!"

It was Shion's turn to pour me a second cup of tea.

While it was still kind of bitter, I was satisfied.

It then suddenly occurred to me that I had yet to give Diablo his reward.

"Oh yeah, I forgot about your reward. You magnificently captured Farmus, and you've also helped out so much with all these tasks back here."

"No no no, I merely wish to be of Rimuru-sama's aid---"

"Even if you say so..."

I had given Hakurou a vacation. He was now joyfully training with his daughter Momiji.

As for Gobta, I took him to the elven cabaret located on Floor 95, which was only available to special guests. It was too early to give him his own VIP badge. I wanted to bait Gobta with this and have him do more favors for me.

Although, he was currently abducted by Milim...

Veldora said he wanted to train Gobta, but that would just be too cruel. I hope he won't do it.

As for Gabil, I rewarded him with a new research facility located at the deepest, one hundredth floor, behind the gate guarded by Veldora. Gabil was the acting director, while Vesta was the vice director. We had gotten more researchers as well; things were progressing very smoothly.

My other lieutenants received their appropriate rewards as well, yet Diablo, my closest lieutenant, had not been given anything. I simply couldn't let that stand.

"I actually have a request; I hope my master may approve it."

As I was worried about it, Diablo opened up saying this.

I can only say that his ability to read the atmosphere was truly impressive.

"Then speak."

"Yes sir, please indulge me. I hope you may grant me permission to recruit some subordinates to help manage miscellaneous tasks."

"Ah, you mean like preparing tea and stuff?"

So, he really did hate being the errand boy. That made sense though. Why would a powerful demon like Diablo be willing to serve tea for a slime? Even I found that strange.

"Ah, no, not that. To me, attending to Rimuru-sama's every need in life is a very important job! So instead of that, they will be handling trivial tasks such as destroying nations and other chores along that line. I hope to find some subordinates that can handle these things for me. In this way, I can always be by Rimuru-sama's side," Diablo explained with a smile.

*...Oi oi, what?*

HOW IS THAT ANY TRIVIAL MATTER? THOSE SOUNDED LIKE VERY IMPORTANT MATTERS!

But to Diablo, it seemed like the job of taking care of me was more important than waging wars against other nations.

I had no clue what was going on in his mind.

"I see how it is. But to have someone that has the power to do such tasks to be your subordinate just seems---"

This way, there would only be Benimaru or Souei when I needed to find someone who was both intelligent and capable to take on a nation.

I really would've loved to grant Diablo's wish, but it just wasn't in the cards. However, it seemed that I was making up these worries myself.

"No no no, I don't intend to overtake Benimaru-dono's status in any way. I have old friends that are capable enough to fulfill the role. I plan to try and invite them."

I see, so he was trying to find some subordinates outside our nation. Then there wouldn't be any problem.

"Then that should be fine, do you need any funding?"

*You gotta spend money recruiting people, right?* I asked upon thinking so, yet Diablo rejected the idea with a grin.

"No, they are not interested in such things as money. In reality, I require something else. That's why I hope you may prepare some bodies for them to possess."

*Oh, I get it now.*

These old friends of Diablo were probably demons as well.

"Very well, will the type of body I gave to Beretta suffice?"

If he wanted human corpses, I wouldn't be able to prepare those. Unlike when I summoned Diablo, things were very different now.

"It will suffice. I will make sure they don't complain about it."

*That's reassuring.*

It happened so that Ramiris wanted me to prepare bodies for Treyni-san's sisters. She said that they would be assisting the upkeep of the labyrinth, therefore I agreed to her request. I might as well just make a couple of extra bodies when I finished making those.

"That's good to know, but is it really the only reward you want?"

"No problem. However, regarding the people I wish to recruit, I recall they each have their own subordinates as well. I was thinking about recruiting them as well, may I do that?"

He was confident as always.

But with how he put it, it sounded like he had predicted that they wouldn't be refused.

"But we won't be paying any salaries, is it really okay?"

"If my lord is willing to grant them bodies, I am sure they will all be happy to pledge their loyalty to Rimuru-sama!" Diablo said conclusively, without a shred of doubt.

If that was the case, there was nothing more I wanted to say.

Although I would have to clarify some questions.

"By the way, how many people are you recruiting?"

According to Diablo's words, there seemed to be more than one person. Since I was crafting bodies for them, I had to confirm this first.

"Well, at most a couple hundred people. And if I have to push it, there won't be more than one thousand."

"That's so many!"

*What do you mean at most not more than one thousand?*

Were they all demons as well? Just how strong would they be!

"Are you trying to start a war all by yourself?"

"No no no, I don't think they will fight me. Even if they do, it won't be a hard fight," Diablo answered casually.

Where did this guy get his nerves of steel?

"Is it really gonna be okay?"

"Yes. I understand that their number is big. I will dispose of those who are not needed---"

"No, that's not what I meant! I'm asking if you are gonna be okay."

Diablo smiled happily hearing my question.

"No problem."

Seeing Diablo asserting that conclusion, I felt like an idiot for worrying here. Diablo may actually have been stronger than me. If someone like him said it's okay, then I wouldn't be saying anything more.

"Then I shall prepare one thousand avatar bodies."

"Would it be all right?"

"Yes, it's a reward anyway. Just remember to be careful when you are out. Don't get hurt."

It looked like there was no need for me to worry, yet I still felt the need to mention it.

Diablo looked very grateful and bowed to me.

"Understood, while I feel extremely saddened to leave you, please allow me to depart from Rimuru-sama's side temporarily."

He then bid me farewell in a more than dramatic fashion.

I really felt like just playing dumb to get over the matter.

"I'll handle the rest, just go now," Shion said, almost as if she were chasing away a hindrance.

I could sort of understand Shion. Surely, she felt the same as me.

Almost as if saying "Better tomorrow than today," Diablo seemed eager to go on the journey as well.

Honestly, having Shion as my only secretary was sort of concerning. But if anything were to happen, there was also Shuna to stand in as well. There shouldn't be anything that's gonna give me a headache, right?

Upon thinking so, I saw Diablo off with a smile.
