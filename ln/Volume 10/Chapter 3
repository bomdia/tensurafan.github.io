# Chapter 3: The Council

In the small Kingdom of Siltrosso, situated in the north, a meeting was about to begin. A young man and an elder were facing off against each other.

The young man was the head of the Freedom Association, Yuuki Kagurazaka.

The elder's name was Johann Rostia. He was the biggest financial backer of the Freedom Association and a major figure within the council, being the duke of the Kingdom of Rostia. Given his surname being Rostia, his being the elder brother to the current king of Rostia was obvious.

Yet in truth, his real identity was one of the Five Great Elders manipulating the council. They often gathered for their secret meetings in this land---the Kingdom of Siltrosso. This small kingdom on the border was perfect to fool the Western Nations, since an espionage organization held their secret base here---the best espionage organization among the Western Nations, in fact.

It was called the "Silt Foreign Information Bureau." This organization set its attention beyond the petty disputes of humans and instead aimed to deter threats of monsters. Its purpose was for crisis management.

Therefore, the agents from the agencies all had impressive portfolios. Every single member was rank B or above. They were few in number, but could all be considered as the elite among the elite. With such agents guarding the kingdom, infiltration of spies from other nations was impossible.

That was why they chose this location to conduct their secret meetings.

"Begin your report."

"Okay. Demon Lord Rimuru has completely seen through me and seems to have grown suspicious of me. That being said, I sent the eastern merchants in my stead and took various detours, so no evidence was left."

"In that case, couldn't you have made up an excuse?" Johann questioned.

"My subordinates suggested the same thing, but even if I did, wouldn't I still be in danger? This is a demon lord we are talking about! If I were to get on his bad side, it's no different than stepping on a tiger's tail," Yuuki replied.

Yuuki reported that Rimuru was suspicious of him, not trying to shroud that fact. Indeed, Johann of the Five Great Elders was Yuuki's superior. That being said, their relationship was strictly business related. The reason they preserved their relationship was due to the fact that both sides stood to gain a profit.

The Council funded the Freedom Association while the Freedom Association accepted jobs from the Council in return. The two organizations were equal in status and supported each other.

---All the aforementioned relations were a facade. The Freedom Association needed outside funds. If they were to operate in other nations, they required the respective nations' approval and care. Without such support, they wouldn't be able to continue.

While the Association had greater influence than when it was just a mutual-aid society for the adventurers, in terms of authority and power, the Council was still superior.

Moreover, the reason why Yuuki was able to expand the Freedom Association in just a span of a few years was due to the aid of the Great Elder Johann. It was also why Yuuki was willing to take on great risks in his plans.

![break]

"Not even you can beat that demon lord?"

"Don't be absurd. From what I've seen, he's got more than a hundred rank A personnel. There's no way I could deal with that."

"That's a lot. I see that it was indeed the wiser choice not to antagonize them. But---" Johann paused before turning to Yuuki with a sharp eye. He continued, "The Grand Elder has been complaining about Demon Lord Rimuru being in our way. Yuuki, are you aware that this is because of your misstep?"

"Huh---what do you mean?"

"I'm talking about your plan to work with Demon Lord Clayman. Had your plan succeeded, even without those difficult eastern merchants, we would still be able to trade with the Empire. In addition, in another couple of hundred years, Veldora would be eliminated, and Great Jura Forest would no longer pose a threat. Moreover, the two demon lords Karion and Frey would also become the barrier to protect us. Yet you..."

"Let's not go there. I couldn't have controlled what happened in the first place. I never expected such an anomaly would get in the way. That's not something I could have predicted during the initial planning."

Johann was one of the people who were in on Yuuki and his party's plans.

They had tinkered with the amusement the demon lords had conspired to set up, in order to manipulate events to their favor. It was because of the possibility of success that---

"Indeed, you are correct. It's not something you could control. You couldn't have expected a monster like that to intervene with our affairs. Nonetheless, shouldn't you be able to defeat him?"

A young girl entered from the opened gate without a sound---she was Mariabell Rosso, the person who created the first draft of their entire scheme.

There were now three men in the room.

Mariabell walked in and sat on the most luxurious seat in the room.

"Oh, oh-oh, it's Mariabell I see. Where's Grand Elder Granbell?"

"Grandfather isn't here today, it's just me. But that's irrelevant, I demand an answer to my question."

Mariabell hadn't come looking for Johann; her eyes were fixed on Yuuki. Under her watch, Yuuki spoke, "It is impossible for me. Fighting Demon Lord Rimuru alone would be difficult, and with the Storm Dragon there as well, that's not something I can handle. In fact, no human can handle that kind of threat."

"You've seen Veldora yourself?" Mariabell asked doubtfully.

"Yes, in his human form. He did, however, address himself as Veldora."

Yuuki answered honestly to Mariabell's every question. To Mariabell, this was only natural.

"I suppose you are right. Demon Lord Rimuru would be the key to sealing Veldora. If we leave that evil dragon unaddressed, it will, surely, rain catastrophe on the world. That's what Grandfather told me."

"Indeed. Grand Elder Granbell lived through the era when that evil dragon rampaged freely. He told me time and again that it was no wonder why 'God' was always so cautious."

"The evil dragon Veldora was tamed by Demon Lord Rimuru, so it would be dangerous to make a move on them. However...for the future glory of us Rosso, we have to take down the head of the Tempest Federation."

"This is a tough situation we have at hand. Yuuki, are you sure you can't defeat Demon Lord Rimuru if you bring out your real skills?" Johann asked once more.

On top of Mariabell's query, the same question was repeated three times.

*Surely Yuuki of all people would be able to defeat Demon Lord Rimuru?*

To these questions, Yuuki gave the same answers each time---although this is not exactly the case, in truth.

"Even Hinata was defeated by him; surely it will be difficult for me to triumph, should I challenge him. But perhaps my chance of success could increase dramatically in the right circumstances."

Yuuki was almost saying, "If it's just Demon Lord Rimuru, we may still come up with something."

Mariabell stared at Yuuki as she pondered.

"...Then, what are you planning?"

"Well, first we need to avoid antagonizing Demon Lord Rimuru. My guess is that even if we emerged victorious, the sacrifices would far outweigh any benefits we may reap."

Yuuki proceeded to explain their future plans, including Kagali's expedition to investigate the ruins. So, under Mariabell's order, Yuuki even gave out all the information regarding Clayman. Mariabell and Johann intended to utilize this to begin their own operations.

She had some ideas. Whether it was to neutralize or eliminate Demon Lord Rimuru completely, this matter needed to be settled. Otherwise, the grand dream of the Rosso would never come true.

While they could easily take over the world if they were to collaborate with Demon Lord Rimuru, Mariabell thought that this would be their last resort, and should only be considered when they were truly out of options.

The reason was the drastic difference in their ideals. In this life, Mariabell hoped to remove gold as the universal currency and instead promote paper money in each nation's economy. She didn't want all the available currencies to just disappear; instead, she wanted each nation to have their own currency.

It didn't necessarily have to be paper: it could be silver, copper or whatever. As long as the economy of the world converted to using paper money whose value would be determined by its nation's power, and its exchange rate reflected that.

And this power would be set by the Council; by the will of the Five Great Elders. The key to success here was for the Elders to be able to determine the value of nations. Weak countries could be taxed heavily, or they could be forced to perform laborious military service in the name of subjugating monsters. Through legal means, they could be converted into vassals of stronger nations.

With these conditions set, nothing stood in the way of their grand plan. Using the economy to manipulate the members of the Western States Council---this plan that was drafted by Mariabell, and carried out by Granbell, would be successful.

For the past few years, they had built the foundation. Yet now, this foundation was being torn up. Due to the sudden rise of Demon Lord Rimuru and the Tempest Federation, all hell broke loose with their plan.

Mariabell could already see how things would progress. Demon Lord Rimuru planned to provide a defensive force to earn the trust of the Western Nations.

Letting moderate economic relations be tolerated against the backdrop of a mighty military force. This was Demon Lord Rimuru's plan.

By using the small nation of Blumund as his base of operations, he would expand his influence to the Western Nations. In doing so, he would control the flow of goods and people would become happier doing labor while he ensured their safety.

*What kind of a joke is that*---Mariabell cursed internally.

For large kingdoms such as Dwargon and Sarion, since they were more self-sustaining, Mariabell would still tolerate their existence outside her grasp despite discontent.

Yet now---the Tempest Federation deliberately entered Mariabell's territory. Their willingness to join the Western States Council was, without a doubt, a declaration of war against Mariabell and the Rosso. They wanted to disrupt Mariabell's hunting ground. She could not accept that no matter what.

For two men to ride on a horse, one must sit behind the other. Mariabell was certain that she and Demon Lord Rimuru were incapable of coexisting peacefully. There could only be one ruler---the one with greater power. 'If you aren't the one making the game's rules, then you won't be able to win.' Since the Rosso aimed to rule over humanity, Demon Lord Rimuru was undoubtedly a hindrance. Even if they could negotiate at the start, in the long run, the two sides would eventually confront each other in pursuit of different interests.

This was why Mariabell considered Demon Lord Rimuru a threat.

![break]

Yet, to eliminate Demon Lord Rimuru---that was easier said than done. In order to observe Demon Lord Rimuru by herself, Mariabell actually attended the opening festival. She convinced Granbell that she wouldn't do anything reckless and set out towards the nation by herself.

It turned out her guess was on the money. The Jura-Tempest Federation was too charming of a nation. Its capital would surely become the city of desire and lead future trends in the wake of a new age.

This nation's value would only grow as it established more alliances and strengthened relationships with other nations. In time, the world would no longer be in the Rosso's grasp.

*Yes, that's right, everything must have been going according to Demon Lord Rimuru's plan...*

Mariabell was upset at that thought, almost wanting to break down in a tantrum. But she managed to restrain her fury before planning what to do in the future.

Simply defeating the opponent was not an option. Even if they were to succeed, they couldn't dismiss Veldora and his unpredictability. The legendary being took out twenty-thousand elite troops single-handedly. It would be most unwise to allow it to rampage freely.

With this being the case, the only solution here was to neutralize the threat---*But in what way, should we give the carrot or the stick?*

If using the stick, Duke Muze's case was a telling example of failure. Under Mariabell's careful planning, the game was to do a favor for the Demon Lord Rimuru. Yet he didn't play by the rules and instead retaliated. Duke Muze might have proven his stupidity in misjudging the situation, but his connection to Demon Lord Rimuru was worthy of praise.

*Indeed. It was extremely stupid to have alerted them so easily...*

Demon Lord Rimuru wished to join the council. It would've been easy to reject him outright. Mariabell had foreseen wars before and bought up crops and other goods in anticipation. Furthermore, due to the civil unrest in the Kingdom of Blumund, the civilians' own stores went into circulation on the market.

*We can just hire mercenaries disguised as bandits to burn down the villages around towns at night, in that way---*this way she could raise the price of the food, as well as limiting the quantity of bread in the market. If it were a smaller nation, with such a small limit, people's daily meals would become a huge issue.

Fear inspired by food shortages was the most terrifying. Such resentment would be directed towards the people who started the war. These ignorant people who didn't know any better would simply push all responsibility to Demon Lord Rimuru. By that time, the representatives of these smaller nations would then oppose Demon Lord Rimuru's entry to the council.

To Mariabell, it was child's play to execute this plan. But she had doubts.

*No good, this won't work. You can't transport rations with magic---that's common sense, but that demon lord may make it a reality. He used fresh ingredients during the night feast, there is no doubt about it. Moreover, he also had connections with major figures such as Dwarven King Gazel and the Emperor of Sarion, Elmesia. It will probably be less trouble to just accept Demon Lord Rimuru.*

If she were to oppress the smaller nations via food shortages, it might give Demon Lord Rimuru a chance to provide food support. To threaten her opponents in such a way---if she failed, she would become the second Duke Muze.

*If I were to continue the unsuccessful plan from last time, he may retaliate in some way*---this was Mariabell's conclusion. She wasn't so narcissistic to think she could just come up with the best plan on the spot. All she could do was to quietly and cautiously do what she was able to.

As such, all that was left for her was the carrot.

*If we were to give them the carrot, I would first need to meet him and discuss an alliance. As long as we can agree on conditions---no, this won't work. I can't back down now. I am Mariabell of "Greed." Even if my opponent is a demon lord, I can still dominate him! I must do this*---Mariabell thought to herself.

Her Unique Skill 'Greed' had the power to bend her subject to her own will. First, she would control her target's desire and then let her target do as she commanded. Just like what she had done to Yuuki, Mariabell began to control others without them knowing.

There were, in fact, two ways she could achieve this.

The first way: Using her own desires to overcome the desires of her subject, leading the two to agree on a goal and therefore, turn her opponent into her ally. As for the drawback of this method, it was that it could only be activated in conversation-length interactions. It was like a toxin with a delayed effect, which meant she needed to try multiple times in order for such an opportunity to emerge. However, it was difficult to avoid raising suspicion since, in the eyes of others, lasting conversations might appear unnatural.

In addition, not only did she need to find the right timing for these conversations, but the amount of 'desire'^[Ruby text reads 'Poison'] she could insert into others' minds was also limited. She needed patience to slowly achieve her goal in this way.

The second method worked much faster. She simply used her Unique Skill 'Greed' to forcefully dominate her target. It didn't take as much time, as she could directly inject all the 'desire' required and completely destroy her target's will, turning it into a walking puppet.

But this technique was too dangerous. Depending on the extent of her target's desire, it might take different lengths of time. Even if it were for just a few seconds, for someone as strong as Demon Lord Rimuru, it would be enough time for him to kill Mariabell. It could be compared to how the young Mariabell aborted the idea when she met Granbell. She would need everything prepared in order to execute this method.

These were the two ways that Unique Skill 'Greed' could be used to manipulate others. It was to be expected from a Skill that originated from humans' fundamental desires. No one could resist it.

The problem lay with the amount of time needed, as well as the extent of one's desire. No matter what method Mariabell decided to use, the prerequisites were always that the target's desire must exceed a certain amount. The greater their desires were, the easier it was for Mariabell to manipulate them.

But if her target had too little desire? Mariabell's 'Greed' manipulated others using their desires, and with little desire, her influence naturally would also be weaker. It was possible, however, for her to stimulate small desires until they were big enough for Mariabell to control, but it would also be time-consuming and could be a cause for suspicion.

That was why Mariabell could never control Hinata the Saint. It might have been different had there been more chances for the two to meet, but if she were to suddenly have a meeting with Hinata, surely, it would have raised her suspicion. Such a venture was not worth the risk, and so Mariabell gave up on manipulating Hinata.

Comparatively, Yuuki was introduced to Mariabell by Johann of the Five Great Elders, so that the two could hold secret meetings. He was easy to control.

Then, the problem here would be Demon Lord Rimuru.

*Even though I got a look up close, Demon Lord Rimuru seemed to have very little desire. Yet considering all the feats he's accomplished prior, this is just straight-up cheating...*

Mariabell had attended the night feast and seen Rimuru with her own eyes. During her stay, she determined that Rimuru's desire barely met the minimum requirement for manipulation. Even though she would probably be able to control him with a few attempts, her influence would be far from enough.

With that being said, as long as she could control him successfully, there was always a way in the future... If things went south, she could always use her trump card---

Moreover, if she were successful, Demon Lord Rimuru would be hers to command. In that way, Veldora, who had also been tamed by Demon Lord Rimuru, would also be at Mariabell's disposal. The evil dragon that even the *God* feared---that was truly a tempting thought to Mariabell.

*But I will still have to observe for a while. Then I will come up with a plan to manipulate Demon Lord Rimuru more safely!*

Mariabell made up her mind. Next, she needed to strategize the plan. Yuuki said that he would avoid antagonizing Demon Lord Rimuru. According to this plan, it was said that Demon Lord Kazalim---in other words, Kagali---would lead the way to the ruins. There seemed to be some dangerous facilities inside the ruins, but she planned to guide them safely without stirring up any trouble.

![break]

This could be utilized as part of her plan.

"I will send a letter to him. We should invite the demon lord to attend a council conference, where we can see how he reacts."

"Will the demon lord agree to the invitation?"

"Certainly. He expressly wants to join the Western States Council."

"How very bizarre."

"Rimuru-san wishes to coexist peacefully with humans. He will follow the rules of the association in order to show that monsters working under him are all friendly."

Hearing Yuuki's explanation, Mariabell suddenly understood Rimuru's actions. But in realizing that, she decided that he was an idiot. To bind oneself to rules was the equivalent of losing one's freedom. Mariabell thought it was an utterly moronic act for a demon lord to abandon his martial prowess and instead side with the humans.

"Then we shall grant his wish. I will corrupt him with my 'desire.'"

"How terrifying. Although sensibly speaking, Yuuki Kagurazaka should be powerful enough to rival Hinata the Saint. If he had fought seriously, there should yet be a chance for him to defeat Demon Lord Rimuru. You've already controlled someone as strong as him, are you seriously going to do the same to a demon lord now?"

"Yuuki has too much ambition. He himself hasn't even realized that I am manipulating him. He probably thinks that he's negotiating by his own volition."

In front of Yuuki's face, Mariabell continued to say: "That's something he should be happy about."

The reason why Yuuki hadn't been crushed by his excessive desire was because she controlled him. Yuuki, on the other hand, was silent, completely ignoring whatever Mariabell just said. That was how perfect Mariabell's control was.

"---Demon Lord Rimuru probably will be none the wiser. Mariabell, wouldn't he be like an infant in front of you? By the way, are you sure your control is flawless?"

"What does that mean?" Mariabell glared at him coldly.

"N-nothing. I'm just worried that someone may crack your control," Johann answered rather nervously.

"Your fears are unfounded. Once corrupted, a desire can never be restored---as long as it does not surpass mine."

Mariabell was greed personified, and even manifested the Unique Skill 'Greed.' There was probably no other man in this world that possessed greater desire than her. Mariabell believed this so deeply that she couldn't help but laugh off Johann's worries.

"Y-you have a point. I also have faith in you, Mariabell," Johann said, hoping Mariabell wouldn't take out her wrath on him.

Her status was next to Granbell's, Mariabell was the authentic second in command. And so even Johann of the Five Great Elders couldn't survive her wrath. And speaking of making Mariabell angry, Johann himself may also be subjected to mental domination. It was because of his blood bond with Granbell that he managed to escape such a fate. But if Mariabell were to become the person in charge one day, this might no longer be the case, Johann thought. So, he wouldn't dare do anything to anger Mariabell.

"What has been said here, you will not repeat outside."

"Of course not, Mariabell. I don't want to die just yet."

"Wise choice. Then, Johann, go send the letter to Demon Lord Rimuru of the Tempest Federation. I will draft the content later; please deliver it to him before the next conference."

Without waiting for Johann's reply, Mariabell got to work drafting the letter. Even though she wasn't even ten years old yet, Johann couldn't help but feel fear as she rapidly began writing on the parchment. But from her attitude alone, you could understand why Mariabell felt that it was only natural for her to manipulate other people.

In contrast to Mariabell, who gave off the air of a ruler, Johann, a member of the Five Great Elders, couldn't even raise his head.

"I understand, Mariabell. Leave it to me."

He then quietly left the room, accompanied by Yuuki, so as not to disturb Mariabell any longer...

![break]

Even after Yuuki and Johann had left, Mariabell continued to ponder.

Because she really had nothing much, except time. A lot of time.

She had schemed, plotted and executed her plans.

There had been many pawns for Mariabell to use.

This time was the same.

*How exciting, how truly exciting.*

Mariabell, who trusted no one, was lost in her thoughts yet again today.

![hard scene break]
Eyes wide open in shock, a man fell, blood streaming out of his mouth.

"WAHAHAHAHA! You were too careless, idiot!" Milim shouted gleefully.

At the sound of Milim's delighted voice, the remaining five men tensed up. They huddled together, staying on guard, but to no avail.

"Blazing wind, turn into a whirling tornado and cut through your enemies! Blow, Tornado Blade!"

It was a mistake to have bunched together. As if laughing at those cautious foes, the Tornado Blade I unleashed cut right into them.

Tornado Blade was an area magic version of Wind Cutter. It cost a couple more magicules, but it could be used to attack multiple enemies in a specific area. It was great for taking on a full squad of enemies.

Milim ambushed the people in charge of checking traps as they were walking at the front. After quickly injuring her opponents, she had left the scene before I cast the magic.

The people to the rear of the squad had no clue what even happened. But as they became alerted, I followed up the attack with the Wind Cutter. It didn't affect Milim, and my magic took out the entire enemy squad.

"Shit, it's the Crimson Comet! Everyone, watch out!"

"Sonuvabitch, Majya and Najya have been taken out by the magic. Jean also stopped breathing!"

"Bastards! You whoresons! How dare you kill them?!"

The enemies roared in rage upon realizing what was going on. They were, in other words, the challengers of the labyrinth. It looked like a relatively balanced group of adventurers this time. However, our experience and strength were both far superior to them.

We took the initiative and took out the explorers within the enemy team. In order to make use of their being unaware of our presence, we made a preemptive attack using anti-group magic. Before discovering the enemy team, we would operate with invisibility magic applied. We would always see them coming first.

Once we attacked, the invisibility spell would deactivate, but by that time, we would have downed at least one or two men. They were usually the mage or healer at the back of the team, providing support. At this point, it's like the game had already been decided.

As we came out of our invisibility spell, the enraged vanguards quickly discovered us and charged.

"GAHAHAHA! YOU ARE ALL TOO NAIVE!"

"WO---HEHEHE! DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT LEAVING THIS PLACE!"

Veldora and Ramiris, fully immersed in their roles, handled the assault.

Since there was no need for me to show up, I decided to hang back and just provide aid for the two of them. I also used analysis magic to investigate the warriors charging at us. There were red health bars above all of their heads which had dropped below half at that point.

"These people have less than half of their HP. Surely, you two would be enough to handle these guys?"

It wasn't that I was getting ahead of myself, just confirming the state of our enemies.

Indeed, the red bar above the warriors' heads indicated their hit points. Only I could see it due to the analysis magic. To make everything clearer, I made it so that it would look like something that would be in a video game. Even if other people used the same type of magic, they would probably see it differently.

That aside, it was convenient enough for me to use. Seeing things being expressed in a familiar manner, I was able to quickly identify the situation and give the appropriate commands.

Considering how things had developed, we had this one in the bag.

Without the supporting aid from the back, the vanguard didn't stand a chance against Veldora and Ramiris. They had no defensive buffs, spell or healing. With their HP decreased, they had no chance.

If this were a more cautious team, they would have had a 'Barrier' set up at all times... But it seemed that the team wasn't really that type.

And so, Veldora and Ramiris happily slayed the three remaining foes.

It was an easy win.

With Milim's sneak attack on top of my magic, we were able to take out the scout and the rear guards---and that was our "gg ez" strategy.

However, we'd been picking too many fights lately, and it was inefficient. Even though the challengers' strategies hadn't been perfected, there were certainly more people thinking about them. The labyrinth challengers weren't stupid. They were trying hard every day to improve as well.

While that was certainly pleasant to hear, we also had to reconsider our engagement strategy with them.

---As I thought so, the last man in front of us disappeared, fading away in beams of light.

The battle was over.

I'd seen this scene a million times at this point.

"Amazing! These rookies were no match for us either!"

"WUHEHE, that's it! WE ARE THE STRONGEST, THE INVINCIBLE!"

"GAHAHAHA! THOSE ROOKIES WEREN'T EVEN ENOUGH AS MY APPETIZERS."

My companions had gotten smug enough to brag about their achievement.

Indeed, we four made up the team.

---Eh, you want to know what we were up to all this time?

That goes without saying. We were using labyrinth challengers as the test subjects for our strategies.

We all loved learning and had been studying tirelessly every, single, day.

.........

......

...

Umm, but what about the whole Green Rebellion deal from last time?

It had been a great win, but we weren't satisfied just yet. We hadn't seen the team Green Rebellion ever since, either. They were apparently called back by their home nation, possibly never to return.

With that being said, it might also have been because they had difficulty obtaining new gear for new floors. I was not sure whether they would return one day or not, but we had to get ready to fight them, nonetheless.

That's why, even if we had defeated Green Rebellion, we were going to keep roaming the labyrinth in secret to fight off challengers. In addition, another reason was the increased popularity of the labyrinth.

![break]

Several days had passed after our fight to the death with the Green Rebellion. Masayuki's party managed to break through Floor 49.

Masayuki was the real lucky star as he managed to collect the Ogre weapon series. With it, they successfully defeated the tempest serpent, and now they aimed to challenge Floor 50. With Masayuki's party making it beyond Floor 49, the other challengers became much more motivated. And as we'd hoped, many capable individuals set their sights on Floor 49.

We publicized the video footage of the guardian fight as a test and it was received very well. We used the video projector to record the fight between Masayuki's team and the tempest serpent. It became a hot topic even within the town as people kept on requesting to replay the clip.

There was money to be made with this---Myourmiles and I thought to ourselves. There was no television in this world, so the battle footage within the labyrinth was considered to be top tier entertainment. But, obviously, considering the potentially gruesome scenes that would be showcased, we considered editing the footage beforehand.

However, some people seemed to prefer the uncut version. Therefore, there was some room reserved for negotiation in that regard---mainly depending on how much the people asking would pay.

There were also issues regarding the broadcasting rights, portrait rights, etc. All of the cumbersome formalities were handed to Myourmiles.

Masayuki's smile could probably be its own merchandise. That patented smile alone would earn us a sweet sum of money. In that way, Masayuki would get some benefit, and Myourmiles and I would also be counting cash. Apart from learning from the mistakes, we were also looking forward to the future development of the labyrinth.

The video footage was not limited to the video directly recorded by the magic item. We had actually saved a lot of things. Raphael-san also extracted a large amount of data from the labyrinth. By conducting "Analyze and Assess" on it, it was possible to recreate the images. We also made video compilations of cool performances by the challengers and broadcasted them.

They turned out to be a big hit. Some people were even saying "Thanks to this footage, I got to have a girlfriend!" Many people who wanted to become famous were tempted to give it a try. Even people who weren't serious before, began to put in some hard work.

I mean, I knew the feeling.

Even though it might be cruel to say this, at least they put in more effort. But in front of them was a high wall called reality. Don't be too idealistic just yet! On the notion of giving tough love to our contestants, *we* began to interfere with the challengers' progress.

![break]

Nowadays we were called the 'Dungeon Dominators'^[Kanji reads "Reapers of the labyrinth"], feared by all.

Our appearance also had some drastic changes.

The ghost controlled by me now had youki surrounding it, engulfed in blue and white flames---a Fire Aura. I found this to be a very stylish look for me.

As for Veldora's skeleton swordsman, all of his bones were renewed. Seeing how Ramiris's armor changed, Veldora wanted to renew his bones as well.

I asked him what he wanted, and he responded rather recklessly, that "A gold skull suits me better." I was just going to ignore his request at first. But since I also had Diablo's request to handle, I tried to change my perspective on the matter and thought that I could use Veldora as an experiment for temporary flesh replacement. I wanted to test the metallic skeleton body's abilities, so I decided to exchange that with Veldora's avatar.

Ordinary gold wasn't very strong. That was why I decided to utilize the strongest material I had available instead, though it was still in the experimental phase.

It happened to be golden as well, so I decided to go ahead with it. It was called 'orichalcum'^[Orichalcum or aurichalcum is a metal mentioned in several ancient writings, including the story of Atlantis in the Critias of Plato.], a special alloy refined from a mixture of magisteel and gold, while also infused with an unusually dense concentration of magicules. I wanted to combine the immutability of gold on top of the traits of magisteel.

The result was very successful, not just in terms of strength. The overall performance of orichalcum exceeded magisteel; it was an incredible metal. And so, orichalcum was born.

The problem with it, however, was the difficulty of its production. Gold itself was already rare and could not be produced en masse.

However, this time I humored Veldora's request. Which was why I spent a hefty sum of money making the orichalcum and fabricating the humanoid skeleton.

As with Ramiris' outfit, all we needed was a Master Core, since it didn't matter what type of skeleton we had installed for Veldora. And in the blink of an eye, the golden skeleton swordsman was born in the labyrinth.

His bones were insanely strong, nothing like his previous skeleton.

I closely observed Veldora's skeleton swordsman to examine its durability, as well as any potential flaws.

Milim's reputation, on the other hand, was even more far-reaching. People were all afraid of the infamous 'Crimson Comet.' With her abnormal speed, her afterimage looked like a red comet.

She abandoned all her techniques besides speed and focused on landing critical hits to achieve victory. This fighting style instilled fear and made her a legend.

Ramiris's style also changed slowly. She became the brawn type and had been giving off an ominous energy around her. She glowed with purple flames---her heavy animated armor was enveloped in an aura of death.

She would wield her Grim Reaper's great axe to crush her enemy and never backed down from a fight. This ended up giving her the reputation of the crazed heavy animated armor.

Her avatar might be stronger than her... No, never mind.

For the sake of Ramiris's own reputation, it was best to let matters lie.

![break]

And so, in a span of a few days, we all became famous.

The challengers' response was pretty good as well. They all seemed to be afraid of us and kept their guard up against us. We were stronger than most low-level bosses, and also much meaner.

It was only natural for the challengers to react this way.

As I said before, our primary objective was to study how to fight within the labyrinth. We definitely weren't just messing around for fun. You MUST not confuse that. We had been working hard every day and diving into our research. Surely, with the hard work that we'd put in, it would be useful someday.

In fact, we had seen many challengers using rare Extra Skills as well as seemingly original magic spells. We had learned a lot from it.

Nowadays, Raphael-san could extract intelligence from the labyrinth directly, using 'Analyze and Assess,' and so the labyrinth had become a vault of information.

In addition, just as our own techniques would be reflected on the avatars, the things we learned via the avatars would also come back to our original bodies. This was an unexpected outcome, but was quickly considered as a new way to train.

And so, we performed our research every day.

Naturally, we made an ample number of new discoveries.

![break]

There was one time that we got a bit too arrogant and decided to challenge the entire labyrinth with our team.

We quickly met our disastrous defeat.

With our abilities alone, we could not even get past the guardian on the fiftieth floor---Gozer. We couldn't hold a candle to opponents above rank A if we were to fight fairly. And even if we were to sneak attack, it wouldn't have worked on Gozer. He was like a brick wall standing in front of us.

On one hand, we wanted to praise him for his competence, but on the other hand, we were thinking, "Now we will have to defeat him." And based on this thought, we began to train our avatars with great enthusiasm.

It was a form of learning one way or another. The process of training and self-improvement. And DEFINITELY not messing around for fun.

Seriously, please remember this point in particular!

.........

......

...

And like that, we watched the challengers as they gradually disappeared.

"That was an easy win."

Hearing my comment, the other three nodded in agreement.

This was around Floor 38. The rank A-minus tempest serpent was almost in front of us. Its power wasn't just for show, as its above average strength was much greater than that of most challengers. And to us in our avatars, if we were careless, we would also fall into a tough fight.

Considering our growth rate, this was the perfect hunting ground. It was best to continue at this pace.

Upon thinking so, my emergency contact 'Clone' in the office suddenly reached out to me.

*What happened?* As the thought crossed my mind, the message delivered by it to me was: "There is a guest that requires urgent attendance."

*Looks like this is no time for playin*---

No, no. Learning, not playing.

This was important, we would remind everyone again to not mistake the two things.

Time to head to the office.

![soft scene break]

By the time I got there, Shuna and Rigurd were already waiting.

There was someone else. A familiar female, ah yes, her. Ex-Demon Lord Frey was sitting in my office. Apparently, the VIP was her.

She turned to me first as I entered. Her eyes then momentarily landed on Veldora before stopping on Milim, who entered the room last. She smiled.

Hm? Why did that smile look so unwholesome?

"Ara, Milim. So this is where you've been? Speaking of which, did you finish the work I assigned to you? The people who were supposedly guarding you were tied up and put down. Could you please explain to me what happened during that time?" Frey said, still smiling.

![break]

This was more like an interrogation. Honestly, super scary.

Even though I wasn't the person being questioned, it still felt mighty uncomfortable sitting in the room.

Indeed, my friend should have finished all her homework before playing with us. But now she'd been caught, not even having started it yet, by her parent and was being scolded---that was the scene I saw before me... How very reminiscent.

But as for Milim---

As her eyes met with Frey's, she began to panic. "EH! F-Frey? N-no, that's not it at all. There's an important reason for that---!"

![full page image](image7)

*I mean... You're done for, Milim.*

I'm gonna put a disclaimer here. This whole incident had nothing to do with me---us---at all. *Right?*

"Ha-hahaha, Milim, you should have told us that you had work to do. I won't be keeping you waiting, go back now and finish the work early!"

"U-umm, that's right. I'm so sorry to have kept you around for our research. You should have told us if you had work to do. It was our mistake to have asked for your cooperation, we have to apologize!"

"R-right! I mean, aren't we close and all, Milim? You should have just said it, we wouldn't have kept you around like this!"

Sensing what was happening, Veldora and Ramiris also verbalized their support.

*How very impressive. This was true teamwork here.*

Now that we'd distanced ourselves from Milim, we were safe.

Milim looked at us with tears in her eyes. But all we could say was, "Sorry, the chances of you being saved seemed slim."

Or rather, "Please don't drag us down with you."

"N-no, it's not what it sounds like. H-hear me out, Frey!" she insisted, emphasizing her innocence to the very end. However, her defenses were futile in front of Frey's fixed smile.

And so, Milim was captured by Frey. With Frey's claws at her neck, Milim couldn't fight back. In the end, Milim was dragged back to her kingdom.

![break]

Phew, that was horrifying. We almost got dragged down with her as well. It looked like we made it through.

And just when I felt reassured---

"Speaking of which, Rimuru-sama, where have you been and what have you been doing?" Shuna asked harshly, suddenly appearing behind me.

Even though, in theory, I couldn't sweat, I still felt the sensation of it flooding down my forehead.

*No, it was all right. We would be fine. We were definitely not playing. Research, yes! We were doing research this whole time.*

After settling on my defense, I tried to excuse myself.

Yet Veldora spoke before I could: "Looks like we're getting in the way here. I should go back to my room to indulge in the intricacies of sorcery. Sorcery is profound and worth studying---" he muttered before taking out his manga and walking away.

*Is he trying to flee now?*

I panicked as well, but it was too late.

Making up some nonsense excuse, even Ramiris betrayed me. "T-then I shall go too..."

Veldora and Ramiris teamed up and slipped away.

*What the hell are these two doing?! Why are they especially cooperative at times like this?*

But I didn't have time to think about these "great friends" of mine. If I didn't come up with a good excuse, Shuna's wrath would be terrifying. If I were to use any random excuse as filler, I could get myself killed here.

With how things had developed, I couldn't really defend the position that we were just studying.

Seeing that Veldora and Ramiris had fled, all of my brain cells switched into overdrive to find the most appropriate answer. Yet, nothing good came up. However, this was no time to lose my nerve. Since I'd reached this point, it was time to pull my trump card---*it's time for you to shine, Wisdom King Raphael-san!*

There was no need to be afraid at all. I had the shining beacon of wisdom known as Raphael-sensei at my aid.

*Please help me through these tough times with an awesome excuse*---I prayed to myself and asked Raphael-sensei.

Its response was as follows.

<<Answer. There is no need for an excuse. The problem can be resolved by being confident.>>

*What? You say that there's no need for any excuse? The problem could be resolved by being confident, what did that mean*---

Suddenly, someone ran into the office in a panic. "Ah, so there you are, Rimuru-sama, I've been looking for you!"

It was my good friend Myourmiles-kun.

*I see, so that's what it meant. God was on my side with this one.*

Myourmiles was my savior!

"Oh, oh, Myourmiles-kun. I figured that you would be here by now."

Raphael-sensei wanted me to be confident with the thing, and I did what it suggested, playing along as if everything was according to plan.

Hearing my response, Myourmiles looked momentarily shocked. But he quickly realized what was going on and began to nod his head vigorously.

"How impressive, Rimuru-sama. The council just sent us a letter. Have you seen it already? The letter was sealed pretty tightly; my guess is that they want to invite you to attend the council meeting to judge whether our nation is fit to join---"

*What, the council sent a letter, you say?*

To judge whether our nation was fit to join---Did that mean they would be considering the addition of the Tempest Federation?

I would be looking forward to this.

Speaking of which, Raphael-sensei sure was impressive.

Could it have even predicted the time when the council would make a move?

No, how could that be possible? That was impossible---

<<Answer. The team Green Rebellion was hired by the Kingdom of Ingracia. Deducing from the time frame, their main objective would be to investigate the internal affairs of Tempest. In addition, according to the investigation of the individual 'Souei,' all the espionage agencies of different nations reported back to their home countries at the same time. Based on this information, the council would most likely take action during this period of time.>>

*S-so you can actually calculate that.*

Everything was according to Raphael-sensei's calculations!

---*Not to mention that Souei reported back. Why didn't I hear anything about that...?*

<<Answer. Master was busy playing games and likely chose to ignore his words at the time.>>

It called it playing games!

It was impossible to lie to yourself, and it seemed that I couldn't lie to Raphael-sensei either.

That was fine, I guess.

Up until the time when we fought Green Rebellion, we were all very serious, but we ended up losing ourselves playing around. That was the truth. But there was one thing for sure---Raphael did save me this time. Thank goodness I didn't have to make up any weird excuses. I spoke as if I'd seen everything coming.

"That's indeed the case. Their investigation team was in the labyrinth as well, so I stayed there to have some fun with them. They went back to their home nation in a panic, so I assumed it was time for them to make their move."

"OH, OH! Could you be referring to Green Rebellion?"

"That's it, Myourmiles-kun. They were a bit too strong, so I decided to investigate their suspicious activities."

That was a huge lie.

All of which came from Raphael.

But that didn't matter.

"I see, so you were investigating in secret... As expected from Rimuru-sama!" Shuna smiled and nodded in satisfaction.

![break]

Thanks to my justification, I managed to fool her. Crisis averted. I took the letter from Myourmiles's hand to check its contents. It did state there that they are inviting us into the council. This proved Raphael right and saved my face as well.

However, this was a close one. Addictively playing games would lead to failure---I needed to remember this lesson well and swear to moderate my play time in the future. Everything should be in 'moderation.' I needed to be more careful in the future. I reflected to myself.

![hard scene break]
The council---the Western States Council---was made up of different nations surrounding the Great Jura Forest. The councilors elected by each nation would attend the meeting in Ingracia every month. Strictly speaking, unlike councils run by nations, the main goal of the council is to maintain everyone's financial interests.

They wouldn't put smaller nations on lower priority, and instead start off from the point of equality. People would cooperate with each other. All of the members aimed to uphold the idea of defending the good of all humanity.

The good of man referred to maintaining the circle of survival for humans. Apart from taking care of monsters, they also needed to handle droughts, plagues, typhoons and earthquakes. They had a duty to draft out plans to respond to crises.

Also, the policies on importing and exporting surplus food, specialties and other goods differed from nation to nation. Due to this reason, negotiation on these subjects became very difficult. Therefore, the council only discussed motions relating to actual rescue efforts.

If there was a famine, they would dispatch food to aid; if there was a large number of monsters, they would send reinforcements to aid them, and so on.

It was not easy, and it would potentially lead to a series of problems as well.

The council was funded by each nation, and the proportion obviously would differ. The fund would fluctuate depending on the size and scale of the nations, yet at the same time, all nations shared the same privileges. This led to some dissatisfaction, and therefore, the number of councilors for different nations needed to be increased when more responsibility was undertaken.

However, with no restrictions to this rule, nations were no longer equal to each other. Thus, another rule was set. For every new councilor added to the council, their percentage of the emergency fund would also be raised accordingly.

However, with more councilors in place, it obviously implied greater influence. The larger nations had long realized this point, and would give away several times more money than they normally would just to have more power within the council.

As mentioned, the council's actions were not directly related to national interests. However, it was still a convenient venue for the more powerful nations to show off their strength.

The more say a nation had in the council, the more likely they could turn things to the favor of their own nations. And in times of crises, they would also be able to protect their own nations first.

![break]

Motions, such as the distribution of acquired funds, would be decided by majority votes within the council.

For example, let's assume some highly dangerous monsters have appeared.

The Freedom Association under the command of the council would take on the monsters.

The council would issue missions to eliminate the monsters and have the association hire adventurers. However, the monsters would not appear alone.

What if these dangerous monsters were to appear simultaneously in several kingdoms?

Obviously, larger nations with greater authority would enjoy the privilege of receiving protection first and getting the better skilled adventurers.

That was only to be expected.

The fact alone that they offered greater funding contributions showed that they were of higher standing among the Western Nations.

People didn't invest their limited resources to protect the useless. When they could afford it, they would help them, but if they couldn't, they would be cut off---as it stood, the weak were simply abandoned. This was merely the reality played out as a game of numbers.

For that reason, the council did not tolerate council members delaying the payment of contributions, and had also drafted a minimum amount to be given. Inability to pay up was met with a swift eviction from the council.

For weaker nations, this meant that there would be no reinforcements in times of crisis.

The council had the duty to make these judgements. Hence, it was only natural for things to have developed this way due to the larger nations within the council having more authority.

That being said, these contributions were not cheap. They increased with the number of councilors sent by a nation. Even the kingdom of Farmus, which once had the largest number of councilors, could only send at most five. This made the destruction of Farmus a significant matter that the council could not ignore.

As they were about to make contact with the newly risen Farmenas, a more troubling issue came up---the rise of Tempest.

This naturally led to the council being shaken internally.

After the Tempest Founding Festival, the council held an emergency meeting.

It was pandemonium. The councilors argued in chaos.

![break]

Even Hinata Sakaguchi was invited to observe the chaotic state of the council. Since she knew Demon Lord Rimuru in person, she was invited as an eye-witness.

Hinata could have refused. Unlike the Freedom Association, the Western Holy Church was not a subdivision of the council. While both parties could mutually benefit from each other, they were two separate organizations functioning under different systems.

As the head of an external organization, Hinata had no reason to answer their invitation. However, after learning what the topic of discussion would be at the meeting this time, Hinata decided to participate.

The motion: whether to allow the Tempest Federation to join the council.

The topic this time would provide vital information about the future of the Western Nations. With that in mind, Hinata decided to show up.

She was rather repulsed by the council members that fell into disarray.

*So, this is how much chaos ensues after a bunch of useless fools gather in the same room...*

When it came to the Holy Knights' own meetings, Hinata was in charge of everything. As a result, there were no major conflicts, and less time was needed to settle the discussion.

*In worst case scenarios, I can always shut everyone up by force*---it had always been Hinata's policy to employ more practical means of persuasion in resolving issues during their own conferences.

She also attended the meeting in Tempest the other day. Even with all those shockingly important figures attending, the important motions were passed swiftly. Hinata couldn't have imagined such a scene prior. For the entire time she was there, she couldn't help but think:

*But I suppose I can make that an exception. Isn't it about time that we have a more constructive way of discussing issues?*

She had always experienced more constructive conferences. To her, the current conference was a complete mess.

"That nation is definitely worthy of our trust! I think we must let them join!"

"Even if you say so, this is the demon lord we are talking about here! He seems to be able to communicate with that Storm Dragon. If we were to piss him off, what's to say that he won't set that dragon against us?"

"There's no need to worry. As the saying goes, he's a donkey in a lion's hide. The demon lord himself probably doesn't have much power."

"How laughable! Then how would you explain how he managed to reach a tie with Hinata-san over there? We must assume that the demon lord himself is also very capable!"

And so, different parties with their own twisted opinions refused to reach a consensus.

*What an idiot. You dare to talk about that when I'm right here. It's pretty impressive how empty-headed someone can be,* Hinata thought to herself.

These people were seriously discussing who was stronger while Hinata herself was present. That was truly amazing to her.

"Listen carefully now, during their founding festival, Demon Lord Rimuru said that the whole of the Great Jura Forest is under his command. But at the same time, he also said that he wouldn't allow any monsters to go outside the forest. These words are highly significant. Everyone, please discuss with these considerations in mind!"

"Indeed. In our nations, many people have lived in fear of the monsters. What the demon lord has announced is the saving grace to them. In fact, since the birth of the Tempest Federation, the disasters brought upon us by the monsters have also been reduced."

"Quit spilling nonsense! Have you all been brainwashed by the demon lord?"

All of the monsters in the Great Jura Forest were managed by Demon Lord Rimuru. A lengthy border connected many different nations to the Great Jura Forest. And those along this border all benefited from the founding of the monster kingdom.

There were also the nations neighboring Tempest.

Some nations, on the other hand, felt threatened by other factors.

Others still were situated relatively safer in-land.

And due to these different geo-political predispositions, they all had different opinions as well.

The nations welcoming Demon Lord Rimuru's nation were all neighbors to Tempest. They all attended the founding festival and witnessed the prosperity of that nation.

It didn't matter if Tempest was the monster kingdom. If it could benefit their own nations, it was welcome to stay---that was the stance of these nations.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, the nations that had other threats to deal with were uncertain about their decision. These nations were under the protection of the Freedom Association and the Holy Knight Order, therefore they had less problems caused by the monsters. They only had a small army and didn't want to make any reckless moves.

This was the same for every nation; it was already taxing enough to maintain their current status quo.

The sharper nations had already begun to strategize about how they could use Tempest to their own ends. However, some nations never participated in the nation's founding festival. And some nations didn't want to trust monsters from the get-go.

As they continued to argue, the weaker nations could only side with the majority.

As for the stronger nations and their vassals---they mostly agreed with Tempest's addition. With their own safety in mind, they also considered how much profit they could gain as well.

Those who were skeptical towards Demon Lord Rimuru's policies held the opposition. These people blindly believed that if anything were to happen, they would be the first to be attacked by the demon lord, and thus, frantically opposed the decision. Some even argued that the nations neighboring Tempest had all been bought by the demon lords and were traitors.

With such conflicts of interest, it was only natural that the council would be in turmoil.

If we were to take a step back and observe, there was nothing more idiotic than this. But with that being said, most councilors were merely trying to protect their own nation's well-being.

Hinata could relate to the feeling, which was why she kept silent, but...

"Then we should allow them to join. If they wanted to join our ranks, we should welcome them with open arms. Then we can ask them to bring offerings."

"Umm, that is a good idea. If we were to be hostile against them, we would only be repeating Farmus's mistake."

"However, we must make sure that they understand their standing. We should see if they were willing to abide by the international laws that we have drafted---"

"It shouldn't be a problem. Has everyone heard the tragedy of Duke Muze the Foolish? ~~I thought not. It's not a story the monsters would tell you. It's a Rosso legend.~~"

"Yes, we all knew about this."

The problems were mainly caused by councilors sent by the larger nations. They were already holding information that was not accessible to most. And with them fanning the flames of the already chaotic council meeting, it only made things messier.

Their goal, on the other hand, was plainly obvious. These people had already reached a conclusion and were simply luring everyone else onto that path. They were trying to make it seem natural.

*Those poor small nation councilors. They were forced to make a choice without even knowing. It's no different than them forfeiting their votes...*

Ignorance is a sin too, and not knowing the correct information would become a huge loss in itself.

The weak were tricked to forfeit their precious vote.

However---

*Since their conclusion was to allow the Tempest Federation to join the council, it's exactly what I wanted.*

The goal of the large nations aligned with Hinata. While this was certainly a disservice to the weaker nations, it was the right choice in Hinata's opinion to not help them out here. All she needed to do was endure for the time being.

"What Demon Lord Rimuru is planning doesn't matter. It matters whether he can be useful or not."

"Indeed. We are all worried about the movement of 'the East' these days. If the demon lord were to make up for our military strength, there's no reason for us to reject them."

It was then that one of the councilors of high-standing within the council, Johann Rostia, duke of the Kingdom of Rostia, suggested that the Eastern Empire was on the move.

"'The East'? Could you be referring to the Empire?"

"Do you mean they are on the move? But now, Veldora occupies the Great Jura Forest..."

Johann's words caused an uproar among the councilors.

And soon enough, all the attention in the room was on Johann alone.

*Now we've gone down to the real business*---Hinata thought.

It was all too typical of noblemen to hold lengthy preambles before addressing the heart of the matter. They would first beat around the bush with each other to probe what information others held, and how deep that understanding was. Once they were convinced of having the upper hand, they would show their true colors. This was how they operated.

And following this exact playbook, Johann had managed to dominate the scene.

"As you are all aware, the Eastern Empire---the Eastern Sovereign Alliance of the Nasca Namrium Ulmeria Empire's military units have moved out recently. According to reports by the merchants coming out of the area, they have been actively conducting military drills."

Johann's words calmed the hall down immediately.

Hinata knew about this as well. Dwarven King Gazel, whose nation shared a border with the Empire, also knew about this.

They probably were learning about the Empire's movement via the dealing of healing potions and equipment. The Dwarven Kingdom was a neutral nation. King Gazel must have kept silent in order to maintain their neutrality. In addition, Rimuru would obviously know this as well.

The proof was the technology he showcased during the nation's founding festival. Rimuru was playing dumb and said that "This was just the result of their liberal research," but that was not the case in reality.

It was probably a threat to King Gazel.

It may be a stretch to call it a threat, but Rimuru was implying that the Tempest Federation was now the one producing all of the healing potions.

*They should not be underestimated. He knew of the Empire's movement, in spite of King Gazel hiding the truth away. So Rimuru wanted to restrain him as well. Just how far has he foreseen? All I can say is that you are impressive---*

These were Hinata's thoughts.

Unbeknownst to Rimuru, she had spectacularly misunderstood him.

Hinata caught wind of this information long ago, but for most councilors gathered here, this was shocking news.

Everyone was waiting for Johann to continue, having experienced such shock. They wanted to gather sufficient information so that they could plan and protect their nations.

It may be the case for large nations with military reserves, but for smaller nations that couldn't spare the expense to train an army, they didn't have a large army.

Hiring mercenaries during wartime was not uncommon, but if all of the nations were to begin stockpiling their war effort at the same time, there wouldn't be enough soldiers to go around.

"Everyone, please calm down. The Empire won't strike anytime soon. We need to discuss this calmly and strategize!" Johann announced.

Hinata's guess was spot on. *Now we are finally getting to the meat of it.*

"Then, what do you suggest we do?" one of the councilors asked, followed by many.

"Strategize? What good plans do we have even?"

"Farmus is gone now! Even if we were to place a defensive line, us small nations wouldn't be able to hold our ground!"

"Calm down! The reason why the Empire has held back all this time was entirely thanks to that beast lurking within the Great Jura Forest. It may be a different case if it were sealed again. Thank god for its resurrection!"

"Wait, hold on? Are we going to rely on that evil dragon now..."

"That's why you all have to stay calm! Hasn't Veldora been tamed by the demon lord---by His Majesty Rimuru? Surely, His Majesty Rimuru would want to join the council? And with that being the case, the answer should be settled."

The one who shouted this was Count Gavan. With Gavan's support, Johann kept on speaking.

"Councilor Gavan has a point. This is no time for us to argue now that we are facing the threat from the east. If Demon Lord Rimuru were to join the council, his military force, surely, would be at our aid."

"Oh, oh-oh..."

"That does seem to be the case..."

After hearing Johann's statement, the crowd began to gradually agree with his sentiment.

This seemed to cheer him up greatly. Johann added: "I believe that we should allow the Tempest Federation to join."

Johann announced this conclusion solemnly, saying it in a tone almost as if testing everyone's reaction.

This line alone was enough to change the atmosphere of the council.

Some people were afraid of the mysterious demon lord, but now they were reminded of the actual threat that was the Eastern Empire. Even though Tempest was a kingdom of monsters, it was still a negotiable partner where human common sense prevailed.

On the other hand, the Empire was the greedy enemy attempting to devour all. It was because they were all humans, that the people foresaw the inevitable failure and fate of being vassalized, were they to fight against the Empire.

The ruling class would all be killed---that's most likely what awaited them.

The Empire was an enormous military nation. Reviewing its history, they had swallowed up countless nations and prospered off of it. They have never shown mercy to their oppositions, that was why the Western Nations were all afraid of them.

"Umm, councilor Johann has a point. I agree with his view."

"Oh oh, so you understand my concern, councilor Gavan! I believe there are others out there who also agree with my view. That's why I hope to initiate a vote to see if we should allow the Tempest Federation to join. What are all of your thoughts on the matter?"

"Very well. First us Western Nations must unite."

"Indeed. Now is not the time for us to fight amongst ourselves!"

Several senators voiced their approval for Johann's proposition. Now that things were heading in the intended direction, the speaker of the council shouted: "Silence!"

As the speaker passed the motion, everyone began to vote.

First, they riled up people's fear, then they pressured them with their common alliance. That really did seem like methods that noblemen would use, how clever.

*Could this be part of their plan? Speaking of which, it did take considerably long before they cut to the chase...*

It was obvious that Johann and Gavan were in on this together, and there were other people who were supporting their ploy as well. Hinata, as a by-stander to the situation, didn't have the right to vote. She calmly observed the meeting and discovered the truth of the matter.

All of this chaos was scripted, and now Hinata was inwardly relieved to know that it was finally over.

![break]

It had been eight hours since the start of the meeting. Even though there was an intermission to rest, the fatigue continued to accumulate, nonetheless. This was not only physical fatigue, but a mental one. That was why Hinata was tormented throughout the process.

*Speaking of which, they asked a bunch of boring questions. They could have just asked us to monitor Demon Lord Rimuru directly to keep him in check---*

At the end of the day, that was the reason why Hinata was summoned in the first place.

It may be different for people who knew Rimuru, but for those who didn't know him, they would only see Rimuru as a demon lord. They needed protection in case the demon lord would rampage after inviting him to this place. And with Hinata, who---supposedly---reached a draw with Rimuru, the councilors could rest assured.

It was simply the noble's way of dealing, to intentionally complicate things.

Much like how the Empire was seemingly stirring, but their intention was simply to generate fear. Perhaps they were really preparing something, but the act alone was purely demonstrative. After all, in order to invade the Western Nations, the Empire would first need to overcome a number of obstacles.

A few of them were the Great Jura Forest and the Armed Nation of Dwargon.

It might have been a different case had the Tempest Federation not allied with Dwargon, but considering the current circumstances, even the Empire would not dare to make a move without making proper preparations.

*They should have at least tried to prepare before Rimuru could become a demon lord. That way, Veldora wouldn't have gotten revived, either. The Empire had its chance to rule the world...*

Out of fear that they would break the seal on Veldora, the Empire dared not to make a move.

Even with Veldora's presence off the radar, they were still very cautious and didn't act on it.

And now, they no longer had a chance to do so.

Despite Rimuru and King Gazel's apparent attitudes on the matter, surely, they both were on high alert against the Empire. But to Hinata, even if the Empire were to make a move, they would pose no threat.

Both the councilors, Johann and Gavan believed so. They drew the small nation's councilors' attention to the external threats while secretly fortifying their own authority within the council. Their noble-like attitudes in doing things truly annoyed Hinata.

The result of the poll, naturally, showed a majority support towards the motion, agreeing to allow Tempest to join the council.

"Then, we approve for the Jura-Tempest Federation to become our ally and shall send an invitation letter. After confirming with Demon Lord Rimuru about the will of the council, we shall hold a second conference. That is all!" the speaker announced solemnly, concluding the meeting.

*Never again, I will never get involved in noble affairs*---Hinata vowed to herself.

![soft scene break]

After the extremely exhausting meeting, Hinata planned to return to the church.

However, her suffering for the day didn't seem to end there.

"Hinata-san, a moment of your time please."

Hinata was stopped by someone; a man surrounded by around ten bodyguards. He looked rather young, had clean-cut blonde hair and a bright smile. An extraordinarily handsome man, but not to Hinata's taste.

Her patience was already exhausted by the eight hours of misery she had endured. She just wanted to go back. Since Hinata had no interest in this man at all, his smile was pointless to her.

With that being said---this man's standing was a problem. The headquarters of the council were set in the Kingdom of Ingracia, and he was the first prince of Ingracia, Elric. Being rude to him would probably lead to a diplomatic incident. Therefore, from Hinata's perspective, she couldn't simply ignore him.

"What is it? Did you need me for something?"

Hinata socialized to the best of her ability and returned the question to Prince Elric, who wore his pretentious smile a moment longer before answering.

"The thing is, Hinata-san, I have a request for you."

Speaking of which, they were not close enough for Elric to call her '-san,' even though this was a man of high standing. She knew his face and had heard of his name, but that's all there was to it.

This was also the first time that Elric conversed with her. The fact that he acted close to her made Hinata feel very unpleasant.

"What is your request for me then?" Hinata asked after the two of them moved to the reception room.

"During the next meeting, I intend to sound Demon Lord Rimuru out. Only the higher-ups know about this. That said, surely the commoners would still be deeply distressed to learn that a demon lord is joining the council. We have to let the demon lord take on a level of responsibility, and I wish to confirm how much of our words he would be willing to listen to. That's why I hope you would help me out."

Elric gave another bright smile as he finished.

To Hinata, this was just plain annoying right now.

"And I would help out with what exactly?"

Almost as if saying "Get to the point," Hinata hurried Elric.

"---Uhh!"

Elric was expecting her to show more willingness to help, yet Hinata's lack of interest was certainly unexpected. Still, he managed to pretend as if the situation was under his control and began to explain.

"W-well, allow me to explain. Even though we only intend to test the waters with him, this is still the demon lord we are talking about here. It would be problematic if he were to lose control. That's why we hope you would act as our bodyguard."

As the first prince, people had always bowed to his demands. This was something natural to Elric. He knew he was very handsome as well, so he thought that no woman in this world would reject his request. Elric had no doubt that Hinata would also agree. It was only natural for her to be Elric's bodyguard and stand by his side to observe as the matter transpired.

But all Hinata felt was confusion.

Naturally, Hinata had no reason to accept the request.

*Does he seriously expect me to agree with that kind of attitude?*

With that thought in mind, she couldn't help but ask, "Why me though?"

"Why? Obviously because we approve of your strength. You are the strongest commander of the Holy Knight Order in generations, the right hand of God, the 'Head Knight of the Pope's Imperial Regiment'; we truly recognize your strength! In the Western Nations, no one can match up against you. I heard that you even managed to square off with Demon Lord Rimuru. With someone as strong as you by our side, we can provoke Demon Lord Rimuru to show his true colors, while also ensuring our personal safety!"

After praising Hinata at length, Elric expressed his "two-cents" confidently.

*What is this guy on about*---Hinata thought to herself.

Although Rimuru may seem very chill at times, he was still a real demon lord. Provoking him like that out of the blue would be a most foolish act. Moreover, the rumor that they reached a draw was deliberately spread. Hinata couldn't win against Rimuru. If Rimuru were to become seriously enraged, the only person that could possibly stop him would be Luminas, who was also a demon lord.

"I suggest you dismiss that thought this instant. That person is really strong, I can't guarantee that I would win if we were to fight again."

"Seriously, you are being too modest. You don't have to act like some gentle cutesy gal in front of me."

Hinata's smile disappeared completely after his comment. Elric's narcissistic remark genuinely annoyed her. While Hinata hadn't exhibited any physical change, the man in charge of protecting Elric suddenly stepped in.

This large man stood out from the crowd with his lofty attitude. His name was Reiner, the knight commander of the Kingdom of Ingracia. Reiner's reckless attitude had touched Hinata's nerve.

"Hahaha, Hinata-dono, no one will blame you for falling in love with Elric-sama, but now is not the time for that. The prince already has *me* as his bodyguard, so there's no need to worry. Though, with your help we would be able to ensure absolute safety, so---"

Hinata didn't have the patience to hear the end of this mockery.

"I refuse. The Western Holy Church, as well as the Holy Empire of Lubelius, have signed a nonaggression pact with the Tempest Federation. And also, a bit of advice for you...don't piss off Demon Lord Rimuru."

"---What did you say?"

"Y-you dare to give *me* an order!"

Neither of them expected her to refuse. Elric and his bodyguards all fell silent upon hearing this.

Hinata had no desire to interact with these two any longer.

If this had been a reasonable and formal request, Hinata probably couldn't have refused. It would be the right choice for the council to find someone like Hinata who was specialized in dealing with monsters.

Since the council had such an important role to play, they would probably file an official request through different branches of the Western Holy Church. Considering the future standing with the Western Nations, Hinata couldn't simply reject the matter purely because of her mood.

*If that had been the case, it would've been a hassle in the future,* Hinata thought to herself.

Nevertheless, in that case, the detailed conditions would have been negotiated, and Hinata would have managed to refuse any clear hostilities on the grounds that they violated the treaty.

Elric and his men wanted to skip that part of the discussion, that's why they came to talk with Hinata directly... But things didn't exactly go in their favor.

"You will regret this, Hinata-dono! Reiner-sama is the high commander of the Ingracia Knight Order. Are you really planning to be an enemy to him?"

"That's right! For the human race, you cannot allow the demon lord to do whatever he pleases. Wouldn't the church want to prevent him from running amok during a council meeting?!"

Their lackeys began to shout, which reassured Hinata in a way. Because she could tell from this, that the whole ordeal was impulsively arranged by a group of people without much consideration.

"How unfortunate, but personally, I trust Demon Lord Rimuru. So long now."

Thankfully she was dealing with idiots here, Hinata thought to herself as she walked away.

Hinata had shown the bare minimum level of civility, hopefully it wouldn't develop into a diplomatic issue. Keep in mind that it was not polite to negotiate with Hinata, who had been invited to the council meeting, without informing her in advance.

Considering this was the prince of a large nation, Hinata's response, while not perfect, was passable.

However---

*These idiots, are they really going to play some tricks to provoke Rimuru...*

A sense of unease crossed Hinata's mind.

As she just made up her mind to not get involved with noblemen again, she ran into such an ordeal.

*I didn't join their plan, hopefully they can regain their cool...*

They would need to mobilize the army in order to deal with the demon lord. If they wanted to rely on a smaller number of people, they would need to gather some reputable champions. They wouldn't have the time to prepare for that.

Having summoned the demon lord to their own domain could have been a wonderful opportunity. But if all they wanted to do was to play along as things progressed, the chances of success for their plan were pretty showing.

But perhaps---

All of this was planned from the start?

*That seems impossible. However, I should probably be cautious next time---*

On that closing thought, Hinata felt a sense of distress.

![hard scene break]
I had accepted the invitation from the Council to come to the kingdom of Ingracia. I seemed to have been considered as a guest of honor, seeing that they prepared the most luxurious hotel for us. It would probably be fun to take a tour of the capital city that I had missed so much.

Benimaru, acting as my bodyguard, didn't dare to be careless.

There was also Souei receiving reports from the shadows.

Speaking of shadows, I felt pretty lonely without Ranga chilling in my shadow. He needed to find Gobta on occasion. Gobta had been utterly exhausted from his training with Milim. Even though he had recovered at this point, he didn't seem to have time to rest his body, since Milim had told him that he would be examined regularly. To be specific, he would be tested in the form of a mock-battle with Karion...

Gobta cried to Ranga before that he would be killed one day if this were to continue. Ranga, who did not know how to deal with Gobta, went away to get him. But his tail was wagging pretty wildly back then... While he did complain a lot about him, Ranga must've really had a soft spot for Gobta.

It's great that they were so close.

And so, I brought Benimaru and Shuna. Having too many people would be problematic anyway, so having as few companions as possible would instead be better.

I wanted to bring Shion, but taking her to a large city like this would be concerning. It was going to be troublesome If she were to behave as she usually did. That's why I ordered her to look after our HQ while training her subordinates.

Geld was the commanding officer of the construction project taking place in Milim's new capital and couldn't leave.

Diablo was still out there drifting about. He said he was going to find some people as his subordinates. *Did things go wrong or something?*

As for me, I'd managed to create the containers that I promised him. I hoped to get it done before he returns, so he could take his time coming back. But to be honest, Diablo would probably get back the moment I called him. I didn't have any urgent errands to run, so it wouldn't hurt if I just allowed him to do what he wanted.

Momiji had taken Hakurou to visit the hidden tengu village.

Gabil and Midley went to visit the City of the Forgotten Dragon. They heard that it was a habitat for wyverns, so they decided to tame some. Gabil had always wanted to improve the abilities of the Hiryuu, and as part of that plan, he apparently considered incorporating wyverns to create an airborne cavalry.

He had spent countless days researching lately, making it easy to forget that he was also an outstanding warrior trusted by his subordinates. Hopefully his test would go well. I was looking forward to the results. I'd reward him once he succeeded.

Just like that, my lieutenants had been hard at work.

This was why only the three of us were visiting Ingracia. We would be meeting up with Souei once we arrived.

![break]

The first place we visited was the clothing store.

Just like in modern Japan, there were all sorts of clothes on display inside glass cabinets and some passersby viewed the items as they walked past. It was a testament to how urban the capital of Ingracia was.

These windows were all insanely expensive. Despite glass wares being commonplace on the market, buying a single glass pane of this size would set you back as much as a run-down house. And given how the stores used them for their displays, it was a clear sign that their businesses were very profitable.

This was what Myourmiles taught me, though I could easily confirm such an idea from the number of customers alone.

By the way, our nation also adopted window displays. After I told everyone what I saw in the Kingdom of Ingracia, Shuna and the other female members begged me to import them. I couldn't come up with a reason to refuse them, so I talked to Mildo and had him handle the production of the glass. With the amazing assistance from Wisdom King Raphael-sensei, the production of the display windows came into fruition smoothly.

Putting that aside, the reason why we came here first was due to Shuna's demands. Propped up in the window displays were the latest fashion trends. She was observing them with great interest.

They truly were gorgeous.

We perused all kinds of shops and found many clothes with special designs that our nation didn't have. The clothes made by Shuna and the others were mostly based on my personal memories. But the place here was full of clothes designed by the artisans themselves. The items all had their own charms.

They were enough to have completely mesmerized Shuna.

"I'm not gonna be defeated like this, I will refine my skill even more---!" Shuna muttered, filled with determination.

"I'll be counting on you in the future! Then, everyone, please help yourself to any clothes of your liking. I'll pay."

"Eh! R-really?"

"I can choose as well?"

"...I'm fine with my outfit."

"Don't be so formal now! I haven't been paying you guys any salary. At least allow me to treat you in times like this."

As a token of appreciation for the care they had given me every day, I decided to buy them some clothes. Even though we had specially prepared suits for tomorrow's meeting, Benimaru and Souei would still be wearing their combat outfits. Adventurers would be on site during the meeting as well, so they couldn't really be blamed for their attire. But their outfits were still too eye-catching for wandering in the street. Shuna was also wearing her miko outfit, to which I had no issue if she were to have another pretty casual outfit.

Which was why I told everyone to pick their clothes.

Benimaru and Souei picked two sets of tailor-made jackets and shirts, with skinny jeans to go along with it.

*Very naisu, very naisu. It's a great fit for their style.*

*On the other hand, Shuna---OH OH!*

She picked a soft white pantskirt with an icy-blue knitted vest.

How cute, it suited her perfectly!

"This looks great, it suits you perfectly, Shuna!"

"Thank you for your compliment! I'm so happy, Rimuru-sama."

*Mm-hmm.*

Seriously, while her miko outfit was amazing, this type of casual outfit looked great as well. It was rare to see her dressed this way, so it was very refreshing. This was a rare opportunity, so I had her choose a couple different outfits and bought all of them. Surely, she would be able to tailor more clothes based on these outfits.

I also chose a pale-blue jumpsuit as a gift for Shion. That gal looked like an ice-cold beauty from the outside, I'm sure she will be able to wear this outfit to its fullest.

"She will definitely be overjoyed!"

"Will she now?"

Then I'm happy as well.

"Yes, definitely."

Surely, it would be the case if even Shuna said so.

"You two looked great in your outfits as well, let's buy all of them."

"Don't have any more words to spare on us?"

"---Indeed."

Benimaru and Souei seemed to complain, but I ignored them.

*Are you two implying that you want to choose more?*

Their tone gave the impression that they were completely disinterested, yet they still scoured the selection of clothes with great enthusiasm. Handsome people look good in any clothes, so there's really no need for you guys to worry.

I, on the other hand, came to a quick decision. I couldn't tell the difference between good and bad clothes no matter how much I worried about it, so I asked the staff of the shop to help pick out clothes for me. Their choices would be undoubtedly reliable.

And so, we each picked out our clothes. The size measurements were done on the spot, and we changed into our new clothes immediately.

Shuna had a big smile on her face as she held the bag of clothes I bought her like a treasure. Unlike my secretary-in-name Shion, Shuna always worked very hard. To see this different side of her did bring a smile to my face.

Benimaru and Souei also seemed happy after changing into their new clothes.

Everyone looked happy about this, how wonderful.

These people had always been hard at work, I wanted to reward them to show my appreciation. Seeing how overjoyed they all were, perhaps I should have come here sooner.

On that note, I paid the bill.

![break]

After changing our outfits, we visited the cafe run by Yoshida-san. Nowadays, the cafe was run by his disciple. Business was very good. Since the ingredients they used were exported from our nation, we could buy the products they sold at a discounted price.

We were waiting for Hinata, who was also coming to Ingracia. Apart from the lunch I was looking forward to enjoying in Ingracia, Hinata would also brief us in detail about the meeting being held tomorrow.

During that period, I acquired some of Souei's information. Souei had been keeping tabs on what was going on in the Western Nations, so I thought he might know about the reason we were invited this time.

"Then, Souei, I'll trouble you to do the report."

"Very well. Then I shall start with the feedback on the nation-founding festival---"

As he finished, Souei began to report the important bits of information from the local rumors and gossip.

The report was easily understood, and I was very satisfied.

The feedback on the founding festival had been glowing. From noblemen to common peasants, everyone was talking about it.

Speaking of rumors, the dungeon was mentioned frequently as well. The promotion we did towards the nobles worked like a charm. I heard that some were even forming teams of participants to challenge the labyrinth. Not only was this the case for residents near our nation, even in distant kingdoms, the interest was growing.

At this rate, the number of challengers would keep climbing.

And with that, after finishing the more enjoyable topic, we decided to discuss the more important matter.

"Then, tell us about the result of the investigations on those merchants, as well as the connections Duke Muze had behind him?"

"I've investigated them all, ran a thorough search on the family members and the trade partners of the merchants. The results show that they have not been in contact with any suspicious individuals of late. However, they did seem to share common benefactors when they were applying for the business license. After doing some research on the officers who helped these merchants, we discovered that they were all connected to Duke Muze."

*...And, what does that mean?*

<<Answer. The merchants were all acting according to the will of the individual "Muze.">>

I see. So no more important information would be revealed even if we were to continue investigating these merchants.

*But what about Muze?*

Perhaps there really was a shadow committee running the Western Nations. There was a possibility that they were planning for something. Muze seemed like a competent individual, we should probably continue surveilling the person.

"So, I've heard that Duke Muze's a cunning one, what happened to this pesky guy?"

No matter how cunning he was, he couldn't run from Souei's watchful eye. If he were to come in contact with any suspicious organization or tried to pull something, we could probably catch their tail and turn it against them.

But just as I was thinking about it, Souei spilled a shocking fact.

"He's dead."

"Ah?"

"I suspect the cause of death was a ranged attack."

Muze was the duke of the Kingdom of Guston and a man of high social standing. To be so daring as to kill Muze with such authority, this really made one doubt whether this had to do with some secret organization or not.

Moreover, if they really went to such lengths to cover their tracks, our opponent must've held tremendous power.

<<Answer. It is estimated that they discovered that individual 'Souei' was tracking Muze.>>

*He was murdered to silence him, huh?*

Then we needed to treat the matter more seriously. Our opponent was no easy foe to tackle.

"Even you did not notice?" Benimaru questioned, which was met with Souei's calm answer, "Yes. Until Muze fell before my very eyes, I did not sense the slightest thing."

It seemed that the only sound made during the event was Muze dropping to the ground. Even Souei did not see it coming. Seeing him reporting in an almost apologetic tone, I could only comfort him.

"Unbelievable. If Souei didn't sense anything, the assassin must have attacked from several hundred meters away. If it really was magic, surely, you would've been able to sense mana, and if it was some projectile weapon, surely, there would've been remnants of youki as well?"

*No, it couldn't have been that simple.*

*With Raphael-san's aid, I can sense most things with 'Magic Perception'...*

*But in this case---*

"It sounds like a sniper attack."

"Sniper?"

"What is that?"

I see, so Benimaru didn't know.

Shuna also looked at me with confusion. Come to think of it, there weren't any firearms in this world, however, if it were to be an 'Otherworlder,' you couldn't dismiss that possibility.

"You mean guns? I recall that Yuuki owns a pistol."

"WAH!"

I almost fell off my chair as someone suddenly spoke behind me.

It was Hinata.

That gave me a good scare. She hid her aura before approaching me without a sound. Benimaru smiled, Souei also covered his mouth, seemingly to conceal his grin.

That was super embarrassing!

"Onii-sama! And Souei too!"

Shuna scolded them both on my behalf, so I didn't voice my complaint.

But then again, Raphael-san should've reported to me in the first place---

<<Report. The individual approaching bore no ill will.>>

*...I figured as much.*

It was all because I tried too hard playing it cool. While thinking "Can't help it with these guys," I passed off the awkward moment with a wry smile.

![soft scene break]

Since Hinata had come, we began to order our lunch.

One silver coin was enough to get us a super luxurious meal. Mealtime is no time for business talk. We enjoyed the delicacies to our heart's content.

After filling my tummy, I ordered a cup of coffee. The bitterness of coffee really is the most suitable for adults. With a bunch of sugar and milk added, the bitterness and sweetness started to tango---

"Isn't this just café au lait^[French: hot milk coffee]? How is it adult-like to drink something that sweet; at least order an espresso."

A sharp point came flying from Hinata.

*Looks like I accidentally spoke my mind.*

"S-shush already! This is nothing really, I'm just drinking for the occasion!"

"Hmph, by the way, your outfit is tasteless for an adult, as well."

Uhh, not only coffee, even my clothes were dissed.

Were her words true?

What the staff had chosen for me back at the shop was a stylish poncho-like clothing. Even though it did seem a bit childish, I thought that I should be confident in the staff's taste...

And I thought "their choices would be undoubtedly reliable."

"Damnit, is this outfit really for children?"

"No, no, no, it suits you really well, Rimuru-sama!"

"Y-yeah, it looks really good."

"But, I thought this is the type of clothes you like."

*You saying that it suits me, does it mean that you think I am childish?*

*How should I put this; I feel hurt.*

This outfit was very comfortable and I didn't really dislike it. But speaking of which, that was not the point. The thing was my dandy-like appearance now...

Thankfully I had grown a bit taller now. I started to look like a middle school student.

"Cuteness is really your style, just give up and roll with it," Hinata concluded, to which I felt very frustrated.

![break]

Right.

The way I looked right now, I couldn't suggest the slightest bit of mature charm. I didn't understand why I was concerned about my height now, even though I used to be an adult. Perhaps I should just come to terms with reality.

By the way, Hinata hadn't dressed up beautifully like during the festival. She was wearing her holy knight outfit, going the route of the cross-dressing beauty. She looked quite dignified.

---*Well, shouldn't I switch places with Hinata?*

Whatever the case, I wasn't bold enough to say that out loud. Although I felt it was very difficult to let go of the matter, we went back to our previous topic.

![break]

While mourning the loss of Duke Muze, we began to investigate the circumstances of his murder.

"You mentioned that there are pistols in this world, so was he really killed by a sniper?"

"I'm not sure about the details regarding that, but a pistol doesn't even have an effective range of fifty meters, right?"

That seemed to be the case.

Surely, one would need a rifle in order to launch such a long-distance attack.

"Are there sniper rifles in this world then?"

"Beats me, I've never seen one, but I can't conclude that there aren't any."

I suppose.

It was best to assume that sniper rifles existed in this world and act accordingly. And so, I transferred the concept of firearms through 'Telepathy Net' to Benimaru and the others.

"Oh, so there's this type of weapon."

"I see, if this was utilized, I naturally would not have noticed."

"Perhaps I can use this as well. It shouldn't be a problem to research gunpowder, and the gun itself can be made by Dold-san."

I got three different responses from three different people.

In Benimaru's view, this type of weapon shouldn't even be considered as a threat.

But Souei feared a repeat of his last mission's failure, and the inability to ensure the safety of his target. For his type of missions, he seemed to consider guns a threat.

On the other side of this, we had Shuna. Her idea was to make the most dangerous gun... We could indeed make one, but what would be the consequences of doing so?

The production of firearms marked a dramatic shift in the way that wars were fought---that being said, this world adhered to quality over quantity in a lot of cases when it came to strategic design. Still, adding guns to our arsenal seemed very dangerous, we were better off not developing them just yet.

"In any case, in another world, this weapon's ferocity granted enough power to allow normally fragile people to dominate those around them. While I don't know how useful it will be in this world, it should be effective against magical beasts and the like of them."

"A gun can run out of ammo, but not mana. The higher the caliber, the more powerful the guns are, and the greater the number, the more threatening it is. For these reasons, I hope that your nation will not mass produce them."

*Indeed, it's definitely viable.*

Hinata had thrown in her two cents.

"Right, we'll see about it. I think magic is stronger, but an average person wielding a firearm is equally dangerous."

Japan did not have a gun society, therefore such a feeling was even stronger for me. Unlike what foreign news claimed about being able to protect yourself by owning a gun, I believed that such incidents probably wouldn't happen if no one owned guns anyway. Upon thinking so, it indeed felt very dangerous to spread such dangerous weapons to everyone.

"Okay, then I shall keep it strictly as research."

Shuna accepted that, which was reassuring.

However, even though it was generally considered as a threat, it shouldn't be able to harm us at all. Did we really need to give it such high regard?

<<Report. To individuals with insufficient amounts of information, if they were to witness someone being gunned down in front of them, they wouldn't understand what happened. It is highly likely that the people around the deceased would be considered suspects.>>

Hmm?

Raphael-san suddenly advised me, but what did that mean? *The people around the deceased would be considered suspects*---oh, I get it! It meant that if someone next to me were to be assassinated, people would start to suspect me.

After hearing so, it was indeed the case.

Since Hinata was already close to me, even her testimony would likely be rejected. If the criminal ran away without leaving behind any murder weapon, I would likely be the one held accountable.

How dangerous.

Had I not discussed this with someone beforehand, I would have fallen for it. Even though I was not sure whether our enemies had truly set up such a trap or not, if Raphael-san deemed it necessary to warn me about it, I'd just assume they have.

"Anyway, we best be careful during tomorrow's meeting."

"Wouldn't we just feel a pinch after being hit by a lead bullet without mana? We shouldn't be so careful about it."

"No, that's not discreet enough. Just as Hinata has said, the larger the caliber, the stronger the attack. There may even be something like a magic bullet. Moreover, if someone gets hit by one during the middle of the meeting, I will probably be the number one suspect."

"I'm worried about that too. I will be deploying my 'Clones' around the meeting ground and be extra careful."

As expected of Souei, he already thought of so without me bringing it up.

"Umm, I'll be counting on you!"

"Yes sir."

In other words, should any suspicious individual appear, Souei would figure out a solution.

![break]

Now that I had been reassured, it was time to get to the main issue.

"By the way, Hinata, why did they invite me this time?"

I still hadn't been informed what we would be discussing in tomorrow's meeting. But I could predict it.

Perhaps it would be about a certain dragon running loose somewhere, or the sighting of a mysterious demon lord---Ramiris and Veldora's predictions were absolutely idiotic. That couldn't have been the reason. The topic of the meeting had to be about whether or not they should allow our nation to join the council.

It appeared that we would be treated as the nation's guest this time. I looked forward to good news at the meeting.

"During the last temporary meeting, they agreed to let the Tempest Federation join the council. During tomorrow's meeting, they plan to question you first before making the official verdict."

Bingo!

Those two idiots were mostly oblivious of the situation and made nonsense predictions. It was correct of me to have ignored them.

"I see, as expected," I nodded, pretending that I had been aware of the situation the whole time. Hinata looked at me somewhat doubtfully.

<<Report. Based on the current situation, the only possible explanation is that individual 'Hinata Sakaguchi' seems to be saying "How very astute of you.">>

What---!

T-then wouldn't my smug look just now have made me look like an idiot?

Regardless, since Hinata explained the proceeding, I couldn't help but imagine what they would ask.

The council would probably ask about the magitrain, or perhaps to purchase the weapons displayed by Kurobee before, or even want us to showcase our research results. Now that I'd thought up all these different potential explanations for their summoning me, it was troubling.

However, Raphael-san said that it couldn't think of any other reason. If that were the case, I would have preferred it to tell me from the beginning.

I coughed dryly before taking a sip of coffee.

Hopefully I could fool her with this...

"Never mind. Right now, you still aren't officially acknowledged, so don't get careless. You are a demon lord. I figure that there will be questions that would anger you during the meeting but I trust that you won't fall for it?"

I was not sure if I managed to fool her, but Hinata didn't seem to care.

If I were to make a mess of this meeting, it would make her position troublesome, since the Holy Empire of Lubelius supported the Tempest Federation and would suffer as well.

She was worried that such a thing would happen and reminded me beforehand.

I was quite surprised. I was as temperate as Buddha. It was not that easy to piss me off.

"You are worrying too much for nothing. I'm not like you. I'm a mature adult who knows how to socialize with people."

"Huh? You want to fight or something? I'm game."

"Ah, no, that's not what I meant..."

See how easily she got pissed? That was the difference between Hinata and I. But it wasn't good for my health to keep poking this hornet nest, so I decided to keep quiet on that out of fear.

"Umm, I suppose. They are treating us like their national guests, which, to be honest, concerns me. I'm guessing that they have some requests in mind. Surely, Souei has found some information as well?"

"Yes. I have some intel. This includes the views of all nations' royalty as well as those of their subordinates..."

"Brief me in detail later on."

"Understood."

Not that I needed it, just Raphael-san.

"---However, there's something I wish to ask Hinata-dono."

"What is it?"

Oh? And just as I thought that things were about to settle, it seemed that Souei had his mind on something else.

He ordered his subordinates to travel around the continent to conduct all sorts of investigation. Apart from investigating the shadow committee that allegedly ruled the Western Nations, they were also collecting intelligence in other countries.

I'd gotten used to it at this point, to have Souei and the others investigate whenever I needed to know something. Because it was Souei on the job, surely, he must have heard some interesting rumors.

"There were plenty of ministers from different nations that wished to exploit our nation. Those people said that---"

"Let me guess---they want you guys to become a part of the defensive network against the Eastern Empire?"

"How impressive, that's exactly the case, Hinata-dono."

Hinata gave the correct answer before Souei even finished. In other words, Hinata knew full well about the situation.

"Do you mean that they wish for our aid with an upcoming war? Even so, aren't we only obligated to help fortify Blumund?"

Benimaru also analyzed the situation by himself and teased Souei for worrying too much. Benimaru had a point as well, but the problem actually lied in the lead-up to the war.

Hinata had probably predicted how things would develop in the future. And since she didn't seem concerned at all, it meant that her conclusion was the same as mine.

I fully relied on Raphael-san's prediction, as it had very high credibility. And with Hinata's prediction aligning with ours, that's most likely how things would develop.

In order to prove that, I needed to verify it now.

"Benimaru has a point, we have only signed treaties with the Kingdom of Blumund. But before that, I don't think we need to worry about going to war with the Empire."

"Could you tell me the reason?" Souei asked me, looking very concerned.

![break]

This guy was, as usual, serious when it came to work. To reassure Souei, I decided to give him the conclusion deduced by Raphael.

"Hmm, first of all, the most important thing is that we must think in the Empire's perspective. Assuming the Empire was to invade the Western Nations, what type of strategy would they employ---?"

Essentially, the key lay in the motive behind their invasion. But that was an issue for another time. If they were to go to war, the most important step was to choose how they would invade.

They would need to cross the Great Jura Forest.

Or cross the steep mountain roads of the Canaat Mountains.

Their last option was to take the sea route, which aligned with the old trade route we used before we constructed our roads.

While it also depended on the size and scale of the Empire's expedition army, either route would pose problems.

The sea route would be challenging. Distance-wise it could lead them to the Kingdom of Blumund. While it was safe traveling near the coast, if you went too far into deeper waters, you would run into the nests of large sea monsters that were over rank A. Even if they were to navigate through them with a large fleet of ships, safety could not be guaranteed.

Even the tasty spear tuna was extremely dangerous in the sea. It could travel and attack at a speed of sixty knots---equivalent of thirty meters per second. This monster could create giant holes in a ship.

Moreover, don't just think that you could ensure safety on a steel-armored ship. Because among the many giant sea monsters, the spear tuna was considered merely a third-rate monster.

A kraken might not be particularly intelligent, but it was rumored that their attack instincts against people invading their domain was very strong. If a ship were to be struck by its over ten meter long body, no battleship would be able to escape the fate of sinking.

Only traders who knew the sea route well would consider traveling by sea.

Then perhaps the mountain route would be preferable---but, near the Canaat Mountains, there was a hostile area called the den of dragons. If it were only a caravan, the dragons would probably close one eye. But if a large number of people were to approach, that would provoke the dragons. They were not humans, so it was impossible to negotiate. If the dragons thought that the visitors had harmful intent towards them, that would be their end.

The dragon clan were led by the prideful dragon lords. If the dragons decided to target them, the Eastern Empire's army would already be half-dead before they could start a war against the Western Nations. That was if they won, however. It'd be absolutely hilarious if they were to lose.

Moreover, after defeating the dragons, they would have to face the Western Nations themselves, which from there on would be the start of the actual war.

The military operation of traversing the steep mountains would give them hell already. And it will also depend on the time period. They could only pass during the short summer period. During wintertime, the mountains would be sealed by extreme weather and snow, which was difficult to overcome even with magic.

Normally speaking, the army would avoid marching in this route.

In the end, this left only the Great Jura Forest route to be viable.

But that wasn't very simple either.

"Now I, the Demon Lord, run the Great Jura Forest. Moreover, there's also Veldora."

"Indeed, we have circulated rumors that Veldora-sama has been revived. And now even the Empire would not dare to take a move without much consideration. They were already afraid of a sealed Veldora-sama, so they wouldn't begin to know what to do now."

Indeed, it was.

We had spread the rumors that the Farmus army was wiped out by Veldora. Surely, the Empire heard this news as well, and its ambitions would be set back as a result. After all, for the longest time, the Empire had always been afraid of Veldora. That was why they had acted with extreme caution. Had they acted sooner, we possibly would have been devastated already.

But now we had Veldora at our back, Raphael-san therefore could conclude confidently that there was no reason for concern.

<<Report. Not concluding, predicting. Situations change every day. With every additional piece of new information, new considerations will be added, and the situation must be reevaluated.>>

Raphael-san sure worried a lot. But it had a point.

If we were to rely on such biased views, we might find ourselves in a huge set up later.

"The Empire is indeed acting weird. Perhaps my 'Shadows' were not competent enough. I wanted to investigate myself, it's just that..."

Souei was busy investigating the internal affairs of the Western Nations. His subordinates 'Dark Shadow' had their own missions as well.

That was why he could only let the low tier monster^[Specific species category: Youma 妖魔; Author really likes throwing some Youkai, Youma around to confuse me...] called a 'Shadow' handle the matter. Although they were rank D monsters, they were capable of using 'Shadow Movement' and 'Telepathy Net.' It was the perfect monster for reconnaissance. Yet these monsters were unable to break through the 'Barrier' that protected the Empire.

Moreover, it would be difficult to dispatch more people on the matter. Given the fact that he was sending people to places with unknown threats for their mission, Souei could only entrust the task to people he approved of. If he were to withdraw these people from their current mission, it would go against my orders.

Souei was a competent man, but he wasn't omnipotent.

Even though Souei had evolved, he could only send out six 'Clones' at the same time. That was usually his trump card when dealing with dangerous jobs. He also needed some reserved as backups for unexpected situations. Souei was concerned that if he were to send out all of his clones to investigate the Empire, there wouldn't be enough forces protecting me.

"The Empire's intentions are really not that important. It's just that some councilors were exaggerating things in the hope that the council would agree to the addition of Tempest into the council. With that being said, since Souei-dono is so concerned about the matter, allow us to help investigate."

Oh, oh, it seemed that Hinata was just like Raphael-san. Neither would be too overconfident in their views. I knew she was very cautious, but to witness it with my own eyes truly made me respect her even more. I wished to learn from her and act more discreetly in the future.

Speaking of which, I didn't expect her to suggest helping investigate herself.

Then do indulge me---

<<Report. Please ask her to investigate the internal affairs of the Armed Nation of Dwargon, as well to confirm if military operation is possible in the underground capital.>>

---What a savage Raphael-san was, it even dared to use Hinata.

Nonetheless, its view was very logical.

There were roads that crossed the Dwarven Kingdom within the Canaat Mountains. And that would be right under Gazel's purview. While I doubted the Empire could really do anything there, I suppose I could ask Hinata to look into it.

"Hinata-san, then there's something else I wish to request."

"What is it?"

"Please investigate the structure of the Dwarven Kingdom as well."

"Dwarven Kingdom you say? That city was constructed out of the large caves at the bottom of the Canaat Mountains. I see... There is that possibility. I knew it, though you look like a careless fellow, you are actually very cautious."

"Aha-haha, right?"

"Got it. We will investigate the Dwarven Kingdom as well."

I was not sure what quality of mine Hinata was admiring, but this should do.

Although I felt like Raphael-san may be worrying too much, there was no such thing as absolute certainty in this world. Not long ago, I made up my mind about acting more cautiously, and if there were any potential threats, I would need to remove them quickly.

And since Hinata agreed to help, there was no need to hold back.

We discussed further in detail for a while.

![break]

That afternoon, at that cafe, we casually went on about important matters that could be considered national secrets, although we did apply a 'Sound Isolation Barrier' to mute our conversation from the outside. Which was why no one else would hear about our very important conversation.

In times like these, having a Skill like that was really convenient.

Hinata explained many other things to me later as well. It ranged from many topics, not just military. Many people seemed to be tempted to manipulate our nation. All in all, their human caution was very strong. I could relate to them however, given I was once a human myself. Which was why I agreed with Hinata's view.

"Got it? There are people plotting to take advantage of you guys, so don't fall for their trap."

To her words, I simply nodded in response.

But whether I actually took her advice was a different matter.

"What do you mean? Are we going to get manipulated?"

"Yes, perhaps in terms of the military. But regarding that, I actually agree, wouldn't it be in your interest as well?"

There would be conditions for joining the council. They seemed to want to toss us the job of managing everything in the Great Jura Forest. We'd also act as the buffer for defending against the Empire. That seemed to be every nation's wish.

"No problem. With the number of wild monsters decreasing, there will be more people coming to the labyrinth. That's just what we want."

"Don't be too idealistic. The order has seen first-hand how many scheming old foxes are in the council. They may order you to dispatch soldiers to their nations in order to suppress the threat of monsters."

Normally speaking, no one wanted a foreign army in their land. But with monsters being a thing in this world, they were the common enemies of all humans. Therefore, it was only natural for everyone to try and reserve sufficient military forces.

It was just like the Templar Knight Order of the Western Holy Church. Many nations would go so far as to employ other nations' armies.

<<Proposal. We can utilize this opportunity to offer them military force as a favor.>>

So not only could we have the council acknowledge us as a nation, but we could even send our army directly to other nations with proper justification? If that were the case, if any backlash were to ensue, we could use the military force to show them what's good.

My homeland Japan used to do this as well.

"Oh, oh, I see. Why not? Let them have it then."

"But it does kind of piss me off to know that they are exploiting us."

"But wouldn't that actually greatly increase our influence?"

I gave an evil grin, to which Benimaru and Souei immediately understood my meaning. Shuna smiled without saying anything. I suppose that meant that she agreed as well. There was no objection.

In other words, we'd act according to my will tomorrow.

"Your expression looked super evil just now." Hinata looked at me, almost dumbfounded.

![break]

She seemed to see through our thoughts. But she didn't say anything more. In other words, she approved. And so, our talk ended.

Before leaving, Hinata suddenly recalled something and said this: "By the way, there were a bunch of idiots who were up to no good. Don't you get careless now." It was a cautious reminder, telling me not to get angry and lose control.

![break]

The council was divided. She was probably telling me not to judge everyone by a glimpse of what I would see.

*Seriously. Why are you so worried about a pacifist like me?*

I knew what to do even if Hinata hadn't reminded me. My answer to her was, "You are worrying too much," then we bid farewell to her.

![soft scene break]

The night passed and the day of the conference was afoot.

We headed to the venue. It was Benimaru, Souei, Shuna and I. Everyone put on their respective outfits, all looking dashing. And of course, all of our weapons were stored in my 'Stomach.' On the surface, we would appear unarmed.

I had not the slightest sense of unease, having obtained much information from Hinata beforehand. Someone seemed to want to exploit our nation. But that wouldn't pose an issue for us joining the council.

If this allowed them to acknowledge us as a part of humanity, it would be one step closer to building the ideal society in my head. To form a relationship where both men and monsters can prosper and build a world on top of that. Quoting Myuran, it would be a circle of common prosperity for men and monsters.

On the monster side, we'd already established such a relationship among majins, dwarves, elves and many other races. This alone created a huge economic circle, but I was a human once myself, that's why I wanted to prosper along with humans.

However, humans were greedy. Unlike monsters, they cared too much about gains and losses and were naturally xenophobic. But at the same time, because of their greed, their standards of living had been raised as a result. That was an undeniable fact. They have also become the source of power that pushed forward the entertainment industry across the world.

Unlike monsters, humans weren't simple beings. Humans were complex.

I probably shouldn't have high hopes and expect that everything would go smoothly from the get-go.

![break]

When we arrived at the venue, a number of councilors had already been waiting for some time. They began to greet us. They all seemed to come from nations that neighbored ours. Or perhaps they had heard things from the participants of the founding festival, which prompted them to come and establish some friendly relations with us.

I was very happy to hear how they praised our men.

As I responded kindly to their proposals for the future, they seemed to be reassured and began to smile.

"Wahahaha, I've heard that Your Majesty Rimuru is a demon lord, I never imagined you were so easy-going!"

"Let us continue our friendship in the future!"

"You are all too kind, this is my wish as well. In the future we will be holding events once in a while, as well. For those who are interested, do come and join us."

During the festival, many people were still very afraid of us. But now they had warmed up and were willing to have discourse with us. This was all thanks to Rigurd, Myourmiles and the others' diligent efforts.

Because of this, I was cheered up greatly.

And even though Hinata warned me a ton beforehand, by the current look of this, there really wasn't any need for me to worry.

But just as I thought so, my mood was suddenly turned with the arrival of the next group of people.

"Hmph! You lot, stop troubling Rimuru-dono so much. Bunch of petty small nation scrubs with no real substance. What gave you the confidence to have spoken with him for so long?"

"Hah, that's right. What a rude bunch, Rimuru-dono might get the wrong impression of the council. Know your place and beat it already."

And just like that, a group of arrogant councilors showed up and chased away the people who were chatting with me.

*Who's the rude one!* I really wanted to say that, but I managed to hold myself back.

Souei had informed me via 'Telepathy Net' that the people who had just arrived had a rather powerful nation supporting them.

The council claimed that all councilors were equal, but it seemed that these people weren't exactly abiding by that rule. These people also saw their actions as justified, seemingly not feeling any guilt for their actions at all.

There was indeed a class difference as the result of their identities.

"Good day to you, Rimuru-dono, chatting with those people surely couldn't have been constructive."

"Good day to you too, what constructive topic were you referring to?"

While I didn't really want to talk with these people, I still decided to cooperate and give him some room to back off.

"My, my, don't beat around the bush now, how would Rimuru-dono understand if you put it that way!"

"Hahaha, you have a point. I see that Rimuru-dono is unfortunately devoid of noble etiquette. Then allow us to teach you in the future."

I merely replied out of courtesy, yet their responses had sounded really malicious. To be honest, these people's attitudes were way too natural, it's hard to tell if they really had ill intent or not. At the same time, they also seemed a bit too casual around me. I suppose it was better than them being afraid of me...right?

"By the way, Rimuru-dono, I heard that you were building some interesting things?"

"Indeed, I heard that you were developing something called a magitrain? We totally would approve if you would export this item to our nation!"

"Yes, that's our thought exactly. We can give you our aid, but of course, for a price---but it would seem inappropriate to continue."

Hmm, huh?

How should I put this; I was a bit astonished?

That was way beyond just 'rude'!

I was thinking that I should act with a bit of humility since these were nobles that I was dealing with. However, it seemed that I had miscalculated. They'd had a huge misunderstanding because of how I've handled this.

But this was their domain, after all. If I didn't play nice enough, things might turn problematic. I shall forgive them with my big heart. Since I'd promised Hinata with confidence, I couldn't get angry at this point.

"The magitrain can't be used without laying down the tracks first. Moreover, all of the construction plans have been pre-planned, so we can't exactly export them just because there are demands."

"Oh, never mind such details. I have already informed my home nation about it; all you need to do is to allow us to import the merchandise."

Looks like they hadn't even seen the actual thing and misunderstood.

They didn't even seem to know what a magitrain was, so our conversation had been completely pointless. Moreover, they were giving us demands one-sidedly without even considering our opinion.

But I still chose to endure this time.

"No, no, no! I've already told you, there are sequences to---"

I suppressed my inner rage and tried to refuse them, but these people didn't know when to stop with their demands.

"Then we wouldn't mind switching to a different merchandise. We would love to purchase a large quantity of weapons and armor, so please help us arrange it. And of course, don't forget to show some appreciation when the transaction is completed."

Among the noblemen, the man with a big beard representing the duchy of Laquia was especially annoying. He seemed to have even implied that we should bribe them. I seriously questioned whether he had forgotten the fact that I was a demon lord.

The nations neighboring the Great Jura Forest were subjected to the threats of monsters, while the nations located in the in-land of the continent enjoyed peace and prosperity. It must have been because of the riches of these nations that they didn't consider the demon lords a threat...

But I must say, these people were *really* annoying. The fact that I'd been trying to respond to them seriously made me look like an idiot.

"By the way, how did you educate that person called Myourmiles? My contact went to deal trades with him, yet he has been pending without any response. Is it possible to change the correspondent?"

*You are really, really annoying, you know?!* I really wanted to yell this at him.

So Myourmiles had been dealing with this type of people all this time. He must have had plenty of hardship hiding this behind my back. Even though he seemed to have handled them with ease, surely it was still very annoying to deal with.

I gotta learn more from him in the future.

"I will handle this properly."

Apart from saying so, I also gave them a smile.

Japanese was a very beautiful language.

Handle it properly---apart from what this line meant literally, there were no deadlines as to when the matter would be done. I never commented about how soon I'd handle the situation. It was the equivalent of me not promising anything.

This was a neat trick often used by the super elite---Japanese Bureaucrats. Now I could play dumb and make it through, as well as refuting this whole ordeal. What an excellent strategy.

"Oh, oh, that's certainly reassuring to hear!"

"We will be looking forward to it."

"Then, please allow us to excuse ourselves."

"Regarding the merchandise, we can provide you aid at any time, please feel free to ask."

"Looking forward to our future interactions."

Completely fooled by my words, those idiots left with satisfied smiles.

*Now that was a mature response.*

If you want to buy it, just come and buy it yourselves.

"Indeed, we will be in your care when that time comes."

I replied with some disingenuous lines and saw these councilors off.

What a troubling bunch.

There was no need to sell our goods to these guys, it was much more pragmatic to sell them through the Freedom Association. There were even more benefits, and the fact that the Association hadn't told us to bribe them was a definite win for us.

The other councilors began to close in on me, but I only greeted them briefly before leaving. Chatting too long with them may lead to some unnecessary trouble.

My mood had already been ruined this early into the morning. But I suppose that's an experience as well.

Had there been a problem before the meeting even started, there was no telling just how much Hinata would scold me afterward. It was best to just avoid all the squabble with them. We entered the venue soon after.

![soft scene break]

"Rimuru-sama, is it really okay to just let them go like this? Those arrogant bastards..." Benimaru asked me after we were seated following the council staff's guide. Seeing me endure the encounter just now, Benimaru seemed to have restrained himself as well. I was going to complain about it to him, but someone spoke before I could.

It was Souei and Shuna.

"Don't consider yourself to be on the same level as Rimuru-sama. Those were just taunting words of unimportant mobs, how could Rimuru-sama be troubled by them?"

"That's right, Onii-sama, Rimuru-sama's heart is broader than the widest sea. To think he would hold a grudge against insignificant characters like those would be most foolish."

Oh, oh, oh.

I suppose I could only play along now that I'd been praised like that.

"I suppose. Benimaru, you are still too naive to be pissed off by things as minor as these."

Even though I put it so nicely like that, I was still furious in heart. However, now that Shuna and Souei had misunderstood the situation and given a better explanation instead, I could only continue to push things in that direction.

I put on a pretense and lectured everyone. And so, some time passed by.

![break]

Some chairs were set up in the manner of a paper hand fan.

We were sitting on the seats meant originally for the speaker of the council. To put it simply, we were situated at the guard of the hand fan, where everyone could see us.

There was another table and an additional chair.

Benimaru and the others stood behind me awaiting orders.

The speaker of the council, who was hosting the event, was transferred to the safety of the second floor.

The so-called safety measure was meant to counter us. Since I was a demon lord, after all, people were still on guard against us. All the eyes of the councilors were now on us. It was rather uncomfortable sitting like this.

And so, the council conference began, but this was the start of the true hell.

Because I tried to play smart and made all the big claims, now I couldn't get angry even if my belly were filled with rage. I had to endure the entire thing, listening to the councilors speaking.

I'd asked Hinata beforehand about the content of the conference.

First let's look at the flow of the conference. The Tempest Federation wished to join the Western Council, and so the council listed a number of conditions.

We were to:

First: Abide by international law.

Second: Create an economic zone.

Third: Provide military force.

![break]

These were the three main conditions.

There was nothing wrong with the first condition. Regardless of the size of the nation in the council, there was a duty to abide by international law. With that being said, the council had no authority to actually interfere with the internal affairs of its member states, which was reassuring to know.

Every merchant was to abide by the trade laws of the nations they were trading in. If there were any problems, the matter would be settled according to the laws of the aforementioned nation.

If the merchants were dissatisfied about the verdict, they could file a complaint at the embassy of their home nations. There, it would be decided whether the issue would be elevated to a national level, or the merchants would just take the losses themselves.

It seemed that we had handled the incident during the nation founding festival pretty well.

If it were to develop into a problem on a cross-national level, it would be trialed according to international law. We would need to proceed to the international court to seek a verdict, and there would have to be a third-party nation at the scene---in other words, it would be a matter to be judged by the council.

The only councilors who didn't have a say in the issue were the ones from the nation in question. It didn't seem all too complicated. However, to be fair, we needed to publish our national laws first. That was the main issue, but I did have the reliable Raphael-san.

We had gathered information about the laws in different nations and had a perfect, easily understood outline to act as the foundation of our nation's law.

We presented this as well, so there shouldn't be any problems.

![break]

As for opening the economic circle, that was gonna be problematic.

The concept of a patent had yet to be introduced to this world. The current trend is that whoever could copy the design the best wins the race.

But it was too early to be worrying about something small like advancing the patent industry. If any civilization became too advanced, they would be attacked by the 'Army of Heaven.' As many as a million angels would attack from the sky, ransacking any towns on their way.

That's why the Western Nations didn't have electricity or gas. There weren't even steam-powered machines.

But did that mean everything in this world was inconvenient? That isn't necessarily the case as we had magic and magic items to compensate for the lack of technology. The level of fashion in this world could rival that of Japan, and even though there weren't too many fresh food ingredients circulating on the market, the techniques of preserving the food were excellent.

On the other hand, in terms of buildings, people seemed to utilize magic for some more advanced techniques than the modern world. It might not have been possible to create the castles and other impressive buildings using just modern techniques.

And so, people lived satisfied lives with an abundance of food, clothes and residences.

Living in the city was surprisingly comfortable.

If you had to point out where a problem was---

Vesta and Gabil's research publication, Kurobee's gear display, and the magitrain that even the bearded guy representing the Kingdom of Laquia knew about, had all been somewhat leaked at this point. It wouldn't even be a surprise if they knew about Youm and Myuran hiring a large labor force.

The problem was not with this information being known, but rather the fact that someone was trying to steal our technologies.

Correction, it's okay if they were just trying to steal it.

But these people were even worse, using the excuse of trading between nations to lay the tracks down in their nation first.

"You must lead the train to the duchy of Laquia first!"

"How can you make such a decision so rashly! Rimuru-dono, we at the Republic of Zamund are worthy as allies of the Tempest Federation."

"Silence! No one is asking the opinion of the nation's representatives; can't you see that His Majesty Rimuru is troubled by it now?!"

Had the white-bearded councilor not come out to mitigate, the meeting probably wouldn't have been able to continue.

It was all right for the market to expand, but I wasn't expecting to suddenly start providing new technologies to everyone. Moreover, if all of the nations were to treat us like a lackey and ask us to do every small favor for them, I had a bad feeling that they would call us for help constantly.

It turned out that my earlier worries were not for nothing. Even though, right now I felt quite frustrated, the conference needed to carry on.

![break]

About the last condition, which was to provide military force. I needed to consider that more carefully.

Hinata had already given me the advice, which was why I had re-examined the intelligence provided by Souei. Someone had tried to exploit our military force in the name of military assistance, which was why we wanted to take the opportunity to do the same.

Tempest would have full authority over the Great Jura Forest. They wanted us to act as a deterrent against monsters, which was fine. We were planning to do that anyway, which would be in our interests.

As a result of the meeting between Hinata and I, our nation would be in charge of defending the Great Jura Forest while the Holy Knight Order would defend the deserted land.

Our nation would be handling the expenses, so surely the council would be happy to see that. In order for economic activities to proceed smoothly, the world needed to be peaceful first.

There were several nations on guard against the Eastern Empire. To them, our nation's defense was like a lifeline to them. I must be worrying too much. If anything were to happen, our nation would be the one to take the first blow.

Based on these considerations, the third condition must be the council trying to exploit us.

We could actually use this to our advantage.

The big prerequisite was that we would handle the defense of the Great Jura Forest. Smaller nations also hoped for us to use our extra military reserve to defend their nations.

Even if the number of monsters near the Great Jura Forest had decreased, there may still be unexpected monster attacks. Some dangerous monsters could even fly from the air. So, a nation couldn't be picky when it came to the national defense budget.

You also needed to issue salaries for the patrolling soldiers. Clients had to pay for monster slaying to take place. If the council couldn't respond fast enough, they needed to make up the fee with tax-payer money.

Moreover, you could only issue contracts at the Freedom Association after discovering the monsters. So, you could never really be fully prepared.

The Western Holy Church only dispatched the Holy Knight Order to nations that recognized their religion of Luminism as their national religion. But they had limited knights, and the amount of area to patrol was very broad. Often, there weren't enough people when needed.

That's where we'd come in.

Each nation will pay us for our defense fee. We would be happy to oblige any request. At the same time, our nation will play a significant role in national defense. No kingdom would be able to ignore our nation.

In other words, we would be able to demonstrate our strength and influence on the Western Nations with our strong military backing.

We can make money while also expanding our influence.

That's a plan that can kill two birds with one stone.

Moreover, if the empire really invaded---

Should I call it fortunate or unfortunate? Tempest sat in the middle of the Empire's invasion route. We'd have to fight them regardless, so we might as well unite with the people standing behind us. It is exactly what we wanted---for them to be not afraid of us and willingly accept our defense force.

It would require an absolute difference in terms of strength to make this a reality. We would need to show them they have no chance of winning. Or else, it would be extremely foolish to hand their entire national defense to another nation.

*If we can't win by resisting, then we might as well use it*---if we can have everyone think that way, this tactic may actually work.

![break]

The councilors were either making demands or interrupting people now. It was then that the speaker announced that his explanation concluded.

"---These are the conditions for the inclusion of the Tempest Federation in the council. Your Majesty Rimuru, do you disagree with any of the items?"

Here, if you didn't state any objection, you were considered to have agreed.

I may ignore the views of every councilor here, but I wouldn't miss a single item on the list of conditions.

We wanted to exploit the council as well, so it'd be for nothing if we were to be bound by the treaty.

*Don't you normally draft these things in paper for us to ponder upon?*

---I was quite displeased by this.

What should we do if we couldn't give a response right after they demanded an answer?

I guess that this was their way of provoking us as well.

With that being said, I did have Raphael-san on hand. It would examine everything that was said in detail and use my hands to take notes. How omnipotent.

That's why I got to ponder upon all of the items and raise objections.

"I have reviewed every item in detail and have drafted doubts as well as alternative plans. If you are willing to accept, we won't have any problem either."

I handed over the written document to Benimaru, to which he stood up and passed it to the speaker.

The speaker was forced to accept it.

"---What?"

I mostly agreed to their conditions. However, in order to benefit from their attempts at exploiting me, I changed some of the content.

Raphael-san very kindly took a record of the revised draft.

Unlike just a mere verbal delivery, you could understand everything even after the whole ordeal. The speaker seemed to have looked down upon us because we were monsters. When he saw that his speech just now had been copied down in ink exactly as he had delivered, his face went pale instantly. Moreover, his expression practically said, 'Guess we can't get away with this one.' There were even revisions using red ink. No wonder why the speaker was so shocked.

But it's all thanks to Raphael-san, not me. Although I did need to act all smug for the occasion.

"Feel free to speak up if there's any problem."

If they don't accept the proposal we raised, we don't have to join the council. I would choose to give up deliberately. After all, there hadn't been enough time, and if the public wouldn't accept us, all we needed to do was to change our policies and only have in depth interactions with the nations that recognize us.

"No, there is no problem... But I hope you may give us some time to discuss Your Majesty Rimuru's proposal."

Looks like the speaker is no fool. He realized we were not easy to deal with.

But he raised no objections against our proposal, instead he decided to examine the document in detail.

Didn't you just deny us any time to ponder---even if I thought so, there was no benefit in us objecting now. So, I decided to accept his demand.

![soft scene break]

How did things turn out this way?

The table that was kicked into the air landed slowly. Time seemed to have frozen. Hinata was glaring at me, her eyes looked so cold.

*So you've finally done it*---even if she didn't spell it out for me, that line pinched my heart like a needle.

With a massive crack, the table hit the ground hard. I slammed the table with my heel, and it shattered into pieces.

No use crying over spilled milk.

I crossed my legs on the chair casually, acting as if everything was going according to my plan. I glared around at the councilors, whose faces had all turned pale, and sighed internally.

To be honest, I managed to hold it back at first.

People called me a mature adult and a role model for Tempest. I was proud of my open heart. You can tell from my behavior lately alone.

People said that I was the embodiment of patience and was even good at handling Milim. It's because of my open heart that I was able to endure Milim's stubbornness with a smile.

However...

What happens when a kindhearted slime gets crossed by a bunch of disgusting and horrible middle-aged men whose eyes glimmer with greed?

They get what they deserve, AKA a large table smashed in front of them.

There had been a three-hour intermission before the meeting resumed once more. It was then that problems emerged.

Regarding the files I mentioned, some councilors handed a bizarre document titled 'Petition' to me. Seeing how tired the speaker looked, this was not his idea. But I had no time to feel sorry for him.

As I skimmed the proposal, I realized most of the content in it was baffling.

The items were as follows:

One, the magitrain was to lead to the kingdom of Ingracia, while the construction fees needed to be paid by the Tempest Federation itself.

Two, the Tempest Federation was required to supply high-grade equipment that would be used to strengthen the military reserves of the Western Nations, as a show of support.

Three, the Tempest Federation's labyrinth was a treasure for all humankind, and thus, it was necessary for the council to oversee its execution and running.

Four, as the Tempest Federation joined the council, it needed to pay a set amount of taxes each year. Moreover, when it came to choosing a representative for Tempest, due to safety measures, only human candidates would be accepted.

And etc., etc.

They really went wild with their demands.

The rational side of me shattered within three seconds. These guys were truly impressive to have pissed me off in a mere three seconds.

Demands like these weren't worth more inspection. This was beyond an unfair treaty. If I were to sign such a treaty, I might as well give up on coexistence with humans.

"Ehh, fellows, are you looking down on me? I'll allow you to say whatever you want, but where did you get the impression that you can make demands of a demon lord?"

After kicking the table, I calmed down a bit.

I suppressed my anger and questioned the councilors with their heads low.

"Rimuru-sama is asking a question. Don't be so quiet now, please answer quickly," Shuna added on the assault with a smile, her words were even more effective than mine. All the councilors felt the immense pressure eating them alive and began to sweat.

"You all seem to have been mistaken. My nation is preparing to build a huge economic zone. But even so, I intend to join the Western Council. But this is for one reason---that is, we do not intend to antagonize humanity. But since you are clearly unwilling to cooperate, I don't suppose we should either---"

![full page image](image8)

The meeting hall fell silent with my words echoing.

Even though my voice wasn't that loud, it went straight into every councilor's heart and inspired fear.

I did not use my 'Demon Lord Haki,' since if I used it on humans, the luckier ones would only fall in a state of fear, but for the unlucky, they would probably go mad, or even die in pain like a maniac. That's why I won't use it in a place like this.

And of course, I won't brainwash them either.

It will ruin any prospect of us befriending humans. I don't want to deal with boring puppet-like companions who would only say YES.

Anyhow, at least I only destroyed the table in anger this time before expressing my opinion.

Yet this alone was tremendously effective.

"N-no, that wasn't our intent when raising those terms, Rimuru-dono..."

"I-indeed! We were only trying to build a bridge of friendship with your nation, it was just a careless mistake that we got a bit too presumptuous."

The councilors started to panic and tried to find excuses.

But I only got angrier as I listened.

By the way---

You are still calling me 'dono' even though I'm the ruler of a nation.

If you were the king or chancellor of a nation, then I suppose I could give it a pass. But if you were to call me that without actually leading a nation, it is the equivalent of looking down on our kingdom. It's almost as if they were talking to the king of their vassal states, there wasn't a shred of respect in their tone. These people were clearly looking down on us, thinking that we were just some monsters.

I can tolerate it if I get looked down on, but I cannot tolerate my nation being looked down upon. I'm a demon lord after all.

I was hoping that they would at least treat us in a manner worthy of such a title. But things were much more severe than I expected.

We stayed in the most luxurious hotel, and many councilors were polite to us, but that's what made me careless.

Even with all this playing a part, their attitudes overall were still horrible.

"Huh? Then what exactly was your motive? It sounds to me that you want to make the people of my nation your slaves and work them into the ground for your sake?"

"N-no! That's not the case at all!"

"We have no such intention! That's not our motive at all---"

The councilors tried their hardest to explain.

So, these were the kinds of nobles representing their nations. What a pain to deal with. Even someone with an open heart like me was approaching the limit of my patience dealing with them.

I imagine Yuuki must be one sly fox to have been able to play these stinky ocelots in his palm.^[What a confusing line for the English readers, apparently Fuse liked it so much he lifted it straight from the web novel. "こういう狸どもを手玉に取っていたのなら,ユウキはなかなかの狐だと言う事"]

I really want to learn from him, but I don't think I'd be able to manage.

<<Proposal. Allow me to handle the situation and engage automatic response? YES/NO.>>

Raphael-san seemed to have said something, or was I hearing things?

It is very outstanding, but a Skill is just a Skill, there's no way that it could have interjected freely like that. Maybe I'd relied on it too much every day, to be hallucinating its voice due to my wishes. If it were possible, it could even handle speech, then what the hell was all that I just suffered through?

I shook my head at such a ridiculous notion. And continued to glare at the councilors in front of me impatiently.

This was bad.

Now that I had regained my cool, I was troubled about how to salvage the situation. People always say that 'A hasty man is seldom out of trouble,' if anything were to go wrong here, it would be difficult to mend things.

The councilors were trying really hard, as was I.

<<Report. There is no problem. Just as master has thought, it has been confirmed that the whole venue was under the influence of mental interference.>>

*Huh? What did you just say?!*

I honestly wasn't thinking anything, not a single thought. I only acted because of my anger.

But---

<<Report. Mental manipulation has been discovered after collecting several samples. Similar to the individual 'Gai,' it appears that the majority of the councilors here have been psychologically influenced by someone. Interrupt interference? YES/NO.>>

*Ehh, do I really have to spell it out...*

I chose YES without hesitation. With that, the few councilors who had remained silent until now began to speak.

"Of course His Majesty Rimuru would be angered by this! This is an absolute disgrace on our side, how can we make it up to you---"

"Hold on, all of these terms were never mentioned prior to the meeting!"

"Who is it, who drafted this on their own?"

The situation suddenly changed.

Raphael-san sure was impressive, always so reliable.

"Fufu, looks like all the councilors have regained their reasoning."

I pretended as if I've seen through everything and mumbled rather pompously. I was just trying to play cool for a second, but Shuna reacted to it.

"I see how it is now! I was wondering why they were acting strange, could it have been some sort of mental interference?"

So, what happened exactly, Wisdom King Raphael-san?

<<Answer. It was a form of mental interference. The source of interference was not from magicules, so it took some time to decrypt it, but there aren't that many people with the same wavelength at the same time. This one thought it would take more time to deactivate it, but the wavelength of master's anger caused a 'tear' in it.>>

I see, so everything was within my expectation---I'll pretend that to be the case.

"Looks like the effect wasn't that strong. The mental interference was only strong enough to make some councilors short-sighted." I commented casually.

Fooled by my words, Shuna and the other two looked at me with newfound respect.

"I see, so is that why Rimuru-sama just pressured the councilors to plunge them into chaos?"

"That was indeed the case, Benimaru. All done with deep considerations."

Since I was afraid he would inherit the irritation of mine, I had to clarify first. It'd be great if I could explain this with Hinata as well.

I had enough time to take a breath at this point, but still I was confused, nonetheless.

Who was conducting the mental interference?

It was definitely not Yuuki.

Since it could have left evidence, I don't think he would have done it. If he were to risk leaving any possible trace, he would need a strong enough motive---to which I can't come up with one no matter how I think about it.

So, who was the one that orchestrated this incident?

This is no time to get to the bottom of that.

Right now, I had to resolve the problem at hand. Some of the councilors began to pressure those who regained their reasoning. It must have been these people who drafted the petition. The number was greater than I expected. Moreover, some of them still seemed very smug.

They have other tricks up their sleeves---that's the only explanation.

It was then that I felt something was wrong. Some of the councilors began to look towards the back door of the meeting hall.

I listened carefully and heard sounds of footsteps.

*Have they called for the guards?*

<<Report. There was no such activity detected. It has likely been a pre-planned event.>>

*Hmm. Looks like they planned to provoke me on purpose and then send in people to suppress me?*

They sure were confident---they were still fighting a demon lord, you know?

It was unbelievable how they decided to utilize such a flawed plan, but the residents that lived around Ingracia didn't seem to have enough sense of crisis. Perhaps it was because they lived too far away from the threat of monsters that these people had become too complacent.

The same went for these councilors, they were too happy-go-lucky.

Perhaps they were the "Idiots with ill intent" mentioned by Hinata...

When I realized this, the door happened to be open as a dozen soldiers and a large man walked inside.

![soft scene break]

"Oh oh, how very pretentious. So, you are the idiot who calls himself a demon lord? Are you really so arrogant as to only bring three servants?" The man yelled the moment he laid eyes on me. How unintelligent.

His laugh was pretty maniacal, completely looking down on me.

This was not something that could simply be described as just being rude. He was clearly here to cause trouble, there was no room for excuses. Even we were astonished to the point that we couldn't help but look at each other.

*No, hold up a minute. This must be the enemy's strategy.*

*How very cunning---*

<<Answer. This man likely does not have such capabilities.>>

*---Eh, seriously?*

*Then this guy's just a massive idiot---?*

"Ehh... I suppose I am the demon lord called Rimuru. Did you mistake me for someone else?"

*Just in case, yeah, just in case, I'll confirm with him.*

It'd be awkward if he said that he got the wrong guy, after all. Which was why I asked who he was looking for.

Shuna's smile gradually faded. Benimaru seemed to be frozen in anger. Souei was ready to take out his hidden weapon. This would be bad if things ended in bloodshed.

While I was angry as well, I could still make a joke out of the situation.

I managed to stay calm and began to talk to him, in an attempt to work things out.

In the end, it was a wasted effort.

"Yeah, it's you all right. I remember that the idiot's name was Rimuru."

So, he wasn't mistaken. That meant it was okay to kill him then...

"---Oi, you there, don't get ahead of yourself now! I don't know why you are doing this, but this is a public area with a bunch of eye-witnesses. You think you can break the laws here and get away with it scot-free?"

I decided to use the law as my shield and force this idiot away.

Then again, I wasn't exactly qualified to say something after destroying the table, but that was different.

Otherwise, I would've really killed him. And even if I managed to hold myself back, there was still the off chance that Benimaru would lose it.

However, this large man continued on his idiotic spiel.

"You fool! This is a great opportunity. I'll give you a hard time with this thing. With it, you monsters will give us whatever we want!"

Eh? What was he on about? Did he plan to give me a hard time and make me give them whatever they wanted?

What was this guy talking about? Was I just dumb? What was he trying to achieve? How come I couldn't understand him...?

<<Answer. This idiotic large man wishes to defeat master and make him answer to his commands.>>

*I know that already! You don't have to explain things seriously so often like I'm actually an idiot.*

By the way, the item the large man was holding, I'd seen that magic artifact before when Milim was pretending to be manipulated---the Domination Orb. It seemed to be the real deal, but the question was if it would actually work on me.

<<Answer. Domination Orb is ineffective in controlling master.>>

Glad to hear.

I wasn't sure where he got an item like that, but it was best to completely destroy something so dangerous.

With that thought, I stood up from my chair.

Confused at the sudden turn of events, the speaker seemed to regain his senses and began to shout in panic.

"P-please hold on, Your Majesty Rimuru! This must be some misunderstanding. This is by no means what the council intends to do, please confirm with the fair and a just third party of Hinata-sama first---!"

The speaker was respectful towards me, he wouldn't have lied.

Hinata never mentioned this to me, but she did advise me to keep my guard up. However, I didn't expect it to turn out this stupidly straight-forward. I suppose it was best to just go with the flow at this point.

The speaker wasn't my enemy, and neither was Hinata.

Moreover, some of the councilors were also on our side.

"We've never heard of this. What is going on here?"

"Who sent these people?"

"That soldier's armor has the emblem of the Ingracia Royal family. Does that mean that it was the Kingdom of Ingracia who was behind this?"

The councilors fell in disarray at these comments.

Seeing this reaction, they obviously had nothing to do with the large man.

This was not the decision made by the council, but the action of some separate force.

![break]

Most people were very confused, but some were watching on calmly.

That being Hinata. After being named by the councilor, she immediately stood up from the chair and came between me and the large man.

"Reiner-dono, what is the meaning of this?"

So, the large man's name was Reiner.

If Hinata knew him, this person had to be famous, right?

"How dare you enter without permission! We are in session right now; this is no place for you soldiers to enter!"

Seeing how Hinata had taken action, the speaker also became emboldened and started to scold the soldiers.

The one who responded was not Reiner, but one of the councilors. If I recall correctly, he was the Count of the Kingdom of Ingracia, Gavan or something...

"Hahaha, speaker Leicester-sama, it's no trouble. I called them in to punish those outlaws," Gavan said with a smile. He sat on the second floor on a seat near the speaker.

The speaker's face reddened as he shouted, "Count Gavan, have you lost your mind?!"

This was to be expected. Since one of the councilors was involved in the matter, he was no longer able to proclaim that this had nothing to do with the council.

With Hinata acting as an impartial third party, this ridiculous charade probably worked in my favor. Even though it pissed me off to have been looked down upon, I decided to tolerate it for now and see how things went.

"Gavan-dono! I've never heard of such a thing before!" shouted a man I was pretty sure was councilor Johann, the Duke of the Kingdom of Rostia.

He seemed rather reliable and was not affected by the mental interference. The commotion at the start of the meeting made him look ill as well. It seemed that he would be on my side.

He would likely agree to the Tempest Federation's addition to the council as well.

"Everyone, please be calm. I'm sure that everyone here is actually afraid of Demon Lord Rimuru, are you not? Reiner-dono here is the strongest man in Ingracia. He will defeat Demon Lord Rimuru and control him. In this way, one among the Octagram will be ours to command, and even the Storm Dragon would be in our palm soon!"

Even though he was under fire from multiple councilors, Gavan still remained very relaxed as he announced his justification to stand against me.

Many councilors loudly declared their agreement with Gavan's stance as well.

Surely, I didn't have to tolerate this any longer... Yet the whole situation continued to spiral out of control without my involvement.

"H-how could you do this!"

"We won't allow such a thing to happen! D-don't you dare make light of the council now!"

"Yes! Y-you dare to ignore the will of the council and place your own interests first?"

More and more councilors put their own bit in.

But, for some reason, I had a bad feeling about this. Among the councilors, something about Gavan's smug attitude made me think something else was up.

And my prediction came true.

A well-mannered man entered the venue. "Calm down, everyone. The knight of our kingdom, Reiner, has a point. Since the demon lord came here so carelessly, isn't this a perfect opportunity for us?!"

This blond-haired newcomer clearly wasn't a councilor, yet he was just as arrogant as one. His words riled the venue up instantly.

Obviously, this guy had high authority.

Just as I thought so---

"Your Highness Elric, what are you doing here? Have I not advised you to not do anything foolish...?" Hinata's words helped me clarify his true identity.

This man was the prince of this nation. Therefore, even the councilors could not afford to be rude. No wonder they looked so confused.

So this Prince Elric was the man behind this whole incident?

Some of the councilors seemed to have been instigated by him.

"Hinata, I am really disappointed in you. You fear the demon lords. You have given up on being the fearless guardian of humanity."

"---What did you say?" Hinata's tone was low and cold.

Ah, she looked pissed.

Now I probably wouldn't get the chance to show off.

"Quit your squabbling, Hinata-san. How about it? I don't know how strong the commander of the Holy Knight Order is, but I'm the commanding officer of the Ingracia Knight Order. You are no match for me. You couldn't even win against that punk ass demon lord; how pathetic of you to be licking each other's wounds over there. Are you pissing yourself to run away?"

With a mocking smile, Reiner turned his insults towards Hinata.

This guy was putting himself in danger as well.

Even I was losing it just by watching.

"You bastard..."

"Kukuku, no comeback? Did I hit the mark? Oh, Holy Knight Commander-sama, your position is probably for show as well, no? Did you seduce some horny cardinal to have gotten your job as well? Both sides are all trash, you all must have fought a shitty war. You don't even have the resolve to kill, how laughable!"

Ah, even I got triggered.

*Please stop doing this, would you?*

"But, Hinata, you are not all bad-looking; if you are willing to be my woman, I could take you in as my concubine, you know?"

Ah, this guy... He had just dug his own grave.

Hinata still looked very calm. Her appearance was still that of an ice-cold beauty. However, while appearing emotionless, inside, she must be exploding with fury like a volcano.

Hinata seriously had amazing tolerance.

If it were me, I probably would have lost it already.

"Oi, oi, oi, Sir Reiner, don't you feel a bit ashamed to say something so lewd? That said, I'm actually very fond of that demon lord. It's not good to take every nice thing for yourself, don't you think?"

An inexplicable chill went down my spine. I shivered.

This man, Gavan, wa-was he hitting on me?

What a disgusting old man. Very few things would push me to an emotional response, but he seriously gave me the creeps. This guy was truly horrifying.

Thankfully, Gavan was sitting far away from me. If he were to approach me, my body may move on its own to beat him up.

"---Your Highness Elric, after having this man---Reiner-dono, say such things and do all this, does the Kingdom of Ingracia intend to turn a blind eye to such behavior?" Hinata asked calmly, without leaking even the tiniest bit of anger.

Elric answered with a smile. "Hehehe, Hinata-san, had you been willing to provide us with your aid, we would have treated you with much greater respect. However, you can only blame yourself for provoking Reiner. Oh, I forgot to mention, Reiner is stronger than rank A adventurers. In addition---"

Elric snapped his fingers.

Having been waiting for the moment, the door opened, admitting a man in black. He was followed by a woman in green robes and a group of people wearing jackets embroidered with a familiar symbol.

I knew the man wearing black, too. Squinting, I realized it was Gai, the adventurer the dryad Delta decapitated back in the labyrinth.

As for the people in robes, they were the members of Green Rebellion. They were in a fierce battle with our avatars. Did that mean that the man in the green robe was connected to the Apostles of Verte?

The man covered his head with his robe's hood while covering his face with a scarf. It made him look very suspicious. Judging by his arrogant demeanor, he was likely the leader of the mercenary band.

And my guess was right.

"Allow me to introduce you all. This is Gai-san, rank A adventurer. He's currently Reiner's adjutant. And this is---"

Elric laid his hand on the shoulder of the woman in the green robe. His every movement was very contrived, clearly narcissistic.

"---This is the commander of the famous mercenary band, Apostles of Verte. I am very wary of paying proper respect even when it comes to eliminating demon lords, so I found some truly impressive individuals. There are plenty of skilled fighters here who are stronger than you. Just because you're all somewhat strong, I hope that you won't be too full of yourself."

Elric was very confident.

In my opinion, if he wanted to fight, I was definitely game---

<<Report. This will destroy your reputation by one hundred percent.>>

I suppose.

With all these eyes watching, it was probably a bit of an overkill for the demon lord to fight so rashly.

Moreover, I'd already made a promise---I would only fight against the person that made it through the entire labyrinth. If I broke my promise so carelessly, I would have to handle countless idiots in the future.

More importantly---someone was angrier than me now.

Human beings were truly amazing creatures. When someone started to lose their cool, the person before them would naturally regain their own cool.

"Then let me ask you this, Prince Elric-sama, do you intend to be hostile not only against me, but the entire Western Holy Church? Are you truly prepared for such consequences?"

"Rest assured, neither the Western Holy Church nor the Holy Empire of Lubelius will be affected. As long as you stand aside and watch quietly, I can ensure your personal safety."

Seeing how hard Hinata was trying to suppress her anger, I even forgot what I was angry about.

Besides the speaker, there were other people who were also trying their hardest to protest against Elric and his lackeys. We hadn't been rejected by the council, so we weren't completely isolated.

It was just one idiot who decided to play dirty.

And because of that, there was no need for us to argue until our faces turned red with anger.

"That's not the issue. I was invited by the council to act as a third party this time. My goal was to maintain justness and fairness in the meeting. Therefore, I cannot simply remain silent in light of your actions. It would be a different case had it been the will of the council, but for you alone to intrude like this, don't think I will just sit and watch."

Hinata was likely still mindful of Elric's status and tried to persuade him. Yet Elric was not listening.

"Hinata-sama has a point, please tread carefully and cease this disruption!"

"I've never heard of such a thing, Your Highness Elric! And Count Gavan, did you think you would be able to get away with what you just did?"

"It's rare for His Majesty Rimuru to appear in person, your actions are clearly the issue here!"

"I will not allow such a thing to happen, how dare the Kingdom of Ingracia be so outrageous!"

Some were furious, some were passionate. And the number of councilors raising their voices increased. With these developments, I felt like I was an audience. I was glad that someone else was acting as the protagonist now.

"If there was no justice and fairness, why would the council be needed in the first place?!" the speaker shouted.

Keep going! I cheered internally.

"A bunch of old geezers, quit yapping about. You guys can run your mouth however you want when I'm finished dominating the demon lord."

Reiner seemed confident in his victory.

That guy already pissed off Hinata. I probably wasn't needed.

Just gonna pretend I didn't see that.

"Elric-sama, according to our contract, we only agreed to be your bodyguards. If you intend to tread this path yourself, I will see this as a breach in contract!"

Oh, even the commander of Apostles of Verte didn't want to intervene? I almost treated them the same. It was good that he let us know early enough.

"T-that's right! In my opinion, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama is an extremely dangerous character. He's definitely not to be underestimated after having created a labyrinth with those insane monsters!"

...

Was she praising me?

Our fight to the death was not for nothing. The captain of Green Rebellion, the spirit wielder, seemed to be maintaining great caution against me.

"Hmph, how boring, cowards will only get in our way."

So, Gai was the same kind of person as Reiner? The type of person that was overconfident and ignored other people's opinions?

He looked at me with great hatred, but I couldn't recall anything that I'd done to deserve such hate.

Either way, the venue was on the brink of war. However, perhaps because it lacked a key factor, no one had taken any action.

I sighed internally about the helplessness of the situation and decided to observe quietly.

![soft scene break]

Just as things were about to escalate, Elric suddenly raised his hand.

"Silence! Everybody listen carefully now, Elric-sama has something to say!" Gavan yelled. Somehow, he had moved down from the second floor to right next to Elric without anyone noticing.

Elric nodded his head in satisfaction. Slowly glancing at the surroundings, he began to speak: "Members of the council! At this moment, in this place, you may express your opinion freely! Will you join us and become the champions that will eliminate the demon lord? Or will you seek alliance with the demon lord and stand against humanity? I, Elric von Ingracia, believe that the fellow representatives of the Western Nations will make the right call!"

Elric's eyes shone, almost as if presenting on a stage.

"Oi, oi, oi, are you deciding to vote on the subject now?" I asked unconsciously.

Elric nodded as if this was only natural.

So, with all the mess he was making, he still wanted to save some face?

Moreover, even if they started voting, they wouldn't get over half of the supporting votes---

"Hehe, isn't that only natural? Of course, we will determine the issue democratically with the majority vote. However, it won't matter whether or not we even hold a vote since I am certain that the council will agree to my plan."

That line caught my attention.

His confidence almost implied that the result had been fixed internally. Actually, now that I thought about it, a lot of things were strange about this guy. Even if he was a prince, where did he get the balls to mess around in the venue where all the nations' representatives were gathered? Normally, such an act would not be tolerated.

Then what was the reason for his confidence?

<<Answer. There is a high likelihood that most of the councilors have been bribed.>>

*Ahh, no wonder.*

I didn't expect him to bribe even foreign councilors. If this were handled poorly, it could lead to an international incident which was why I didn't think he would resort to such a dangerous tactic.

It was my miscalculation that led to this mistake.

"Then, let us vote. Let's have a fair and just verdict! We shall defeat the demon lord and dominate him. Those who approve of this idea, please stand up!"

As the prince's voice rang, several sneering councilors stood up.

*I see, so they were all in on this from the get-go.*

If this was the case, then it really couldn't be helped. Even though the situation wasn't ideal, we still had plenty of time. Even if we were to be rejected, we would just have to go from there. Now we can only accept the result of the vote.

<<Report. There are no issues. Everything is within expectations.>>

*Eh, within expectations?*

Raphael-san sent me the impression of an evil grin.

On that note, didn't Souei's investigation reveal a lot of things? For instance, the world's view on our nation, the treasury of different kingdoms, as well as the reactions of different royal families to the event. There were even records of each nation's meetings.

All of this was investigated thoroughly by Wisdom King Raphael-san. I quickly formulated a file of documents inside my 'Stomach.' I took it out and found that they were several ledgers.

*Ah, it's the ledger under the counter!*

*So, you really got everything under the control, Raphael-san.*

Before I knew it, Raphael-san had grasped the weak points of the colluding councilors. The ledger had detailed information about who had taken bribes. If this were to go public, it would severely affect their careers. Once we had hard evidence of their embezzling, all of this would just be a silly drama.

We worked discreetly.

As expected from Wisdom King Raphael-san, how fearsome.

<<Report. There is no need to present this evidence; master has already won.>>

Hmm?

As I was just wondering what that meant, the result came.

Several councilors stood up and began to applaud. Seeing this, Elric began to deliver his victory speech.

"The verdict is decided. The votes are over half, and the motion has been passed!" Elric said smugly.

Gavan and Reiner also held disgusting smiles and prepared to arrest us.

However, they got a bit too ahead of themselves. Most councilors were actually still seated, and there were less than a third of the members standing. That idiot Elric, being so confident in his scheme, had begun bragging about his victory without even checking.

Even the councilors who supported Elric realized that there weren't enough votes for the motion. They looked around in panic, pale, as they realized they were the minority.

The result was obvious.

Those who were against the idea of defeating the demon lord---AKA me--- were the majority.

The number of pages in the ledger was greater than the number of councilors who have stood up for Elric. That number was enough to make the majority, but some of the councilors seemed to have changed their minds.

<<Answer. It seems that with the deactivation of mental interference, they have recovered their conscience.>>

I see.

So, they realized how stupid they were after regaining reason.

That was certainly good to know.

So, all the fellow councilors had decided to join forces with me based on the rules of justice and fairness.

Even though some were moved by bribery before---

<<Answer. That was likely an effect of mental interference. It could evoke people's 'desire.' It seems to have an extraordinarily strong influence.>>

*Ah, then I kind of felt sorry for them.*

It was just like Masayuki's Unique Skill Hero. Similarly, that Skill affected the mind which was very difficult to deal with. Masayuki, however, had no control over it. But this time, the people who orchestrated this incident seemed to be selective with their targets. I wasn't sure who did this, but it was definitely a problematic opponent.

*Could it be that blonde...?*

*Anyway, surely those councilors who have regained their reason were able to tell what's right and wrong. Then I would treat them with the same courtesy and keep their embezzlement a secret.*

But if one councilor's judgement could determine the fate of a nation, then there was something wrong with the system. If organizations like the League of Nations or the United Nations couldn't maintain their integrity and assess themselves accordingly, it would become corrupt.

If the councilor representing a nation turned corrupt, people would also think ill of the nation they represented. If the fate of a nation were so closely tied to one individual's personality and dignity, I hoped they would choose them more carefully.

But that shouldn't really be of my concern.

The problem lay with the people standing in front of us.

People who committed illegal acts needed to pay.

![break]

But before that, I needed to sort this delusional idiot out and make him realize the predicament he'd landed in.

"Oi, will you calm down now, take a look at what is really going on," I said casually to Elric.

"Hmph, what are you---?"

He still hadn't realized his situation.

His sheer stupidity was embarrassing to watch.

"Are you a clown, *honk honk*?" Hinata suddenly called out.

"WHAT?!"

"Oops, how rude of me. Prince Elric-sama is just too hilarious."

Hinata had watched this whole charade with cold eyes. Even as she began to come to my aid, she still looked calm. However, she had already entered her fighting mode.

I didn't want to lose my momentum, but Hinata simply wouldn't stop.

"Looks like more than half of the people here voted against you. As the third party who stands on a fair and just ground, I shall announce this verdict as final. And regarding the matter of whether you have the authority to initiate such a vote, the council shall hold an investigative inquiry later on."

"Uhh, how can this be?! You guys, are you betraying me?!" Elric complained loudly.

Hah, funny, funny.

Things turned out pretty different from how he imagined. His narcissism made his actions even more laudable. Hinata seemed pleased at this, just as I was, to see all the unpleasantness gone.

"I-indeed, Elric-sama has a point!" Gavan said. "Do you have any idea what you are doing?! To have the guts to do something like this, I'll see to it that our nation's aid will---"

"Hold on, what's that supposed to mean? Count Gavan, could you elaborate on that?" interrupted the tired-looking speaker.

While Gavan's protests were almost incomprehensible, it was mixed with phrases that couldn't be unheard. Like 'our nation's aid.'

<<Report. There is available information about it from the documents.>>

Hearing Raphael-san's words, I checked the files and found detailed records there.

"Anti-flooding construction in the Kingdom of Raibach. Food support for the drought in Carnada. There are other nations here as well, and they seemed to have promised them all sorts of aids in payment. So, were they all tasked with what is happening today? By the way, if you were to cancel these aids just because they won't proceed with your plans, it will basically be a public announcement that your actions were nothing but despicable bribery."

"What---?!"

"How do you know such classified information?"

Elric was unable to respond, while Gavan began to shout, trying to hide his panic.

I, on the other hand, was not in a rush nor panic. I merely gave them a smug smile. By doing so, surely, they would have a wrong impression of me. Since I didn't really know what was going on, either. I only did that because Raphael-san said so, and that was about it.

Elric's party was in shock.

The speaker seemed to realize what was going on as he began to glare at Elric and his men.

The tide had quickly turned and now we had the high ground.

A councilor attempted to sit down in the chaos, but I refused to allow that.

Souei used 'Sticky Steel Web' to stop their movements.

"I already warned you. We aren't going to clean up the mess idiots like you make," said the commander of the Apostles of Verte. I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman from the voice.

It appeared that they had severed ties with Elric completely.

The victor had been decided.

And at that moment, my goal was practically complete.

But what I didn't realize then was that there were still fools who couldn't admit defeat.

![soft scene break]

"Quit joking around! Elric-sama, don't worry. When I defeat the demon lord, all these problems will be resolved."

"Oh-oh, oh Reiner!"

"S-Sir Reiner, you have a point. You're still our strongest trump card. You are the most reliable!"

They were relentless. At this point, did they still want to continue what they were doing and ignore the council's will? That might be a bit too reckless. What was going through these idiots' minds?

"Do you guys seriously think you can defeat me?"

"What kind of stupid line is that---of course we are! Are you scared or something? If you come and lick my boots right now, I might let you live and without torture," Reiner responded crudely.

He was dangling the Domination Orb as he spoke, looking like he wanted to control me with that.

Following Reiner's lead, Gai gave some sort of order to the soldiers.

At that, the soldiers quickly began to block the doors. By the looks of it, they didn't plan to let anyone escape the room, and had determined to remedy their previous miscalculation by force.

The members of the Apostles of Verte all stepped back, but there were some other high-level adventurers present as well. They began to draw their weapons against us.

"Y-you people, how dare you show weapons here, what kind of lunacy is this---?!" the speaker shouted; however, the second floor was soon blocked by the soldiers as well. His voice quietened quickly after that, seemingly having been kidnapped by a couple of councilors.

*Please don't blame me for this*---I thought, ready to take action, but then, Hinata got there before me.

"How barbaric. As the witness, I cannot sit and watch this transpire, moreover---"

"Haven't you insulted me enough already?" Hinata finished, smiling dangerously at Reiner.

The venue prohibited any weapon, so instead, she began to fight with her fists. She fought just as ferociously as she would have with her sword.

This guy was toasted.

"Rimuru, leave this fellow to me."

"Kukuku, that's pretty funny. I am the strongest man in Ingracia, I'm gonna rip that smile off your face! Saint, my ass. People praise you as humanity's guardian, and now you've let it all get to your head. Well, that ends today, I shall teach you to face reality!"

Reiner bit off more than he could chew in saying this to Hinata.

He wasn't that weak, to be honest. Being above rank A, if he were to battle Majin Gelmud, I was sure they would end up in a tie.

But he didn't know the sheer distance between heaven and earth. Perhaps his talent seemed impressive in a peaceful kingdom. While he was strong, he wasn't really subjected to battle against monsters often. And so, Reiner had no idea how strong monsters really were.

Gai was just like him in that aspect.

"Hmph, then let me handle the demon lord."

"Okay! Don't kill him, Gai. We've given you the holy sword, use it to its full potential."

"That goes without saying. With gear like this, I'll never lose."

Gai planned to fight me.

He seemed to have received some amazing weapon and was showing it off. But that kind of stuff was, at most, around unique-grade. Moreover, if Gai was relying on skills and gear, the challenger himself probably wouldn't be too strong himself. Gai might have been above rank A, but he still posed no threat against me now.

It would be pretty troublesome to have to deal with a guy like this at this point---that was my genuine thought.

But it seemed that I wasn't needed, after all.

"I cannot take this anymore... You have been truly too rude to our beloved Rimuru-sama," said Shuna, stepping in front of me.

Her aura couldn't be ignored.

She walked towards Gai without a word.

Ah, ah, Shuna looked more pissed than me.

I looked around and saw Benimaru frozen with one step out. He was too late, and now that our eyes met, it was awkward.

Hmm, I understood that.

I felt the same way. I communicated this thought to Benimaru with my eyes; we truly shared a bond.

"Hehe, HAHAHAHAHA! Just how much are you looking down on us here! Demon Lord Rimuru. To hide behind such a weak woman, have you no shame?" Gai laughed at me in front of Shuna's face.

There was no use saying this to me... Since Shuna wanted to go, I didn't want to take away her chance to show herself.

Benimaru was displeased but held back. So, I could only do the same.

"Silence. Trash like you doesn't require Rimuru-sama or Onii-sama to handle. I alone should be sufficient."

"Hmph, don't you regret saying something like that now! I won't show mercy even to women and children."

Gai unsheathed his sword as he finished. As expected from a holy sword, it looked awesome.

Seeing that weapon, Shuna's smile intensified. Her Unique Skill 'Analyzer' must have seen through Gai's true abilities.

Then I didn't need to worry anymore.

![full page image](image9)

Souei had already been waiting for orders for a while. He would handle any other problem. I decided to focus on cheering for Shuna.

And so, under the eyes of the many authority figures within the council, the two groups confronted each other.

![break]

---While just a second ago, one of the two groups was quite confident and menacing.

Yet the confrontation ended almost instantly.

First off, the duel between Hinata and Reiner was like a wrestle between an elephant and an ant.

Hinata was in her formal outfit in order to attend the conference. Her outfit seemed to restrict her movements somewhat, but she still approached Reiner in an extremely agile manner.

"---Huh?"

Reiner, on the other hand, was unable to even react at all.

That was kind of expected to be honest. Even though Hinata had no intention of fighting him seriously, she was still stronger than third-rate demon lords.

She made her way right in front of Reiner before grabbing his arm and shoulder and throwing him away.

Shuna did not hold back, either. Just as Gai had announced, he swung at Shuna without mercy. Yet Shuna did not even flinch before she used her fan to make one smooth slash.

That slash alone shattered Gai's sword.

"---What the fuck?"

As he made this almost comical response, Shuna took the chance to follow up.

"What a piece of trash. I'm not going to kill you that easily. Didn't you just go on about yourself being rank A? Isn't it about time to show me what you've got? Are you giving up already after breaking your sword?" Shuna taunted as she pointed her fan at Gai.

"D-damnit! How dare a mere monster look down on me---!" Gai shouted angrily. No matter how you looked at it, Shuna was playing with him.

The difference in strength was obvious. But for him to think he still had a chance to win, I couldn't help but wonder just how delusional he could be.

By the way---

"So Shuna is good at martial arts as well..."

"Yeah, Hakurou taught her Jujitsu."

The miko princess sure was talented.

Speaking of Hakurou's jujitsu, it was like the ancient martial arts used for combat. It was a dangerous style that contained many lethal techniques. It was definitely beyond ordinary arts of self-defense.

To have taught the princess such a dangerous martial art---I finally got more insight to the aggressive nature of the ogre clan.

Shuna continued her attack.

Gai pulled out his backup sword, yet Shuna, teasing her opponent, tripped Gai over his feet.

The weight of his armor completely obliterated Gai's attack. He desperately tried to get to his feet with no success.

Shuna glared coldly at Gai on the ground.

Her petite mouth began to chant spells.

"I pray to thy god, grant me thy holy power, lend me thy ears to hear my wishes---"

Her words, in the form of prayer, went beyond time and space to be channeled to me.

Although I was standing next to her, it didn't matter at this point.

"Huh? What the hell is going on?"

Gai was shocked as layers of magic circles began to close around him.

"Wait! T-this magic is---!"

Ah hah, so Gai knew.

I guess he really was above rank A. But even if you knew, there was no way he could deal with this. At this point of the casting, he couldn't possibly escape. He had no choice but to tough it out or try to defend himself.

Although, I doubted he would be able to do either. After all, this spell---

"EWWEEEEEEE---! P-please stop---!"

"---All things in life shall come to an end! 'Disintegration'!"

---Was the strongest spell in all holy magic.

A stream of light devoured Gai, and there was nothing left---or so it seemed.

Woah, it looked like Shuna had killed the guy---or so I thought. She didn't, however.

"Guu...guu...guuu..."

The light faded, leaving behind a half-naked Gai. He probably lost all the strength in his legs and couldn't stand up as he collapsed on the ground, exhausted. His intelligence seemed to have devolved to that of an infant as he started bawling with tears and snot all over his face.

But he lived. Congrats, congrats.

"Ara, looks like my technique *was not masterful enough*. The spell didn't seem to work. I see that spells that I'm still practicing really are quite useless."

Shuna grinned as she said all that nonsense. I almost couldn't hold back my tease of 'Seriously?' After all, to use 'Disintegration' so precisely as to only destroy the armor, it only could have only been done with absolutely perfect execution.

---Even better, it hadn't even been a few days since I asked Shuna to study 'Holy Magic' with Adalmann. Yet somehow, she had already mastered the most difficult spell. It seemed like she really was talented in magic. Her Unique Skill 'Analyzer' must have played a vital role in assisting her study.

Anyway, that aside, with Shuna easily taking care of Gai, it was just Hinata now. Yet the result of her fight went without saying.

![break]

![break]

"S-Sir Reiner! What's the hold up now?!"

"Shut that arrogant woman up right now. You also have to defeat the demon lord as well. Now it's not the time to slack around!"

Gavan and Elric did not understand what was going on as they shouted at Reiner.

Yet, Reiner didn't move at all. In fact, he was frozen. His ego deflated as Hinata stared him down. Having been sent flying away just before, Reiner must have realized the immense difference between his and Hinata's strength.

"Ehh, you are not approaching me? Instead of coming to me, you are just gonna stand there? I'm coming to you then."

Hinata took one step forward---

"HYA-HYAAAAA---!"

While making what was perhaps the most embarrassing sound in the world, Reiner covered his head up with his hands and squatted down on the ground.

A liquid leaked out of his crotch, steaming slightly.

Oi, oi, oi, so he ended up pissing himself.

He wasn't just a clown, but the entire circus.

"R-Reiner-dono!"

"W-what is happening? You are supposed to be the strongest, even stronger than Hinata the Saint!"

Delusional people sure were scary. After all, they could give out such a cruel order so casually.

Reiner began to cry like a child as tears and drool went down his face. He did not move an inch from his fetal position.

He was done for.

It'd be pretty silly to keep worrying about him.

Anyway, that was one less problem for us.

![break]

After the victor had been decided, I stood up from my seat on the first floor and glanced around at the councilors.

The person who stood out was Elric, who was standing in the front and behaving most bizarrely.

The members of the Apostles of Verte stood beside him, but they probably had no intention of antagonizing me. They casually began to distance themselves, indicating they had no tie to Elric.

"Then, Elric---aren't you Your Highness the prince? Why exactly did you plan to trouble me like this? Do you wish to continue?"

"Ah, no..."

"You guys over there as well, it's quite obvious that your nations acknowledge this whole charade as well, right? Should you all not be considered as accomplices?" I asked, smiling.

"N-no, it's because..."

"P-please hold on a second, Rimuru-dono, I mean, Your Majesty---"

"P-please allow me to say something!"

They, however, looked pale and kept their heads down. A few of them tried their hardest to find excuses but I ignored them.

Because of Souei, they were unable to move from their current positions. Having been locked in motion, the councilors who were against me could only beg for mercy. There was no need for me to deal with them anymore; they wouldn't be able to do any more harm.

And so, I was sure that I had got the upper hand.

To the others, I was like a calm bishoujo pressuring a bunch of middle-aged men. It was a rare sight, a hilarious one as well.

How could any of these cheap-shots ever manage to suppress a demon lord?

They had no common sense---or should I say that they were too retarded to understand the reality of the situation. Which was why they failed.

With that being said, their plan was a bit too rough around the edges. Were they seriously thinking about beating and controlling me? Perhaps it was just like what Hinata said, their goal was to provoke me to use force...

"Now then, how would you compensate me---"

Wait, hold on.

Most of the councilors were under mental interference. Someone had stimulated the councilors' desire. If that had continued, Elric's proposal would probably have passed.

That wouldn't have been good for us. Regardless of what was going on, it was not easy to reverse what had been approved by the council.

It was thanks to Raphael-san that it devolved to the charade just now.

In other words, someone held hostile intent towards me---

<<Report. Killing intent detected, directed towards the individual 'Elric.'>>

Shit!

I sensed that with my 'Magic Perception' as well. Somewhere two kilometers away from here, someone was directing killing intent towards the conference.

It was so far away, what could they be planning---?

I immediately executed 'Thought Acceleration' and confirmed the situation. 'Magic Perception' showed a wild-looking red-haired woman. She was holding a small black iron block---a pistol.

Huh? Why was she using a pistol when she was so far away?

What was the effective range of that gun---?

<<Answer. Official name for the weapon is Walther P99---small in size but extremely competent. Light in weight, high in proficiency. Its effective range is sixty meters.>>

---Right, knowing this information wouldn't help much either.

Even if it were extremely proficient, when its effective range was sixty meters, it wouldn't matter.

Right now, the building we were in was located in the central area of the Kingdom of Ingracia and it was a special-alert zone. The walls of the surrounding area had been processed with magic-resisting enchantments. It was extremely firm and couldn't be pierced by any weaker attacks.

Moreover, the bullet that would be shot would still obey the laws of physics, being affected by gravity and air resistance. You could strengthen it with magic or Skills, but you might as well have just prepared a sniper rifle.

On top of that, even if you were using a sniper rifle, there was no use if you couldn't see the target.

The woman could not see Elric directly from that position. Even if she had my 'Magic Perception' and locked onto a target, sniping wasn't possible as there were many walls in its direct path.

That wasn't even adding on the fact that with the recent assassination of Duke Muze, the conference building was well guarded. I was also cautious and had made preparations beforehand. I'd confirmed that it would be difficult to snipe from an area that far away from the conference. That was why her action would be meaningless...logically speaking.

Could it be that she could deflect bullets and change their path---?

Just as that thought crossed my mind, the red-haired woman pulled the trigger.

In a moment's delay, as if in a frame-by-frame animation, I watched the bullet leaving the chamber at an incredible speed before suddenly being sucked into a black hole that appeared out of nowhere.

---Eh!

To my shock, the bullet disappeared without a trace.

<<Report. It's a form of 'Spatial Movement,' called 'Spatial Connection.'>>

'Spatial Connection' apparently was a Skill that could connect two recognized points. The distance between the two points couldn't be too far away, and the area of effect was very narrow, so it didn't need much effort to perform.

But right now, I had no time to listen to explanations like that.

The red-haired woman was comprehending the space through 'Magic Perception.' The next second, the bullet reemerged next to Elric. She launched the Skill at the location with precision.

As a result---she completely ignored the two kilometers in between us as well as the outer walls. The assassination plan was about to succeed.

A small black hole appeared around fifty centimeters away from Elric's head. And from it flew the lethal bullet traveling at over four hundred meters per second.

It was just as powerful as if it were shot nearby. There was no obstacle in its path, and the bullet was closing in on Elric.

Slowly, but surely. I could see it traveling.

Yet in this situation, there was nothing I could do. I didn't have time to warn him, and even if I were to take action, I wouldn't be fast enough to stop the bullet.

<<...There is no problem. Activate Ultimate Skill 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth?' YES/NO.>>

*Eh, will it seriously make it?* That was just my own doubt, but I still listened to Raphael-san's proposal.

And the next moment---woah, incredible.

Ignoring space-time, the bullet lay in my hand, motionless.

"...!! Are you okay?"

Hinata's expression changed drastically as she ran up to check on Elric.

The captain of the Apostles of Verte also looked shocked and gave me an inconspicuous glance. She didn't say anything and turned to check if Elric was fine as well.

Elric was baffled, having been asked all these questions when he had no idea what had happened.

Only a few people realized what just transpired. However, it seemed that the magic just now triggered the alert system as the building began to echo with an alarm.

Because of this incident, the conference was cut short.

![soft scene break]

"Souei, go after the culprit."

"I've already sent my 'Clone' after her."

While the councilors were calming down, we acted on our own.

The people around us also began to examine what had happened. Speaker Leicester, the captain of the guards, the captain of Apostles of Verte and Hinata, in particular, discussed amongst themselves.

"Did they try to kill someone with this?"

"This is a bullet, you need a certain item to fire it, something that we don't really have around here."

"Then, could the culprit's target be His Highness Elric? And their goal was..."

"You can guess that he wants to pin the blame on Demon Lord Rimuru."

"I see. If Prince Elric were killed under those circumstances, people would surely direct their suspicion towards His Majesty Rimuru. Tempest's inclusion into the council would prove to be difficult."

"Indeed. Perhaps that was their true intention. These fools were used as disposable pawns."

Hinata answered everyone's questions and proceeded with the investigation smoothly.

It was most fortunate that I wasn't considered a suspect.

Elric was saved, but for disrupting the council conference this time, he would still be sentenced afterward.

"S-someone was trying to kill me?" he muttered anxiously.

![break]

While this guy did do stupid things, I didn't want him to die.

"Ah, don't worry. Since you---my apologies, Elric-dono wasn't killed, these unknown culprits have failed, and their plan was disrupted. There's no reason for them to attempt it again now."

Mainly because it would be impossible to try and pin the crime on me. In this way, Elric had lost his value.

That's why he didn't need to be afraid of that assassination anymore.

"B-but, I'm a prince of a powerful nation, this talk of value---"

Hmm---that was a hard question to answer, actually.

Before his charade today, as an heir to the crown, his value would have been quite high. However, he wasn't actually the crown prince, as there were other possible successors as well. Moreover, with today's events...

It may have been different had their plan succeeded, but given what actually took place, the Kingdom of Ingracia wouldn't be naive enough to put an idiot prince on the throne. And even if his home nation didn't go after him for doing something like this, they would probably not allow the prince to fail, either.

The chances of Elric becoming the king had plummeted down to zero.

"Anyhow, a person's life is not only about becoming the king. You must still somehow make up for what happened today, but perhaps you can reflect afterward and examine your life slowly. I also became a demon lord because of a series of unexpected events. After all, I never really wanted to become a demon lord, anyway. Now that I am one, there's no going back, so I suppose I will just utilize my position properly."

"Hehe, is Your Majesty the Demon Lord trying to comfort the prince, I mean, me? I thought you'd be scarier and more malicious to humans..."

"I'm not comforting you. But about your question, I'm basically a pacifist."

Hearing my words, Elric huffed, frustrated. It seemed that he had accepted reality and had fallen silent.

"I was so foolish to have been deceived. Gavan, we must take responsibility."

"Y-Your Highness!"

"You're the one who came up with this plan. I will probably be trialed for having been deceived by you as well. You should prepare yourself for what's coming, Count Gavan."

Elric really seemed to have come to terms with reality. He cooperated and followed the guards.

![break]

That's right, Gavan was the conspirator behind all this---anyone could see that now. It was he who instigated Elric and caused the commotion this time.

My guess was that Gavan was being used as well. There was quite the mysterious organization behind him. But I couldn't just stop and accept this conspiracy theory. It was better to investigate seriously. But to this day, Souei had not been able to find any clues.

However, if he could catch that sniper, maybe we would get some answers.

Other than her, there was someone else I could question as well.

"Well now, Gavan-san, may I ask you something?"

I turned to the arrested Gavan.

"W-what is it? What could you, a demon lord, want from me?"

Even now, Gavan's attitude did not change.

"Please tell me, what was your intention in manipulating Prince Elric?"

"Ahaha, what are you on about? No idea, I know nothing."

"W-what are you on about! You're the one who deceived me---!"

"Where's your proof? I was indeed asked by His Highness the Prince to invite you here, but I had no idea that you were up to some plot like this."

"Gavan-dono, there's no use finding excuses now. Not just me, but every councilor here saw what happened."

Johann wouldn't allow Gavan to find any excuses. Most of the councilors agreed. Even the people who were tied up and arrested nodded along. We had our witnesses.

"Uhh, but I really don't know anything. The prince was the one behind everything---I was just following orders!"

"Bullshit! You're the one who got that orb and pledged it to me!"

"That wasn't me at all. I've already said this once, please show some evidence---"

It looked like Gavan planned to play dumb until the very end.

He was too cunning for the circumstances, surely, he was confident enough that he wouldn't leave any clues. If that were the case, would that mean it'd be difficult to incriminate him as well? He would probably have a horrible reputation for a while, but probably intended to shamelessly come back some time after.

This was why noblemen were so annoying.

You can't get careless, or else you won't be able to defeat them completely. I could just resort to force and end the matter easily, but that was our last resort.

![break]

Suddenly, the gate opened.

"His Majesty Aegil has arrived! All present, salute at once!"

As the servant shouted, people began to kneel.

I almost knelt alongside them, but thankfully Shuna and Benimaru stopped me. If I really did that, that would've been an actual problem.

Apart from us and Hinata, everyone immediately began to show their respect. Even the speaker of the council lowered his head a bit.

As expected from the King of Ingracia.

Ingracia King Aegil disinterestedly glanced at the few councilors Souei had tied up and then turned his eyes back to look at me.

This middle-aged man had a beautiful face. The thick blonde hair and the tilting moustache suited him very well.

"It seems that my son has given you much trouble."

"I suppose so. But the misunderstanding has been resolved."

I didn't want the matter to get any more severe. If the human society were willing to accept us, I suppose I could turn a blind eye to some rudeness.

"---Is that so? I have not come as king, but as a father to apologize to you, as well as to thank you." As he finished, King Aegil nodded to me lightly.

If even the king was willing to lower his head in apology, this whole ordeal was likely resolved.

"I accept your apologies, but hopefully this won't happen again."

"Yes, I understand. I wish to build a healthy relationship with you, too."

King Aegil's eyes were sharp and straight when he said this. I could tell he was genuine.

It was best to not ponder too much this time and just believe him. If he were to betray us, we'd worry about that in time.

"Then I look forward to hearing from you."

"Likewise."

We shook hands. By the way, he seemed to have ignored the table I just broke.

And thus, we made amends.

"Everyone, please raise your heads."

Hearing this, people began to do so. Everyone here understood full well what had just transpired, but it didn't mean that anything would ever be on the official record. After all, a king shouldn't lower his head to anyone. This was probably King Aegil's last resort^[Original phrase was "苦肉の策," which is a tactic used in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It is to harm your ally intentionally in order to deceive your enemy.].

"F-Father..."

"Enough, I shall reeducate you."

"---Yes, I understand."

"Good."

King Aegil nodded before turning to Gavan.

"Count Gavan."

"Yes, sir!"

"Weren't you going on about wanting evidence? Do you think you can do whatever you want because I'm not around?"

"No, no, there is no such thing..."

"I've contacted the magical inquisitors. You will be handed to them."

"AHHH!"

Gavan's face paled and he started to plead.

"I-I beg your forgiveness! I'll confess everything, please have mercy!"

His expression was convincing enough, but King Aegil's reaction was rather cruel.

"Take him away."

" " "Yes, sir!" " "

His servants eyed the knights protecting the king and began to move. The knights also moved to arrest Reiner and the others as well.

"Reiner-dono, Gai-dono, please turn yourself in as well."

"Stop this, get off me!"

"Do you know who I am!"

Reiner and the others were shouting and trying to resist before a group of men in black hoods showed up. They immediately fell silent.

These people were probably the so-called magical inquisitors.

Even though Reiner and Gai tried to resist, the newcomers effortlessly took care of them. While the two were not weak, they were like infants to these hooded figures. It was obvious that these inquisitors were no ordinary people.

As expected from the Kingdom of Ingracia, they were, indeed, a powerful nation. They had kept leashes on some very impressive fellows.

<<Report. It has been deduced that this is likely a demonstration of force. In order to inform master that this kingdom possesses strong individuals as well.>>

In other words, he was probably saying "don't look down on us." It was a public announcement to remind us that Reiner was not the strongest that Ingracia could offer so as to save the face for their nation.

Being a king sure looked hard. He had to plan something like this just so that the demon lord wouldn't get the better of them.

If Elric's plan actually worked, the king would probably have wanted to use me to fortify the authority of Ingracia. But to be honest, if they didn't have even the slightest evil intentions, there was no way they could pitch a fight against any other cunning noblemen.

"Sorry for the interruption. Our nation shall take care of the remaining matters."

Leaving this line, the king and his men left.

They were smart and even took the Domination Orb. But that wasn't a problem. It'd be problematic if they used it for evil causes, so I secretly broke a core functioning part.

I didn't want to get more involved in the matter, so I saw them off quietly.

We rested a bit in the afternoon and reconvened the conference thereafter.

Unlike the morning conference, the councilors all seemed highly unmotivated. There was no need to threaten these exhausted noblemen. They needed to examine and pass important motions.

First, acknowledge the Tempest Federation as a nation.

Second, allowing the inclusion of the Tempest Federation into the council.

Thirdly, sharing the military authority of the council with the Tempest Federation.

![break]

Those were the three main items that passed.

The document I forced them to examine was passed as well. There was a unanimous agreement. Although it was a lengthy process with various complications, my document was still passed. And the matter was set in stone.

I wasn't good at dealing with the cunning councilors. It was very tiring scheming and detecting words in words.

I handed all that to Raphael-san.

<<...Understood.>>

In terms of results, we kind of used brute force to resolve the issues.

But I didn't really participate. It was Hinata, and our precious little Shuna-chan. I, on the other hand, would be considered the benefactor who rescued Elric. That was enough to prove my generous heart. I was personally very satisfied.

Apart from that---

It was a fool's errand to use force against the demon lord---they all knew this, so I suppose it was very meaningful.

The conference ended smoothly, and we all left.

And so, the conference, filled with twists and turns, had finally concluded.
