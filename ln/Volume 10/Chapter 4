# Chapter 4: The True|Identity of the|Mastermind

The beautiful ex-mercenary---Glenda Attley. Every time she pulled her trigger, a life was taken.

Ever since she was summoned to this world, she held onto her beloved firearm. It had never betrayed Glenda's expectations. It became a part of her, so much so that shooting became second nature. With the addition of the Unique Skill 'Sniper,' Glenda was invincible.

Unique Skill 'Sniper'---this Skill has three main functions: 'Magic Perception' for the amazing ability to identify any target, 'Outcome Calculation' to analyze actions, and 'Space Manipulation.'

The last function in particular, 'Space Manipulation,' made Glenda almost invincible. Within her field of vision, Glenda could connect the space between any two points. In other words, her effective range of fire was anywhere within her eyesight. She could fire a bullet right next to the enemy's head, making bullets pass through any obstacles at will to hit the intended target. Factors such as gravity and air resistance could be neglected by her, allowing her to perform long-distance sniping even without a sniper rifle.

These conditions made her emerge victorious in every fight.

However, the misstep she made last time made her realize that there were stronger individuals out there.

*It wouldn't work. Monsters like that are too strong for me.*

With a single glance, Glenda had immediately recognized how dangerous her enemy was. That opponent---Diablo---was someone Glenda couldn't hurt with her pistol. This wasn't simply about physical attacks being ineffective against Diablo, however.

There were two different types of bullets in her arsenal that Glenda could fire: normal bullets and magic bullets. If she didn't want to leave any magical trace, she would use the normal bullets. Faced by monsters that were resistant to physical attacks, she would concentrate her own mana into bullets and fire them as a magical attack. It was a universal mechanism that was designed to be effective against all manner of opponents. Therefore, one would assume that Glenda had no blind spots in that regard.

However, her fight against Diablo was different.

Glenda's instincts were screaming at her to run away. Her 'Outcome Calculation' she had relied on predicted no other outcome but her demise.

Even with her overpowered abilities, there were still opponents in this world that she couldn't defeat. On that day, this fact was laid bare in front of her eyes. It was hard for her to swallow.

![break]

And today---

Glenda started to work on the assassination as her target came within range of her 'Magic Perception.'

The bullet she shot would appear around fifty centimeters away from the target. In a blink of an eye, her target would receive a headshot---that was common sense.

Fifty centimeters was a wonderful distance. When connecting dimensions, there could only be a certain amount of mass overlapping with the wormhole, anything exceeding a certain threshold would cause the connection to fail. In other words, if her target moved around, the space that Glenda connected between them could be disrupted.

That's why she chose fifty centimeters.

No matter how strong her opponent was, no one could deal with such a small object suddenly appearing at such a short distance. The bullet would tear through the air at supersonic speed; her target probably wouldn't even catch a glimpse of it.

*It may be a different case for a monster like Diablo, but some prince of a large state is much easier to deal with. Never mind, there's no use for me to sigh at this point. Let's just prepare for the next encounter.*

At that moment, Glenda was calm and composed, but in the next second, something shocking occurred. The bullet that was meant to pierce through the prince's skull disappeared.

"How can this be! What happened?!"

The unexpected situation of paranormal activity became her reality. She didn't understand the reason, but if someone were to have done this, it must've been the demon lord.

"Is it that guy? I've underestimated the master of that asshole demon!"

Glenda's instincts told her so. She fired once more.

If the perfect ambush didn't work, taking more shots would be in vain. Even though she knew this in her heart, the mission would fail if she did not do so. Her master Mariabell and Elder Granbell would not tolerate such a misstep.

This, ultimately, made her miss her chance to flee.

"Heh, indeed. You have underestimated Rimuru-sama. That is unforgivable, and I don't intend to forgive you either."

"Tsk, who is there?"

"My name is Souei, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama's loyal 'Secret Spy.'"

Glenda was shocked, but she realized something. He didn't ask for her name. Glenda judged that it was not because he wasn't interested, but that he had planned to capture her before interrogating her.

If that was the case, all that was left for her was to flee in order to hide the information she held.

The assassination had failed.

And now, the worst outcome would be her capture. If she were to continue making mistakes, she would be executed for incompetence. There had been several colleagues of hers who suffered that fate. She had to prioritize running away.

After making up her mind, she engaged a stand-off against her enemy.

"...He knew about my planned attack?"

"I spoke too much, but Rimuru-sama has already seen through everything. You can resist all you want; I don't plan to kill you anyway. But the more you resist, the more you will suffer."

"Hmph! How generous of you. Then I shall not hold back."

Without hesitation, Glenda pulled her trigger as she finished her sentence.

She only shot one normal bullet. There were sixteen more rounds left. However, she figured that it wouldn't work on this majin called Souei.

*Magic bullets might work...* As she thought so, Glenda pulled out her army knife. It was clean and swift. There was elegance in her ferocious strike as Glenda slashed at Souei. He dodged the attack with minimal movement, Glenda grinned as she saw that.

The knife was enchanted with her mana. Not only did her weapon deal physical damage, she also gave the knife a magic effect. This was specifically used to deal with opponents who were resistant to physical attacks. Souei surely wouldn't have thought that the knife was of any threat.

Moreover, Glenda had seen through Souei's preference in combat.

*This guy doesn't like dragging on with combat. If that's the case, he probably would get tricked by a simple attack like this. I'll break your calm demeanor.*

As she thought, Glenda continued her attack. Her right hand had her knife while her left hand held her gun. She didn't hesitate to continue shooting as she observed Souei's reaction. As she predicted, he didn't react much, since Souei thought that even if the attack were to connect, it wouldn't deal much damage.

But he wasn't getting careless, he was still very cautious of Glenda's right hand.

*I've still got one more card up my sleeve. But among the people I've battled, he's probably the strongest.*

As far as she was concerned, Diablo didn't count. Her logic was that opponents she couldn't fight at all should not be included.

It was then that Souei's left index finger twitched. Glenda didn't miss it, she immediately backflipped away upon sensing the danger. She quickly distanced herself from her opponent.

It was the right call. In the next second, extremely thin strings closed in on where Glenda was just a moment ago.

"Ho, you are quite sharp."

"Thanks for the compliment, you ain't half bad."

While exchanging praise, Glenda didn't forget to shoot in return of the favor.

It was not too big of a threat to Souei. As opposed to dodging, he was more focused on approaching her head on.

*As expected, he's pretty naive. That's great, this type of enemy is easy to take care of.*

Magic bullets didn't require gunpowder. They could be shot while suppressed, and you could mix them in while shooting normal bullets.

Her opponent, who had gotten used to her tactic, would be too careless to defend himself. She would be able to defeat him when he least expected it. That was Glenda's strategy.

The attack that he thought was incapable of harming him would become the fatal blow. Even if her opponent were on guard, such a sudden strike would still be difficult to react to.

Glenda had defeated some strong people before, and Souei's reaction was just like theirs. As his right shoulder was hit by the magic bullet, he was sent flying spectacularly.

"Ahahahaha, how embarrassing for a handsome man like you. Lamar fell for the same trick. The more confident you are, the easier it is to be played by a simple trick such as this."

Glenda laughed out loud. But her eyes weren't slacking. She was inspecting Souei's wound.

You shouldn't be careless when hunting your prey. That was the ironclad rule of warfare. Until she made sure that her opponent was dead, Glenda would not let her guard down.

After all, she didn't think that one bullet would be able to kill Souei.

"...I see you are more difficult to handle than I expected."

"You a sore loser or something? Sorry, but since you've seen my face, I'll have to eliminate you."

Souei stood up, his right arm missing. Glenda could see her victory before her. Still, she was even more cautious as she pointed the gun in front of her.

*Magic bullet worked. And now for my trump card, I'm gonna make sure to blow his head off.*

Glenda activated her Unique Skill 'Sniper' and aimed cautiously.

"Heh, rest assured, the order I received was to capture you. I suppose the goal was to interrogate you for information, but Rimuru-sama is a kind man. If you were to tell us everything we wanted to know, he wouldn't take your life."

"You've got balls talking all big at this point!" Glenda roared as she pulled the trigger.

Three bullets aimed for his head and two for his heart. Five magic bullets in total were fired as planned. The bullets were shot and instantly warped in space, appearing in front of Souei, as well as the right of his head. There were also bullets shot directly in front of his heart and to his left flank.

All five bullets tore into his body.

Warp Bullet---Glenda's ultimate technique. The magic bullets spawned from mana were different from normal bullets and would disrupt magicule. Even if her opponent could regenerate, they wouldn't be able to revive after being hit.

No matter if her opponent were a master of knife and gun play, when getting hit by supersonic bullets coming from all directions, even the best amongst the elite would not be able to handle it.

Glenda had come to understand her capabilities from her past experiences. That was the secret to her survival. For this reason, Glenda was certain that Souei had met his end.

Souei's body crumbled into black smoke in front of Glenda's eyes. She was relieved. Since she had laid eyes on Souei, she had felt a deep feeling of unease. Even though it was not as sharp as when she ran into Diablo, her instinct told her that her opponent was dangerous.

"You are done. Since you were strong, I didn't want to hold back," Glenda muttered after feeling greatly reassured.

Yet it seemed that she had done so too early.

A voice that, by all common sense, should not have been heard was raised behind her.

"Is that so? Then you shall promptly admit defeat and let me capture you."

Glenda jumped away subconsciously. She turned back quickly and found Souei standing there.

"H-how is this possible! Didn't you just die...?"

"Heh, you're just full of jokes, aren't you? How could that weak of an attack have killed me? In the first place, there's no reason for me to lose to a cheap shot like you."

"Then I'll do it again---eh, what?!"

Glenda's line was cut short.

It was to be expected. To her disbelief, Souei's aura began to spread all around her. She quickly initiated 'Magic Perception' and saw a reality that she didn't want to face.

"N-no way! How can this be, why are you everywhere? What kind of joke is this! What kind of Skill is this!"

"It's very simple. I have a Skill called 'Clone.' And that was it. They are not as strong as me, but since you were able to defeat one of my 'Clones,' you should be proud of yourself," Souei praised Glenda. Yet there were still four other Soueis standing. Glenda had nowhere to run.

"Damn it all---!"

After shouting in a tone devoid of womanly charm, she launched her attack at Souei.

The battle that would teach her despair, began.

![hard scene break]
On a balcony overlooking the blooming flowers in the courtyard, a young girl, a young man, and an old man stood around a round table, looking intently at each other.

These three were Mariabell, Yuuki and Johann.

"It failed, it really failed."

This line came out of Mariabell's lips in a sad tone. All the while, her face was casual as always. It was expected of her, as it was a part of her plan.

"Gavan sure is unlucky. What a waste of your efforts he's been."

Johann, who sat in front of Mariabell, sighed with wine in his hand. Although he didn't really mean it, he did feel some sympathy towards Gavan. After all, just like Johann, Gavan was a member of the Five Great Elders.

Correction, former member of the Five Great Elders. The miscalculation this time had led to Gavan's complete loss of authority.

"Gavan was so useless. It's probably because he has stayed in Ingracia for too long, that he has become somewhat attached to the king. Or else he would have had full control over the royal family long ago."

"...Don't ask for the impossible. Even us Rossos were not able to influence the central power of Ingracia, let alone Gavan---"

"No, that's not correct. It's a piece of cake to control the core of their power. All we need to do is to kill everyone else and leave one heir and one only. It would be perfect if the child had Gavan's blood in him."

"I...suppose you have a point..."

Mariabell knew the history of bloodshed in that dark era of time, so she thought such a method was fairly mild. In fact, in terms of the amount of blood that would be spilled, this was relatively peaceful, she thought.

But to Johann, he wanted to comment that "A large nation's security won't be that slacking." Even if she could come up with such an idea, to execute it would not be as simple.

"However, I am interested in the magical inquisitors."

"---Are you referring to the heathens under the command of the king of Ingracia?"

"Yep, how annoying, how very annoying. They must have been desperate to build up their military just to stand against us Rossos."

"Well then, what do you think?"

"They seemed pretty strong. Gavan has experienced them firsthand and informed me about it."

To subjects dominated by her 'Greed,' Mariabell could share intelligence with them to some extent. Any information obtained by an individual would inform Mariabell. That's why she used Gavan as a disposable pawn. She did so to draw out the magical inquisitors to handle the situation, so she could investigate their secret.

The incident that led to all of this was the stupid action Gavan had directed at Demon Lord Rimuru. Since Gavan was a count of the Kingdom of Ingracia, surely, it would have lured out the magical inquisitors.

Mariabell had foreseen that. And just as she predicted, she uncovered the secret of the magical inquisitors. The revelation made it apparent. They were merely humans who became majins after absorbing the power of monsters.

This was quite unlike Majin Razen of the old Kingdom of Farmus, who had entered a higher state of being through his own training.

Due to the repulsive reaction with the monster elements, magical inquisitors even had their self-consciousness erased. To Mariabell, they were simply uninteresting toys. However, before they transformed into majins, they still seemed to possess consciousness. Depending on the amount of elements absorbed, they could fight in almost any circumstances. Their strength would be close to flawless as they broke through rank A.

*That does seem kind of useful*---Mariabell thought.

"How terrifying. In order to gain such information, you knew from the start that Gavan's plan would have failed, yet you still permitted it anyway?"

"Not at all. My goal was to raise your credibility. Demon Lord Rimuru would now think that you are worthy of trust."

"That's..."

No, even if he didn't ask, he understood. Mariabell's goal from the start was to eliminate Demon Lord Rimuru; the magical inquisitors were just a bonus.

She wanted Johann to investigate Rimuru.

*If I were to fail as well, am I going to end up with the same fate as Gavan and be eliminated by her...?*

He wasn't as incompetent as Gavan, yet in addition to this thought, Johann had now gained an unspeakable horror towards Mariabell.

*Y-you gotta be kidding me. I became one of the Five Great Elders and stood at the top of the seven seas, how can some child like this...*

But that was just in his mind, these were words he couldn't speak out loud.

Johann returned to the previous topic.

"Then how about we let the magical inquisitors handle Demon Lord Rimuru? We could frame Demon Lord Rimuru with some crime and---"

"No, no, that would only anger the demon lord. The magical inquisitors may be tough, but they're only so strong. It's impossible for them to stand against the demon lord. Such a plan won't work."

"That's sad to hear... So, our best option is to cooperate with the demon lord, after all?"

Mariabell shook her head upon hearing so, dismissing that option.

"No use, that's no use. Basically, except for grandfather, everyone has had a huge misunderstanding towards the situation, including you."

"Misunderstanding?"

"Yes, that's right. Humans and demon lords are equal---that's your misunderstanding. Do you know why I proposed to grandfather to eliminate the demon lord?"

"Was it because the demon lord would create a new economic circle and will threaten us economically?"

"Yes. But that was simply on the surface level. The real reason is that we can do nothing about the demon lord."

Johann was deeply afraid of the young girl, Mariabell. And just now, Mariabell responded with a face of displeasure. Feeling uneasy, Johann hurried her to continue her explanation.

"What does that mean?"

"Demon Lord Rimuru's military might is truly frightening. What do you think will happen if this demon lord uses military force to negotiate with us?"

"T-that would be...!"

Upon hearing her explanation, Johann finally realized the severity of the matter.

In this world, due to the common threat of monsters, kingdoms seldom battled amongst themselves. Even if there were to be a dispute, the council would intervene to mitigate. The nation with greater economic capabilities normally spoke with greater impact.

However, even for large nations such as the old Farmus, or Ingracia, their military alone would not be able to stand against the combined force of all the council's member states.

"Moreover, the strength of this nation is not their military alone. To be bound by rules is the equivalent of losing freedom. However, if they were to make the rules themselves, surely, that would mean their nation would not be at any loss, wouldn't it?"

Even if Tempest decided to follow the rules set up by the council, the future remained unknown. If everyone learned the economic value of the Tempest Federation, the Western Nations would be their puppets to toy with.

The demon lord could achieve domination through peaceful means.

Or through military force.

Or with economic pressure.

The strong nations would have the authority to dictate---that was an unchanging truth.

"Pathetic, how very pathetic. The council can lay some impressive rhetoric on the negotiation table, but all of that depends on the generosity of the demon lord. Time will pass and a new era will begin, our fate will rest on the demon lord's whims, when the time comes."

"T-that's..."

Johann understood, he knew this was how things may develop.

"But, the demon lord said that he wished to coexist with humans---"

As he was halfway through his sentence, Johann found Mariabell's cold eyes glaring at him.

"Fools, how foolish, not just you, the same goes for all of the council. What a bunch of idiots."

Unimpressed, Mariabell began to explain further so that Johann could understand.

Even if there hadn't been a problem now, what did the future hold? If humans who had forgotten the threat the Storm Dragon posed, pissed off Demon Lord Rimuru...

"I don't know how long a demon lord can live, however, I know that human lives *are* limited. If we cannot stop the demon lord's ambition now, the dream of us Rossos would practically be destroyed."

That demon lord could always change his mind. It may be a different case for humans, but to expect those with longevity to share the same value as humans---how could something that stupid happen, Mariabell explained.

"So, the idea of cooperating with the demon lord, or even exploiting the demon lord, are both huge misjudgments. They are impossible."

Johann was at a loss of words.

Almost as if to pour salt on Johann's wounds, the 'Blood Shadow' under his command reported back to him through 'Magic Communication.' The message was that Glenda had been defeated.

"How is that possible! Glenda was captured?"

Johann was shocked.

"---Is this true?"

Even Mariabell was unable to hide her surprise. Glenda was praised for her discretion. Mariabell was confident that she could survive during any crises. She didn't put her trust in Glenda's personality or anything, but rather on her desire to survive.

"How unbelievable, that cunning fox was..."

Glenda was one of the successful cases of the Rosso's secret summonings. Through sorcery, they forced otherworlders to pledge their loyalty to them. They were renowned for their strength and were treated like tactical weapons.

And someone as capable as Glenda was not only defeated, but captured. Johann couldn't believe that was the case. He was a mere mortal despite his position among the Five Great Elders. Unlike Granbell and Mariabell, he could only process human logic.

Ignoring Johann, Mariabell began to strategize.

*There's no way we can defeat him, but perhaps I can dominate him.*

That would have to do. Mariabell made up her mind.

"---I'm setting up a trap."

"A trap? What do you plan to do?"

Johann had been passive for the most part until now. This was the first time he asked Mariabell a proper question.

"Yes, a trap," Mariabell said as she turned to Yuuki. "Aren't you and your subordinate going to explore some ancient sites with Demon Lord Rimuru? I will set it there."

It was not merely a confirmation; it was her order.

"Yes, Kagali is going, but it may be dangerous!"

"What do you mean?"

"Demon Lord Milim is coming as well, that's why setting up a trap there would be dangerous," Yuuki advised.

He believed that they should try to win Demon Lord Rimuru's trust this time. The plan needed to aim for the long term.

However, Mariabell had made her decision.

"No no. Given more time, that demon lord would only become more difficult to deal with. That's what my instinct tells me. Yuuki, can you prevent Demon Lord Milim from coming?"

"There is no way. They seemed to be suspecting me. At this point if I were to reject her, it would be the equivalent of me confessing that I'm the villain."

"You have a point, then we shall take care of Demon Lord Milim as well."

"Ah?"

"This is madness! This is not merely reckless, you don't even have any card to play here, Mariabell!"

Yuuki listened to Mariabell's words in disbelief, while Johann stood up to oppose them.

That was only natural. To defeat a single demon lord alone was already something to be cautious about. Yet now she wanted to deal with two demon lords at the same time. This was essentially driving the chance of success down to zero.

Yet Mariabell was still smiling.

"We've got to give it all we have and go all-out!"

"No, that won't do! Even if I were to give it your all, my subordinates, the Moderate Clown Troupe, they are currently unavailable. Moreover---"

"I'm not sure how strong they are, but they can't help if they aren't around---"

Yuuki's retort was cut short by Mariabell. To her, the Moderate Clown Troupe was nothing.

No, actually.

That was because Mariabell had laid eyes on a power much stronger---something that was strong enough to combat the demon lord.

"---However, Yuuki, I did ask you to get me 'a certain something' from the 'Dragon's Nest.' That can be useful now."

"'Certain something'---could you be referring to that?! You want to use that thing? No way! That's something even I can't control!"

"No problem. That thing belonged to Demon Lord Milim anyway, we are just giving it back to her. That's how the plot will go, Demon Lord Clayman kept that thing as his trump card, and it was utilized by the remaining force of his faction. That way, Demon Lord Milim won't get mad at us."

"This may end up inflicting great harm on humans as well..."

"And?"

"N-nothing..."

Johann brought this up in the hope of changing Mariabell's mind. Yet she disregarded it with the wave of a hand. She may have given it some thought if he had some other plan to suggest, but that alone was not enough to pique Mariabell's interest. Moreover, Johann couldn't think of an alternative plan anyway. Mariabell's plan was therefore finalized.

While Johann was continuing his meaningless struggle, Yuuki tried to understand Mariabell's thought process. In the end, he realized that this plan had a higher chance of success than he had first imagined.

"...It makes sense. With that, we can draw Demon Lord Milim away to fight her own battle. Rimuru-san wouldn't be able to intervene, it would be great to isolate the demon lord."

"Hehehe, smart boy, how very smart. And while Demon Lord Milim is distracted by that toy---"

"We will focus on controlling Rimuru-san, is that correct?"

"Yes, that's the idea."

"But I have one concern."

"You mean the Storm Dragon?"

"---Impressive, indeed. If we fail to dominate Rimuru-san and cause Veldora to lose control, what should we do?"

If their target resisted more intensely than imagined, and they had no chance of controlling him, Yuuki would have to kill Rimuru. Yuuki was afraid that things would lead down that path, and tried to hint at the possibility. Yet Mariabell seemed to have expected this as well.

"You don't have to worry about that, Yuuki. There's no need for you to worry about anything. Just focus on how to defeat Demon Lord Rimuru."

Yuuki was unable to disobey Mariabell. He could only follow her order.

"---I understand. If you say so, I shall trust you."

Mariabell nodded after hearing Yuuki's answer.

![break]

Mariabell had a thorough understanding of the affairs in this world. It came from everything Great Elder Granbell had taught her about demon lords.

If Demon Lord Rimuru were to be eliminated, Storm Dragon Veldora would start ravaging the land. Surely, Demon Lord Luminas would figure out a way to deal with the Storm Dragon.

No, paradoxically, that would be better than allowing Demon Lord Rimuru to exploit the current affairs.

Demon Lord Rimuru and Demon Lord Luminas formed an alliance. This meant that Demon Lord Luminas had handed the running of the Western Nations over to Demon Lord Rimuru.

The Queen of Nightmare that saw humans as mere food had until now, handed that mission to the Seven Luminary Clerics.

Yet, it did not last.

With the fall of Granbell, the Seven Luminaries had fallen as well. Granbell lost the protection of Demon Lord Luminas and could no longer reign over the Western Nations in her name.

Surely, in the future, the power of Hinata the Saint would only increase. By manipulating Hinata, Demon Lord Rimuru's system of domination would be set in stone...

*I cannot allow that to happen. And for that cause, I'd subject the whole world to the threat of Veldora*---Mariabell made her resolve in her heart.

![break]

After this, Mariabell and Yuuki paired up to initialize a detailed attack plan.

At this point, Johann had no room to intervene. He could only pray for the success of their plan.

Thus, the majins cautiously planned out their malicious assault to eliminate Rimuru.

![hard scene break]
After the lengthy meeting, we met up at the café.

Changing out of the suit, I was back in my casual clothes. Since our business here was done, I could just use 'Spatial Movement' to go back home. But Souei had not brought back the culprit yet. Afraid that something may have gone wrong, I decided to stay a little longer.

By the way, the meeting was super tiring.

The prince of Ingracia, Elric, forced his way in mid-meeting. There was also that middle aged man, Gavan, pulling the strings. Moreover, there were all those councilors who were on their side.

Things ended up in failure, causing all of them to be stunned.

Gavan seemed to be a noble of high standing, yet he was taken away by some dangerous guys called magical inquisitors. The other councilors enjoyed diplomatic immunity, but with the document I provided, their home nations would probably judge them. Disgrace was all that awaited them, no doubt.

They seemed frightened by the gravity of the situation, but they got what they deserved.

Even though I wasn't part of the ruckus, some people were still looking down on me with their noble mindset. If these people were innocent, I wouldn't hold them accountable. However, after taking one look at the ledger, I realized they were all corrupt to the core. That's why I wanted to use this opportunity to punish them and sent the ledger to their home nations.

Now that it had been done, even those rude idiots would get taken care of. Some people used their position as councilors to enrich their personal lives. For the good of the future, it was best to make them disappear.

I sipped on my coffee as I reflected on the meeting.

![break]

"Anyway, a lot of things have happened. Thankfully, Hinata and Shuna got pissed off first. I'm the demon lord after all, it's not exactly appropriate for me to go and deal with them."

"I didn't get pissed off, I just thought that they were rather rude with their diplomatic approach and wanted to teach them a bit about manners."

"Me too, Rimuru-sama. I was merely punishing those rude individuals. If I had really gotten mad, I would have made them disappear from this world, not a speck of dust left."

Hinata and Shuna both gave off a smile. They were so synchronized that it was scary.

To such a ferocious response, I could only nod and reply "A-ah, I see."

![full page image](image10)

"To be honest, this has been a great experience," Benimaru interjected.

"Hmm?"

"It's nothing, but I was so angry that my head went blank and didn't know how to let out the anger. Had Shuna not done anything sooner, I would have burnt every human in that room to ash."

"Phew!" Hearing this, I almost spat out all my coffee.

I thought that Benimaru was just quietly observing on the side. I was even impressed, thinking that he had become more mature. But in reality, he was just so angry that he forgot about himself.

*What a waste of my praise.*

Or perhaps it was a close call. Had I let him go on a rampage, we would have become the nemesis of humanity.

"Oi oi oi, you, do not do something like that, absolutely not!"

"Hahaha, I was just joking!"

Benimaru tried to get past the conversation with his bright laughter, but he couldn't fool me. This guy was serious.

Before the next council meeting, we must nominate a councilor for our nation. I needed to be cautious about the candidate.

![break]

As we chatted, I finished my coffee.

"Rimuru-sama, I have captured the culprit," Souei reported to me.

I knew he would do just fine, it looked like he got the job done. As always, he was so competent and did his job perfectly.

"The culprit was a very strong enemy. She didn't announce her name after I demanded to know, so her identity is still unclear. However, she did call Rimuru-sama 'the master of the asshole demon.'"

Hmm, that was okay. There was no way a professional assassin on a mission would reveal her identity like that.

Though, was the asshole demon she referred to...

"Was she talking about Diablo?"

"I believe so."

*Uh---so that's how it is.*

Diablo didn't report this back to me---but since even Razen was a cheap shot in his book, it was very likely that he didn't feel the need to mention her. At times like this, I was forced to realize, yet again, that Diablo's standards were pretty weird.

That Razen guy was so strong as to be called a Majin. According to Hinata, there wasn't anyone stronger than Razen in the Western Nations. To call someone like that a cheap shot, Diablo had some odd measures. I needed to educate him more about this kind of common sense.

Trying to memorize all these points, I ordered a second cup of coffee.

Shuna, Hinata and Benimaru were having black tea with cakes.

*Uh, Benimaru, even you ordered it?*

In that case, I wanted one too. Fruit cake was the best.

I tried to persuade Souei to order some too, but he ordered "hot coffee" from the staff. The waitress was blushing as she left. Souei didn't seem to notice, drinking the coffee without adding anything.

This guy sure looked handsome just sipping his cup.

While I was feeling a close kinship to Benimaru, who enjoys sweets, I got the detailed report from Souei, the perfect handsome man.

"---That was how it went down."

Souei's report was done by the time I finished the second cup of coffee. I shared everything Souei saw through 'Telepathy Net' with everyone else as well.

It looked like Souei managed to draw out all his opponents' tricks. Even though his target was an amazing beauty, Souei didn't spare any punches.

This kind of reminded me. There was some online game in the past where you could cheat through game exploits. You could change your health points to infinite, giving your opponent the hope of winning while you grinned behind the screen.

*I'm so close to winning*---that was the most sinister thing to make your opponent think. And your opponent would try so hard during the fight, using every last one of their items.

That's exactly what Souei did, but he must have been trying to get relevant information about the culprit.

Fine, this was not a video game we were talking about here. Moreover, espionage was all about testing out what your opponent had in store. So, Souei did nothing wrong. In fact, I should be praising him.

"Good work, Souei, you sure are amazing."

"I tried out some methods I learned from Rimuru-sama; it was surprisingly effective. Indeed, at times, it is important to pretend as though I am having trouble in battle."

*Eh-eh...eh?*

Oh yeah, now that he'd mentioned it, I *did* say something like that to him. I recalled that it might have been the plot of some spy movies...or was it video games? Didn't really matter since I seemed to have forgotten about it.

*Sorry for calling you sinister just now,* I apologized to Souei internally.

"Ahaha, looks like it helped out, how wonderful."

"Not entirely, I am still not strong enough. Three of my 'Clones' were eliminated by her."

"I-is that so? Anyway, now we've got dirt on them."

"Indeed. Please leave interrogation work to me."

*Interrogation, eh? Uh---what to do now?*

While I was mulling it over, Hinata interjected: "I wasn't going to say this, but I imagine this will come out in time anyway, so I'm just gonna bring it up with you guys. Souei-san's opponent, that woman, was one of my subordinates. Although I do not know what sort of power she has hidden, her Skills were surprisingly problematic. No wonder Lamar was beaten. With bullets appearing so close to him, he probably wasn't able to react."

"So, who is this guy called Lamar?"

"Uh, sorry. That guy used to be my subordinate, an ex-'Three Martial Sages.' He lost to that woman called Glenda and became her subordinate."

Maybe Hinata could dodge a bullet that close to her, but most people couldn't. There was no doubting the danger Glenda's Skill posed.

Hinata gave a rough explanation, saying that the assassin's strength was at 'Sage' level, and was strong enough to battle a 'Demon Lord Seed.' No wonder she was that ridiculously strong.

Moreover---

"She sent one of Souei's 'Clones' flying, was she using a grenade?"

"Do you mean the exploding ball?"

"Yes, that's it. It doesn't seem like magic. I assumed that it was a weapon from another world."

<<Answer. It is likely that the individual 'Glenda' used mana to craft it. It may be slightly different, but with Skills such as 'Weapon Specification,' one can construct weapons from memory.>>

*W-weapon specification? So not only does she have sniper skills, she even had a trump card like that?*

By the way, if it was the authentic 'Weapon Specification,' she would've been able to reconstruct weapons from her memory perfectly. Yet what Glenda had recreated didn't seem delicate enough and could only act as a pale imitation. Nonetheless, it still posed a threat.

"I thought so as well. Even though I've not seen the real thing, it was just like how it is described in the movie. In other words, Glenda could be an 'Otherworlder.'"

"I think that may be the case, because she seems to have used her memory to recreate these weapons."

As I proudly explained this, Hinata looked at me suspiciously.

"How do you know that?"

*Uh, busted.*

I had yet to publicly disclose the existence of Wisdom King Raphael-san. Right now, I could only try to play dumb. I shouldn't have pretended that I knew all of these things. I tried to come up with an excuse to deal with Hinata.

"It's instinct! When you reach my level, your instincts become super sharp."

My words evoked looks of admiration from Benimaru and the others. It really warmed my heart, but I also kept on peeking at Hinata.

"Never mind. Putting that aside, can I interrogate her as well? If it is truly Glenda, I have something to ask her. Sare and Grigori both haven't returned. I'm guessing she may know what has happened to them."

*Looks like she ignored me.*

If she had things to ask Glenda, she should go ahead. We weren't going to hide anything anymore, unlike what Shion did last time---that was too *excessive.*

Glenda's claims suggest that she had fought against Diablo in the past, but she managed to run away early on. As for the matter regarding Prince Elric, it actually didn't concern us anymore. That's why, if she was willing to be honest with us, we didn't plan on doing any harm to her.

---Moreover, Souei said that he had already let her have a taste of fear.

Not physically, but mentally. Surely, Glenda's pride must be in tatters.

That said, whether we should let her go was also a difficult choice. She was stronger than we expected, so it would be dangerous to just let her run wild. In any case, it didn't seem right to hand her over to the Kingdom of Ingracia. For now, I figured we should keep her.

"Okay, are you coming with us?" I asked Hinata.

"Then do indulge me," she nodded.

Anyhow, depending on her attitude, we would decide what to do after we checked up on her.

On that note, we decided to switch venues.

![break]

---By the way, I was the one to pay the bill at the café.

Yesterday as well.

I didn't really understand why Hinata slipped her bill to me. Should I forgive her with my generous heart, or should I be salty about it? But then again, I didn't want to be considered stingy.

*To be annoyed by something as minor as this, I must be a petty bourgeoisie.*

On my way home from Ingracia, those were the thoughts running through my head.

![soft scene break]

"Eh, Head Knight---!"

Once we met up with Souei's 'Clone,' we went home together. Glenda, who had been in his custody, woke up as well and shouted upon seeing Hinata.

We were not in some interrogation chamber, but a normal reception hall. Benimaru and Souei stood guard beside me, and Hinata was there too. Shuna prepared some tea for us to drink while we interrogated her.

"Long time no see, Glenda, you seem well."

Hinata spoke first as she greeted Glenda with a cold eye. She was, as usual, merciless against her enemies. Glenda was rather nervous, but she quickly regained her cool.

"Hmph! Looks like I'm done for, then. Kill me if you must. When a spy is captured, it always ends up like that, one way or another."

She still managed to say something like that without shame.

"Silence. You shall only answer Rimuru-sama's questions."

Souei pointedly said without any trace of sympathy.

"Rimuru-sama, shall I cut off this woman's limbs as punishment to make her behave better?"

*Please don't.* Souei was really going to do that.

"No no no, even though we have healing potions---"

"I see, so you are saying that we should make her feel pain a couple of times? I didn't know that's---"

"No! I wanted to say that we shouldn't overdo it even *with* the healing potions!"

*Seriously, could you not?*

Even though Shuna was agreeing with a smile, Hinata was eyeing me hard.

I didn't intend to do that kind of thing to a woman. Moreover, Glenda didn't seem so stubborn as to not reveal anything. Perhaps with negotiation, we could get her to reveal the truth.

"Then, Glenda-san. Nice to meet you, I suppose? I'm Demon Lord Rimuru."

"---Hello. I am Glenda. Subordinate to Hinata-sama over there, one of the 'Three Martial Sages.'"

Glenda seemed to understand that there was no use retorting to Souei or trying to negotiate. Perhaps she felt it would just be better to answer my questions, starting off straight-forward by introducing herself.

Glenda knew Diablo, so I figured that she must have escaped knowing she wouldn't win. Even among those people who vigorously asked for their lives to be taken, few earnestly wished to die. I was sure that she still had a strong will to survive.

I was also curious about why Glenda betrayed Hinata. Even if she didn't reveal the identity of the employer behind this assassination, she might reveal some other information. In any case, I didn't know the extent to which she would come clean, so let's just ask as many things as we could.

![break]

After settling down with that idea, I posed the first question in a calm tone.

"You were going to assassinate Prince Elric, is that correct?"

"Yes."

"You were going to create the illusion that it was my doing to chase us out of the Western Nations, is that why?"

"Perhaps. I didn't ask for the reasons. Someone just ordered me to do that."

I see, she didn't seem to be lying.

"Can I ask the next questions?"

Hinata's question made Glenda tense up nervously.

"What are you going to ask?"

"I put you in charge of the business hub cities, gave you the freedom of operating in an environment where you wouldn't be bound, and told you 'not to trust words of merchants' easily. But you were already bribed at that point, weren't you?"

"No comment."

"You were going to betray us from the start, weren't you? Was it from someone's order?"

"---No comment."

"I figure that your employer is probably also running the council behind the scenes, so what's his true identity?"

"..."

"I have been onto you for some time. When the council took action, sometimes, it seemed as though they knew the plans of the Western Holy Church. Obviously, there was a traitor, and you were the most suspicious. I was waiting for an opportunity to take care of you. If you are willing to tell me who your employer is, I may lighten your sentence."

"Didn't I just say? No comment!"

"Is that so? Then let me ask you this one last thing, do you believe in Luminas-sama?"

"Tsk, there's no such thing as God in this world. As opposed to believing that, you might as well believe in money---"

The next second, Hinata unsheathed her rapier. A sharp clang rang out as my sword stopped her rapier.

"Hold on, Hinata! Not her neck. Are you not just interrogating, but actually trying to kill her?"

"---That's not what I have in mind."

"Liar! I can see the bloodlust burning in your eyes!"

Seriously, I couldn't be careless for one second.

Right now, all Hinata wanted was to kill her. Thankfully, I was on guard and able to react, or we could have lost a valuable source of information.

"Don't worry, Rimuru-sama, I can use her to test my resurrection magic," Shuna said with a smile.

"Right, Rimuru. I can also use the god's miracle 'Resurrection.' There is no problem at all."

I couldn't tell if this was all an act or not.

After Shuna, even Hinata said something that outrageous. I suppose it was fine to kill, if you could revive her, but it just didn't sit right with me.

---That's how I felt, but to be honest, I was willing to let them go ahead and do it.

"Anyway, Hinata, let me handle this for a bit."

Time to switch out the contestant.

This was not gonna end well if I were to let it continue. For now, Hinata needed to take a chill pill.

And so, it was my turn again.

*Come on, Wisdom King Raphael-san, it is time for you to shine!*

<<---Understood.>> Raphael-san readily agreed.

I began to quote Raphael-san's words verbatim, "It is futile to ask a professional hitman like yourself to divulge information. Therefore, you merely need to listen to what I have to say."

*Oh, I see.* If we said something to shake her confidence, we could derive some information from her body language?

"Try to keep up your poker face."

"Hah! Don't look down to me like that, it goes without saying!"

*Hmm, Glenda accepted the challenge. So, who is gonna be the winner of this contest?* I thought to myself, as if I were part of the audience.

"Unique Skills are often etched onto one's soul, you are no exception; your Skill is deeply imprinted upon it."

"Huh, that's the first time I've heard of that, so what?"

"Hmm, during the meeting just now, many councilors were corrupted by their 'desire.'"

"Oh..."

"Those 'desires' were forcibly implanted, some Skills can have an influence on one's soul, so I assume they must have been affected."

"..."

"Glenda, you were also affected."

"What do you mean?"

"Luckily you had your Unique Skill protecting your soul, so it wasn't corrupted completely."

"Uh---"

She probably couldn't deny what I said. Glenda glared at me silently.

In fact, that was the first time I heard about it, as well.

"But even for such an impressive Unique Skill, there are still people who can tell its existence."

"---You mean like the 'Appraisal Eye'?"

"Yeah, like Demon Lord Milim's notorious 'Dragon Eyes.' I don't know how it actually works, but wasn't there a rumor that 'Demon Lord Milim can see through everything'? It isn't far from the truth, with a mere glance, Milim can tell what type of Skills her opponent has."

That was true. Though, that said, she couldn't reveal the details of the Skills if her opponent didn't activate them. She could, nonetheless, still tell the strength of her opponent's Skills and identify whether it was an Extra Skill or a Unique Skill.

But when a single person possessed more than two Unique Skills, it became hard to discern whether you were dealing with one extremely powerful Unique Skill, or multiple---the details seemed to be more difficult to obtain.

I had similar Skills myself. The accuracy of my 'Analyze and Assess' had increased, and now I could vaguely read my opponent's Skills. Furthermore, I also learned of ways to counter this and keep mine hidden.

It was like how Guy Crimson disguised his magicule capacity. When I met Guy, I thought that there was no need to actively conceal Skills that I wasn't currently using.

But that was not the case at all. A trained 'Analyze and Assess' could discover what Skills you had.

In retrospect, I was lucky. With my four Ultimate Skills back then, Guy probably saw me as a rival that should not be underestimated.

I could not let 'Wisdom King Raphael' be known to the public. I must act cautiously in the future. I had thought it was impossible to hide your Skills, when in fact, it could be done. With enough practice, I seemed to be able to fool analytical Skills.

Even though it wasn't perfect yet, after experimenting with many things, this was the conclusion.

![break]

"What are you on about? I *do* have a Unique Skill. So how is it that, thanks to it, I haven't been corrupted by 'desire'?"

I had paused for a second, when Glenda asked anxiously.

She probably couldn't help but ask, after hearing that she had been under the influence of 'desire.'

I wanted to answer her quickly, but Raphael-san's explanation was a bit too difficult. It was taking some time to digest the information before regurgitating it.

<<Proposal. Activate 'Thought Acceleration'? YES/NO>>

I forgot this was available. I wished I had used that from the beginning; I quietly chose YES.

From here on out, we moved on to the speed round with Glenda.

"Whether you have been corrupted by desire or not, is none of my business, but there's one thing I can say for sure from this. Your employer has a very powerful Unique Skill. Am I correct?"

"No comment---even though I want to say this, I have to admit that you are correct."

"Thank you. Then let us continue. There was a guy who was corrupted by 'desire' during the nation founding festival as well. That man's name was Gai. He was defeated by Shuna today. Only a few of the merchants were affected while the rest of the guests remained fine. In order to spread the influence to multiple individuals, I figure the probability of the caster being present in close proximity was very high."

"..."

It may be a different case for someone as completely corrupted as Gai, but as the distance increased, the effect of the Skill would weaken.

Masayuki's Skill was very strong too. However, it had a synergistic effect mostly due to the power of the rumor mill. From the basis of his Skill, rumors spread his influence further even without his notice.

However, the effect of 'desire' purely relied on the power of the Skill. You could probably intensify the influence with the clever use of sophistry and the like.

To put it simply, it was highly likely that this individual had attended the nation founding festival. This did make a lot of sense. In this way, I could only think of one suspect. I had found the individual suspicious for some time and had asked Souei to investigate.

"Mariabell Rosso, have you heard of the name?"

Raphael-san sure was straight to the point. It picked out the name directly from Souei's investigation report.

"---UH!"

Seemingly trying to conceal information till the bitter end, this was the only reaction Glenda made.

It must have meant that she knew something.

"My 'Analyze and Assess' is pretty good. Not only can I detect Skills, I can also see when someone is trying to hide something. Plus, I sensed an unusual presence during the nation founding festival. And one of them was this young girl called Mariabell."

Glenda's face looked worse as she listened to my words. Cold sweat seemed to be dripping down her cheeks, or was it just normal sweat? Either way, Glenda looked very nervous.

"H-how did you---"

"You said Mariabell Rosso?" Hinata interjected once more, cutting off Glenda. "Rosso---it must be the Rosso family. So that's how it was."

"EHH!"

Normally, she would have been mad after I told her not to speak. Yet from her expression, that didn't seem to be the case. After all, the line "All of the mysteries have been solved" was written on Hinata's face.

Besides, it was obvious from Glenda's attitude that something was amiss.

"Granbell Rosso. He is the progenitor of the Rosso family. He was a great man that used to be a Hero. Glenda, surely you knew this as well, that the true identity of the leader of the Seven Luminary Clerics, the Sun Sage, was Granbell---"

As expected, it looked like Hinata had arrived at the truth.

Her words have revealed the people behind this whole ordeal and their specific role in the matter.

"You meant the Seven Luminaries, those people from before? I heard that they were all killed, so that guy called Granbell is still alive?"

"Nicolaus said that he has sent him six feet under, but that strange man has led the Western Holy Church for over hundreds of years. It wouldn't be strange if he had managed to escape his certain death."

Mariabell seemed to be the caster of the 'desire' Skill.

There was also the Great Elder Granbell Rosso---no, the head of the Seven Luminaries, Gran.

I see, if Granbell really was this monster that had lived for hundreds of years, then the likelihood of him dominating the council was very high.

"So, Gran is behind all this?"

"It must be him. He's probably manipulating powerful individuals such as Mariabell in an attempt to achieve something?"

We ignored Glenda at this point and began to share what information each of us had our hands on.

The answer to the mystery was almost out.

Glenda had no more value to us.

"Dammit! I didn't say anything, how come you all know so much! What kind of joke is this, isn't this the same as me revealing everything---!"

*Umm---what bad luck. I can only say that you have met too strong an opponent.*

*Wisdom King Raphael-san is ridiculously competent, it's not someone you can hope to rival.*

"Even if you think that way, it can't be helped."

"That's okay, Glenda. You meet a traitor's end, and deservedly so."

"Damnit, if this continues, I-I'm gonna die..." Glenda moaned, her face now ashen.

I started to feel bad for her. I didn't really plan to kill her. I was thinking about handing her to the Kingdom of Ingracia after getting the information, but surely, she would be executed now.

I thought Glenda would be able to escape, but seeing how scared she was, the person pulling her strings must've been very powerful.

"Is this Mariabell really that strong?" I asked out of curiosity.

"---That's not the issue. 'Summoned Ones' like us are shackled by a curse that prevents us from disobeying. Therefore, if our summoners thought that we had betrayed them, they would crush our souls. That will be my end."

*Ah, that's just...*

"So, you weren't betraying Luminas-sama out of your own free will, it's just that you can't disobey?"

"About that, it's more complex than you think. I wanted to beg for mercy from God, but Granbell-sama's eyes were sharp and saw everything. To be honest, I had no choice."

Hearing this, I felt an inkling of sympathy towards Glenda.

Hinata was still glaring at her coldly, but her fury didn't appear as intense as before. Her killing intent seemed to have subsided.

"Indeed, there is no use seeking refuge in God, either. People with their soul shattered cannot be resurrected."

*Ah ah, so Hinata has her kind side as well.*

Even though she still seemed cold, she was actually thinking about ways to save Glenda.

*I wonder, could I unbind the curse?*

<<Answer. No problem, do you wish to lift it? YES/NO>>

*Ara, here we go.*

And so, we undid the curse with ease.

![soft scene break]

"It's all over. That girl---Mariabell---can read all my emotions. Even if I had no intent of betraying her, she will still know and eliminate me," Glenda lamented regretfully.

Seeing her in this mood, I told her that the curse has been destroyed.

"Wh...what now?"

"Anyhow, don't worry about it. We are done with you and you can live your life freely. They probably think you are dead as well."

"N-no, that's not it. You managed to unbind the 'curse' that dominated me?"

"Umm, sort of. I'm not going to further elaborate. Just remember that I won't be so kind in the future if you stand against us."

"I suppose I will turn a blind eye as well. I'd catch a lot of flak for harming people released by Rimuru. However, remember this. You betrayed Luminas-sama, the Western Holy Church will never forgive you."

Glenda was strong and posed quite the threat. Despite this, now that she was no longer under Mariabell's control, there was no reason why she would antagonize us.

If she were to insist on remaining hostile towards us, I would just take care of her in time. I didn't feel all that troubled by her actions, so I decided to forgive her this time.

Hinata also seemed to have decided to let Glenda off the hook. Since I had forgiven her, she probably couldn't do something that meant otherwise.

In some sense, Glenda was merely following orders. She was not making decisions herself, but was acting under the restrictive control of the 'Curse.' Therefore, we should be light with her punishment.

"That's all, you are free to go. Feel free to stay in our nation if you feel like it, but if you were to cause any trouble---"

"W-wait a minute---no, please hold on a second! Are you really letting me go?"

"Umm, killing you doesn't seem all that meaningful."

"Since Rimuru-sama is letting you live, we don't have any reason to oppose the idea."

"You alone won't pose too much of a threat anyway," Souei and Benimaru added on to my words.

Even though the way they put it was rather off, they seemed to be okay with this verdict. They probably felt that Glenda posed no threat. While that may sound harsh, it was, in truth, the reality of the situation. She didn't stand a chance against a serious Souei, and she obviously wouldn't win against Benimaru. Glenda herself seemed to be mindful of keeping her life. She wouldn't be stupid enough to challenge someone she couldn't beat. That was why we were fine with letting her go.

Facing me, Glenda suddenly dropped to her knees.

The words she then spilled were shocking.

"I-I have a request! I will tell you everything I know, so can you please hire me? I'll do any dirty work you have, anything, please!"

Hearing this, Benimaru and I looked at each other, dumbstruck.

*What should I do?*

*It's your call.*

We were exchanging information with our eyes.

Even if she wanted us to hire her, we didn't really have the money. My pocket money had increased by a lot, but we were still reviewing our executives' paychecks.

We were a super sweat-shoppy corporation---I mean nation.

"Uhh---I'm glad to hear your enthusiasm, but we are still developing. We are slow in terms of designing systems, so there is no salary for now..."

You gotta be clear when it came to this type of question. It wouldn't help if I were to act rich, so I told her the truth.

"---Eh?"

Glenda was frozen in disbelief.

Be that as it may---what Glenda said next shocked us instead.

"Oh, I'm used to that already. Even though I was a member of the Pope's Imperial Order and a member of the Holy Empire of Lubelius, I wasn't getting paid anyway..."

I didn't expect that someone with such high status as the 'Three Martial Sages' wasn't even getting paid.

As it turns out, everything was paid with actual goods; any money they had, was collected by themselves. However, they could use their reputation to get a national guest level of treatment in the Western Nations. They could also receive prizes for stopping crimes, and overall, it sounded like they were well off.

"Eh, does that mean Hinata hasn't collected much money either?"

*But didn't she spend a ton during the festival?*

"---Tsk, yeah. In Lubelius, we promote the idea that everyone is equal, so we won't pay in cash in public trades. Everyone just uses goods as currency."

I was surprised, but also reassured. If a kingdom as long-lived as Lubelius could work without paying salaries, surely, we were not in a hurry to design our own systems.

By the way, Hinata was in charge of running the Holy Knight Order, with the additional role as the head knight of the imperial order. She seemed to be able to access the national treasury to some extent. With the additional earnings from fulfilling monster contracts throughout the day, she could earn plenty of money.

"So, you are still asking me to pay even when you are making so much money?"

"Why do you care so much! It's called being frugal, frugal!"

She was willing to spend money treating the kids but was super stingy with me.

By the way, have I given any bonus to Myourmiles?

I thought to myself, but I figured it would be too much trouble and decided not to dwell on it.

"Despite how I look, I'm quite infamous among the Western Nations," Glenda exclaimed. "That's why, even if you let me go, I probably won't find a single job offer. After all, most nations probably wouldn't dare to hire me. The adventurer lifestyle doesn't really suit me either. Moreover, this place probably has the highest level of culture around. I'll be satisfied if you just provide me with the basic necessities," Glenda said with apparent desperation. She didn't seem to be lying.

This did seem reasonable. No matter how you saw it, a 'Martial Sage' who was chased out of Lubelius would appear to be a traitor to the world's eyes. There was no way any nation would dare to hire someone as dangerous as that.

Even if she were to hide her identity and become an adventurer, it would still be a life of unending fear. If she were to expose her identity accidentally, either Lubelius or Granbell would likely send people after her.

Either way, she wouldn't be able to live a peaceful life.

"That's true, you probably will have a hard time surviving if no one wants to help you."

"Tell me about it. So please, Demon Lord-sama! You may not believe me, but I swear I'll pledge my loyalty to you!"

*How could I believe you?*

But to be honest, you couldn't exactly hate her. She was like the unfortunate woman that appeared in the spy movies. You just couldn't leave her behind.

"Souei, can you handle this?"

"If Rimuru-sama wishes so, I will not object."

"Then I'll be counting on you. It'll be troublesome if she were to betray us, so please prepare accordingly."

"Understood. Her combat prowess outshines Souka, therefore she can be under my command and help expand our secret services."

"A secret service that exclusively recruits problem children?"

"Well, sort of. I want to use what is available in front of me as opposed to spending the effort recruiting otherwise."

Even Diablo had gone to search for subordinates. It would be unfair to stop Souei now.

So I let him go ahead.

"Then you shall handle this in its entirety! Discuss with Myourmiles about your budget."

"Understood!"

The matter was settled quickly.

"Oi, how can you call me a problem child when I'm right here..." I heard Glenda muttering.

*If you have a problem with that, try winning over my trust first.*

And just like that, I decided to recruit Glenda.

![soft scene break]

I asked Souei to manage Glenda, but before that, I needed her to give us all the information she knew. Since this was no longer an interrogation, we simply had a normal conversation over dinner.

"You grab one of these wooden tags with the type of meals written on it and exchange it for food at the window over there. There are three different types of meals, which we switch up every day. There are special meal sets as well. If you were to become an officer of some sort, you can order any food you like."

"Eh, is that so? They have been preparing meals for me every time?"

They always seemed to have a lot of fun eating, but had never used the wooden tag to order anything. But this was the lieutenants' canteen, someone would prepare meals for them even if they didn't order anything.

The creation of new dishes by Shion's and Gobichi's own kitchens was a story for another day.

"This is our most popular dish. You need to make an appointment using your effort points or come early to wait in line to get it. It's a specially made dish," Shuna explained with a smile.

I was gonna say that the dessert in the combo made it seem very extravagant. I realized why that was the case after hearing her explanation.

"We can all have this set."

"Yes. We've ordered people to reserve them for us."

I saw that Benimaru and Souei both were ordering the special meal. I was caught on the fact that Souei just said something about 'Ordering people to reserve them.' Could it be that he had ordered his subordinates to wait in line for him? I should probably just believe in the idea that he wouldn't be stupid enough to order people to fight over meals at the canteen.

With the meals served to our table, we began to dine.

"Now then, let's talk---"

I turned to Glenda as I was about to ask her something. There I saw that her eyes had lit up and all her attention was focused on the meal.

It was really delicious. No wonder it was listed as a special. I supposed it was best to talk about happier topics during the meal. So I questioned her after we ate.

![break]

After we finished dining.

"I used to put money above all, but that thought was changed today. From today onward, I'm gonna live for points!"

*Just to clarify, in case you were being serious, they are not that easy to collect.*

But, fine, whatever. If it made her put in her best efforts, I'd say *go for it*.

"What secrets do you know? Do not hide anything, tell us everything," Souei prompted Glenda, which finally got her to open up about the secrets she knew.

The contents she revealed gave us a surprise.

First, regarding the council. It was under the control of the five leaders of an organization called the Five Great Elders. The head of the Five Great Elders was the aforementioned Granbell.

As for the remaining four, to our surprise, we learned that today's prime suspect, count Gavan, was one of them. And in contrast, the duke of the Kingdom of Rostia, Johann, was also a member of the Five Great Elders.

"How come the Five Great Elders were in disagreement with each other?"

"That was Mariabell's plan. She intentionally organized an opposition while also keeping someone aligned with the majority view. In truth, this was her faking disputes, but to the people involved, this was a real battle where the stakes were life or death."

I see... Was she doing so to make her organization more effective?

At first, it could seem to be efficient to make an organization with one sole goal. However, it was likely to eventually stagnate and become a breeding bed of corruption.

For example, it was often seen that one bad leader could bring down a whole business.

Also, if Johann managed to win my trust, it would've been easier for them to keep tabs on me. For them, it would have been great if they were able to eliminate me, but now, they would probably make plans for Johann to conspire from inside the council.

"That feels so shady."

"I seriously don't want to deal with these people, I want to burn them all."

It was annoying just to hear about these kinds of things.

This was probably how the nobles operated, to eliminate people whose alignment was unclear. I might have trusted Johann if I had not heard about this information. It was the correct choice to have absolved Glenda.

The other two members of the five were the count of Cidre, who was in charge of guarding the northern border of the Kingdom of Ingracia, and King Dolan, who was from a small kingdom in the west. His nation was a military nation guarded by soldiers of the Dolan family.

With these two power houses stationed in Ingracia, it was obvious how much thought Granbell had put into the structure of this land. It was next to the Holy Empire of Lubelius and far from the Great Jura Forest. It would be the safest place on this continent. Granbell thought it was the most suitable location to act as the center hub of politics and economy.

"But why is he antagonizing me? I'm such a friendly demon lord, after all," I blurted out without thinking, and, for whatever reason, everyone looked at me with surprise.

"Eh? With all of the provocations you've issued, it's enough to turn anyone against you."

*What?*

"I thought you were provoking them as well. Diablo mentioned that Rimuru-sama wishes to dominate the world economy. I thought that you were going to control the council as well."

*What do you mean? Also, you were discussing that with Diablo?*

"I thought so too, and figured intelligence gathering was a part of that."

*Yeah, I can't deny that it was one of the goals.*

"...Surely it can't be that you have been doing this unconsciously the whole time?"

*Even Hinata is saying so!*

I never knew this was how everyone thought of me.

"N-not at all. Although I can't deny that I had absolutely no intention to do that, I also wasn't that anxious to get it done! That's why I wanted to negotiate peacefully with others..."

Hearing my excuse, Hinata let out a stunned sigh.

"I doubt there are any good-natured merchants that would allow some new guys to just come around and mess with their trades, don't you think?"

*Uh, she has a point.*

"I-it's all right. We will probably have to confront each other at some point. Let's work towards controlling the economic activities of the Western Nations from now on!"

"I had that idea in mind from the very start. However, my duty is to fortify defense."

"I shall go investigate the Rosso clan and the Five Great Elders."

It was a good thing to be able to see our enemies clearly.

As our new companion, Glenda, said: "You guys sure are lucky to have gotten all this for free." Now we knew what to work towards from now on.

"Okay, you guys should be cautious as well. Pay extra attention. Don't accidentally get sandwiched by Yuuki and the Rosso clan."

"Understood."

Benimaru nodded as Souei also agreed.

We still needed to wait on Yuuki's side while we fought an intelligence and economic warfare against the Rossos. We didn't have to shed any blood for now, so it was relatively more relaxed.

There was a part of me that felt as though I was worrying too much, so I decided to end the conversation.

"Hold on," Hinata suddenly interjected. "Yuuki and the Rosso clan? Why are you cautious about Yuuki?"

I was confused for a second and quickly realized that I had forgotten to bring this matter up to Hinata's attention.

"It's nothing. It's just that I thought about it a lot, and the only person I could come up with who knew about my identity as a 'Reincarnated One,' my relationship with Shizu-san, and is able to leak this information to the eastern merchants, was---"

"Right, only Yuuki fits the bill?"

"Umm, that's right. By the way, that majin called Laplace from that moderate clown gang, I'm guessing that Roy, who was pretending to be the demon lord, may have been beaten by him. No guarantee though."

"It's all right, thanks anyway. I'm not interested in that matter, but I can't just sit back and watch if he's hostile against us."

It looked like Hinata was treating Laplace and the others as enemies. She gave off a chillingly cold laugh.

*Oooh, how horrifying.*

I really had to watch myself to not piss off Hinata.

![break]

After disclosing what I discovered to Hinata, she stood up and made an effort to leave---

"U-uh, about that..." Glenda opened up timidly.

It looked like she had something else to say to me.

"What is it? Feel free to speak what's on your mind. Did you just remember something?"

Just as I finished asking, Glenda dropped the bombshell of the day.

"You were talking about the leader of the Freedom Association, Yuuki, weren't you? That guy's connected to the Five Great Elders Johann. He's completely under the control of Mariabell."

*Eh? Yuuki is being controlled?*

"Is this true?"

"I'm not bold enough to make jokes under these circumstances."

*I suppose so.*

"---Eh, why didn't you say something so important earlier?!"

"W-well, technically speaking, I am Granbell's direct subordinate..."

There were two people who had authority over Glenda. They seemed to be Granbell and Mariabell. And Glenda's orders mainly came from Granbell. Therefore, Glenda never really had the chance to guess Mariabell's thoughts.

I wasn't sure if Glenda knew anything else. She claimed she told us everything she knew.

With that, I heard Mariabell had subordinates known as the 'Blood Shadows' who specialized in doing the dirty work for the Rossos.

"But," Shuna mumbled, "there's another problem now. If Yuuki was manipulated, he may have leaked secrets of Rimuru-sama involuntarily."

Hinata also fell deep into her own thoughts. It looked like we needed to re-evaluate the situation.

<<...>>

*How rare, even Raphael-san fell silent. This is really rare*, *if even Raphael-san can't find the answer, then maybe it's no use for me to bother.*

Right now, the most important thing was to let the thought go.

Since I couldn't figure out anything now, I would just think about it at another time. Just like during the exams, it would be better to put harder questions on hold and solve them later. You shouldn't waste all your valuable time.

"Anyways, let's list Yuuki as a suspect and see what happens next---eh, hold on?"

Yuuki always acted very cautiously, so he probably wouldn't do anything to us on his own. However, it would be different if he had been manipulated by someone else. If his controller were Mariabell, who wished to antagonize us, wouldn't that just topple everything we assumed before?

"If I may, if Yuuki can't disobey Mariabell's orders, is it possible that he would disregard his own stance and do something unnatural?"

*Yes, that was it.*

Mariabell wanted to eliminate all of us. So, she could utilize Yuuki to plot against us. In other words, we would most likely be cornered.

"Doesn't that make things pretty bad for us?"

"They will need to collect intelligence, so the Rosso clan probably won't do anything, however..."

"Nii-san and Souei have a point. Aren't you going to go explore some ruins with the vice president of the Freedom Association, Kagali-san? Perhaps they have some devious scheme behind it..."

Umm, it seemed as though everyone shared the same view.

We might have been too optimistic about our situation.

"There's no need to worry about that---it's too early to say anything. Mariabell---the Rosso clan---they would sever ties with Yuuki and claim that they had no idea about his actions. They could push all of the blame to the Freedom Association and let us fight it out with them."

"---That way, Rimuru-sama's plan would be compromised."

"If we were to just observe, we may lose our chance to strike first."

Umm---with that being said, we were already very cautious. The town was heavily guarded, and it wouldn't be easy to instigate our residents, either.

*If that is the case...*

<<Proposal, we can intentionally show weak points to lure out the enemies.>>

*That's it!*

"Should we cancel the ruin exploration?" Benimaru proposed. I shook my head in response.

"No, we can use this to our advantage. If we were to cancel it, Milim would be super annoyed. Let's proceed as planned, but we should be prepared to confront our enemies no matter what happens."

Milim seemed to be looking forward to the expedition. It was like a hike where she could temporarily escape from her homework. Cancelling it now would likely anger her. That would be troublesome. If possible, I wouldn't want to cancel the expedition either.

"Wouldn't it be dangerous?"

"Milim would come. I also want to bring Shion as my bodyguard."

"Okay, that's no problem. Shion wasn't too happy about staying behind this time. This would surely cheer her up."

Since Benimaru had no problems with the plan, Shion would be my bodyguard.

"I will also bring Gobta and Ranga along. Shouldn't that be enough force?"

"Understood. Leave the town's security to me in case anything happens during Rimuru-sama's departure."

"I will help Nii-san. First, I will fortify the 'Barrier.'"

"I will be in charge of surveillance and see if anyone acts suspiciously in the different nations. Especially the Five Great Elders mentioned by Glenda."

"I'll be counting on you guys. Veldora is in the labyrinth; ask him for help if anything were to happen."

As I finished, everyone nodded in agreement.

"Then I will report back to Luminas-sama. You are really careless sometimes, so be extra cautious."

"You talk too much!"

After she finished chatting with me, Hinata used magic to return home. Even though she was usually very cold, Hinata would occasionally show some care for me in her own way.

*Is this what a tsundere is?*^[The source here states 'これが、デレか,' which mean, "Is this what they call 'dere.'" This is a reference to 'dere dere,' lovestruck, I initially thought the text means Rimuru thought Hinata is a tsundere (someone who is initially cold and rude but gradually showing affection to others), and her caring for him is an expression of the 'dere' part of tsundere, but considering the later context, it can also be interpreted that Rimuru just thinks that Hinata has a crush on him. Take either as you wish.]

<<Answer, no.>>

*Ah, yeah, totally.*

I was daydreaming a bit, but oh the cruel reality.

Anyways, our plan was settled.

All we had to do was to be prepared for action when the day arrived.
