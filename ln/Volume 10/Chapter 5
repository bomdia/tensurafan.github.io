# Chapter 5: The Trap|of Greed

I gathered all of my lieutenants and shared the information with them.

I also introduced Glenda to everyone. Of course, this also meant that she was under surveillance from now on. Glenda would have to win our trust through her own effort in the future.

I introduced her to Kaijin and Kurobee as well and let them inspect Glenda's pistol. Now, they could probably help supply some ammo for her.

*Perhaps we could end up mass-producing pistols?*

I really wanted to own guns, to be honest, but I had no interest in letting them flow freely in the market. Instead, I would only distribute it to important people through a license system.

It looked very cool, so I wanted one.

As I was getting dorky with these ideas, time passed on quickly.

![break]

It was the day to explore the ancient ruin. Everything was ready.

I looked great in my explorer outfit. I even had a prototype of the pistol. Kaijin took an interest in the matter and used the free time in between his research and made the model. Dold engraved the model and installed a mechanism that could cause small explosions via mana.

Since gunpowder wasn't being used, there was no need to discharge a shell casing. Now all you needed to do was to insert the oval-shaped bullets. Its caliber was around nine millimeters, and you could load sixteen rounds. The blowback that happened every time you shot had the purpose of reducing the sudden recoil of firing as well as chambering the next bullet.

It was crafted like a toy, but its power could rival that of a .44 magnum. This was all because of the magisteel that was used to craft the gun, allowing it to withstand a high enough impact. The engravings that delivered the magical explosion were tuned to the maximum force possible, which is what granted the weapon its devastating power.

Different types of ammo had different magnitudes of power. Under normal circumstances, one could use the plain lead bullet. The mithril bullets, which were enchanted with mana, were specially made to deal with monsters. The amount of mana infused would change the strength of the bullet, meaning the weapon was highly adaptable depending on what target you were fighting.

The weapon's rating was rare-grade, but it could attack with the firepower of a unique-grade weapon. It was an interesting choice of arms for sure.

It even surprised Kaijin and the others who made it. Its power had made us consider listing it as the official gear for our new recruits. However, just as I stated prior, this decision needed to be contemplated carefully. To put it bluntly, it was hardly a noteworthy addition to our arsenal. In a sense, it was just a fanciful weapon.

I was hesitant to make it an official sidearm. The idea was to only lend them out if it was deemed necessary, depending on the circumstances.

Yep, like this time.

The right gear is what gave us a certain flare.

Pursuing the fantastical is man's aesthetic^[Refer to previous explanation of 'Men's romance'].

"This thing looks so cool! The recoil after firing also feels super nice!"

Mm-hmm, I see Gobta and I share the same taste.

*I made this to lend to people, but I suppose I can give one to Gobta.*

"You know your stuff, Gobta-kun. But this is very dangerous, so do not point it at people."

"Of course! I will cherish it with my life!"

Gobta seemed delighted. Ranga was watching Gobta enviously.

*But, Ranga-chan, you can't exactly use that gun. That's why I've put this handsome scarf on you, so please forgive me.*

"Hehe, I've got 'Hercules Ex' with the clothes chosen for me by Rimuru-sama."

"Shion, you can't wear that during an exploration. You gotta consider your personal safety."

Shion was so excited about the clothes I gave her that she wanted to try them on at the nearest opportunity. However, those clothes were for fun, not suitable for doing exploration.

"What a pity..."

An upset Shion switched back to her usual suit. That one looked pretty weird as well, but it was Shion's combat suit, so it would have to do.

"Rimuru, how do I look in this?" Milim asked me excitedly.

"Oh, this one suits you well. All the preparation for today has been worth it."

Just like me and Gobta, she switched to the newly made explorer outfit.

"Hmm! This feels so comfortable, I'm so agile in this! It also has so many pockets, it feels so cool!"

Milim was wearing a short-sleeve shirt and shorts. I didn't really feel it was that appropriate, but I figured it'd be fine since it suited her so well.

![full page image](image11)

"That's right, you gotta thank Shuna for that!"

"Whoo!"

"Yeah!"

We were all very satisfied.

And so, we headed off for our destination in high spirits. Our destination was the home base of the Freedom Association located at the capital of the Kingdom of Ingracia. We were planning to meet up with the others and head straight to the Puppet Nation Jistav.

![break]

I didn't even need to go through the headquarters' door, as Kagali-san was already waiting at the entrance.

"Long time no see, thank you for having us today!"

"Nice to meet you, I am Milim."

"Nice to meet you, my name is Kagali. It's a pleasure to see you."

We exchanged warm greetings with a smile as Kagali-san led us to another venue.

"Milim?"

"Uh, nothing's wrong, but, it's just that..."

"...?"

Kagali-san looked confused about our conversation.

She was Yuuki's subordinate, so just in case, we listed her as a suspect. Just now, my conversation with Milim was to have her confirm whether there was anything fishy about our suspect using her 'Dragon Eye.'

Milim seemed to have noticed something strange, but apparently there was no major issue. I still wasn't entirely reassured, so I thought that I'd best stay on guard for now.

"My team has gathered as well, allow me to introduce you to them."

After gazing at us in a rather unexplainable way, Kagali-san began to introduce the teammates.

At the square near the HQ, a line of people was awaiting orders. Kagali-san had trained an exploration team and had hand-picked some of the most outstanding individuals to accompany us during the upcoming exploration operation.

Even though I made it clear to them that we may get ambushed, these people still came nonetheless, almost fearless. They were a mixed group of around ten members. All the passersby were looking at them curiously, but none of the teammates took note of the stares. They looked to be well trained.

Their attire could only be described as "Armed to the teeth."

They were all heavily geared, unlike our "casual equipment."

Covered in very thick and heavy clothes from head to toe, they were carrying all sorts of bulky backpacks. Among their tools, they brought canes, crowbars, shovels, and many other useful items.

"Then, Rimuru-sama, I shall have someone carry your luggage for you. Where have you put it?"

*We didn't bring any luggage, just new clothes.*

"No, we didn't really prepare anything in particular, this will do."

"What? Surely you jest."

*No no no, it's no use telling me that now...*

"It's not a good idea to show your bare skin. With all those bug bites and stuff, you're more likely to get hurt, aren't you?"

The explorer outfits excelled at covering their skin. Sloppy clothing was also a no-go.

"Uh---will it though? My skin's protected by youki, so it shouldn't matter!"

"Umm---but Kagali-san is angry though!"

"You too! In my opinion, your gear is way too light! Both of you are underestimating the exploration business."

*I don't get it. They are nitpicking problems with such a fervor, but what were our mistakes?*

"Ahh, please calm down, it's all right. Despite how I look, I'm actually a fairly experienced adventurer!"

To be fair, since we weren't going camping, it would be fine to wear light clothing. But I didn't need to say it out loud, I'd just show her when the time comes, surely, they would understand.

"Since you say so... However, if you run into any trouble, please tell me immediately."

*We probably won't run into any trouble.*

I only considered this a hike, but I did keep my guard up.

I had also warned Gobta, Ranga, and Shion, as well.

*Now then, let's get on with our hike.*

"Then let's prepare the horse carriages---"

"Eh? Do we really need that?"

Kagali-san gazed at me with a baffled look.

I was confused as well. Because it would take around two months to travel to Jistav by horse-drawn carriage, I didn't intend to do that from the start.

"What do you mean by that?" Kagali-san asked.

I then asked them to move to the outskirts of the city first. Near a less populated area, I opened up a 'Portal' with 'Spatial Domination' to connect to Jistav. I had gotten pretty handy using this now and could link up locations I had already been to very quickly.

"Please go through this. It won't disappear anytime soon, so you guys can walk through just fine."

Upon finishing my sentence, the members of the exploration team who had been watching the outcome in stunned amazement began to stir.

"You gotta be kidding! I don't even know how far it is from here to there..."

"Demon lord... So strong, too strong..."

"This is such overkill. So, all of our preparations have been for nothing..."

I heard these murmurs run through the crows. I suddenly felt pretty bad for them, but also kind of smug myself at the same time.

![soft scene break]

And so, we arrived at the Puppet Nation Jistav.

The dark elf tribesmen came out to welcome us. They lined up in front of the entrance of the castle and bowed deeply to us.

"Welcome to Jistav! You must all be very tired from your long journey?" said the chief^[Or Elder], who was acting as the representative, as she came to greet us. While she was the chief in name, she looked like she was in her twenties. The chief was a female, a blonde beauty with tanned skin, nonetheless.

"Ahh, that's not exactly the case. Oh yeah, have the rooms been prepared?"

"Of course, everyone should get their own room. If need be, we've also prepared a bigger room."

I informed them beforehand that we would visit, but it looked like everything was in order.

*Let's drop the luggage off in the bigger room first, shall we?*

"Let's head to the big room to put down our luggage. Today I wish for you to show us around the castle."

"Understood, please follow me."

With the chief's instructions, we let her guide us to the large room. There I had all the teammates put down their luggage. They did as they were told and put down their luggage in an almost robotic fashion.

"Eh, what just happened? Has it even been an hour since we gathered? We seem to have already reached our destination!"

"This is too bizarre! It's gotta be a trick!"

"Eh, eh? One room per person, eh? Are we being treated as guests in this castle?"

Just now I was saying that they were acting like robots, but it seemed they were just unable to catch up with what was going on. Their heads must've been spinning as their whole world was turned upside-down.

"Rimuru-sama ordered me to take care of everyone here, if you were to experience any inconvenience, there is no need to restrain yourself. Please let us know," the chief said with a gentle smile to assuage the flabbergasted teammates.

That was the moment it clicked for them, and they finally decided to accept the reality of the situation. Seeing them like this, I couldn't help but giggle.

![break]

Afterwards, I took the group to check out the castle with a guide.

As expected from the home base of Demon Lord Clayman, I could only describe it as extravagant. The dark elves were managing the castle with care. Not a speck of dust could be found.

"Milim, when the expedition is over, you will be in charge of this place. However, the local residents asked to continue living here."

"Umm, I know, I will have people deliver food and supplies regularly."

"Thank you, Demon Lord Milim-sama."

"You're welcome. You are my citizens as well; I'm just doing my job."

*Oh oh, even Milim has become an astute ruler. It must all be thanks to Frey-san's efforts.*

Apart from being impressed by Milim, I also asked some other questions, such as whether there would be any inconveniences.

This castle was vast, big enough for all the dark elves to live in. There were no castle towns to speak of. There seemed to be places for majins to live in, but they were all working for Geld now. I heard that the dark elves were managing these residential areas as well, for them to live in the day they returned.

"This is the entrance to the ruins. There are three levels in total, the bottom floor seems to be a tomb. We were only able to enter the upper floor, since for the middle floor and below, only Demon Lord Clayman knew what was held there."

Hakurou also reported that the entrance to the ruins was inside the castle.

"Then have you figured out the layout of the upper floor?"

"Yes, all of the treasure from the upper floor was collected. Right now, we are using it as living quarters."

I heard that there were many empty rooms, enough to easily fit over a thousand men.

![break]

I opened the door and walked straight inside. In spite of this location being underground, it was filled with a gentle glow.

"What is this light---?"

"Your Majesty, this is the permanent effect of magic creation. It seems to be linked with the orbit of the sun as it does get dimmer at night."

"What? So ancient magic is still at work here!"

"Th-this alone should be a major discovery. Even though it's being utilized so naturally, I still want to investigate it thoroughly."

"Then, is there also magic like this present in the middle floor and below as well?"

"Yes, when we sent off Clayman-sama, I secretly had a peek at it. The middle floor was very bright as well."

The chief answered my every question. This lasted for a while.

The exploration team was ecstatic. This excitement must've been contagious, as we began to feel it too.

"Gobta-kun, don't you be a troublemaker now!"

"Understood! But I am feeling a bit nervous."

We talked amongst ourselves in hushed voices as we began to tour the first floor. It was very lively, showing signs that the dark elves really were living down here.

"Won't monsters emerge from underground if you guys were to reside here? The word tomb alone makes me feel that there may be ghosts."

Gobta's question prompted the chief to crack a wry smile.

"No, we wouldn't be concerned about that. There's only one entrance to the underground, and only Clayman-sama was able to open it."

"Oh---then why not just break it if you can't open it!"

"Leave it to me, I'll slash it open right away!"

"No! We have to investigate carefully, not just wrecking things!"

I stopped such an aggressive suggestion.

"Y-you have a point. Let's be careful now, Shion!"

"That was close. I would have cut it down had you not warned me."

This made me feel rather uneasy, but it seemed everything would be fine as long as I explained things well to them.

And so, we headed through the cavernous ruins.

![break]

Passing the residential area of the dark elves, a giant gate appeared before us. Its size was about the same as the first gate. Only this time, the door seemed to have been enchanted with some sort of spell.

"---I see. This appears to have been enchanted with an ancient magic defense mechanism. If you accidentally disturb this contraption, the defensive mechanisms within the city may activate."

"Defensive mechanisms? Are they still functioning?"

"Yes, please be very careful. If we were to trigger it accidentally, we may no longer be able to investigate the ruins," Kagali-san advised everyone with a serious face. The team also seemed rather tense upon hearing her words.

I was more curious about how Clayman opened this gate.

"Is Clayman connected to these ruins in any way?"

"That guy only rose to power recently; he shouldn't have anything to do with such ancient ruins."

"Perhaps he was able to decode the sorcery and open the door with the correct procedure."

Hmm-hmm.

That's right, even if it were Clayman, surely, he would've been able to undo the sorcery with enough time.

*By the way, I recall that Clayman had a Unique Skill as well.*

<<Correct. He possessed Unique Skill 'Manipulator'; he could receive or transmit information in encoded signals.>>

*Yeah yeah yeah, that's it.*

It was some ability about analyzing intelligence, surely, it would be just as simple to analyze magic spells.

*By the way, did I obtain the Skill as well?*

<<Answer. It is an inferior version of master's Skill; thus, it has been decomposed into energy and absorbed. If anything, the Skill 'Ley Line Manipulation' has been added to 'Law Manipulation.'>>

*I see, no wonder it didn't report it to me.*

Because it wasn't worth mentioning. That's why Raphael-san never brought it up. But if Clayman could do it, so could I. Even though this would be Raphael-san doing all the actual work.

"We may be stuck figuring this thing out for a long time."

"We ran headfirst into a mighty challenging task. But our circumstances are already a lot better than what we've done in the past. Let's calm down and analyze it carefully!"

The members of the exploration team talked amongst themselves in a display of motivation.

Ignoring them all, I put my hand on the gate. I instantly got a picture of the energy coming from the 'ley lines' permeating the wall in the form of magic spells.

"I get it now. If we were to destroy this door, the lights on this level would all vanish. All of the energy would be used to repel the invaders before reconstructing itself. It's still functioning normally even after more than a thousand years. Looks like this is a super advanced product born from the magic-wielding civilization."

It was all Greek to me, but thanks to the help of the all-talented Raphael-san, I was able to unravel the matter easily. It was like playing a puzzle game, making it somewhat intriguing.

Like solving an arithmetic problem. I undid the magic expressions one by one and finally found the way to open the gate.

"Ah, there you go. By channeling magic here, we should be able to open the input window of the coded spell."

I finished my sentence only to turn around and see the expedition team with their mouths hanging open.

*Oh snap, I overdid that a bit*---I suddenly realized.

I accidentally started analyzing due to it being so interesting. This was supposed to be their job.

"Sorry, I got ahead of myself..."

"I-it's okay, don't worry about it," Kagali-san said to comfort me, but I still felt that I owed an apology to everyone.

I reflected upon what I'd done while petting Ranga as I patiently waited.

---That's what I should have done. But my own teammates couldn't contain themselves.

"WAHAHAHA! I want to solve it as well!"

"I give up."

Milim started shouting loudly, prancing before the gate, while Gobta couldn't figure out a thing.

That seemed to cheer up the other teammates and they began to discuss. The spark to drive the situation was the question Kagali-san asked, "Rimuru-sama, could I ask you about something? How did you analyze the puzzle?"

By then I was stroking Ranga's fur. But since she'd asked, I couldn't very well withhold an answer. To quench her thirst for clarification, I explained the analysis method in detail.

"First, we need to investigate what sort of magical expressions were used before it came to be, then we could sort those expressions into different stages."

"Do you mean to identify the most recently used magical expression?"

"Right, we then probe what should be removed from the end-product to prevent that magical expression from activating. Repeat this process for the expression before it and so on until you grasp the foundation---that is the underlying flow, the nucleus, of this mechanism. Then, after that, it will conversely give you only the right answers."

"I see..."

"Ruling out false leads and only preserving the expressions that are functioning correctly, is it?"

No wonder why everyone present here was an elite, they immediately understood the method merely from listening to my short suggestion.

"Aren't trap-type expressions complete on their own in many cases? They are like branches and leaves of a large tree that grow close together, parts that do not belong to the central roots and the trunk. This is, assuming that the expressions are not primarily intended to trigger the trap."

"...I see. So even if it's the main stem of the expressions, we still shouldn't let our guard down."

My teaching style seemed to be easy to understand, maybe because I had experience teaching kids. I was pleased to see that it was pretty well received, so I continued to demonstrate more and more of the puzzle analysis.

During this time, Milim opened the gate almost immediately. Later on, a couple of our teammates managed to open the door successfully as well. It was then that the chief called us.

"Everyone, we have prepared meals. You must be tired after your arduous journey; shall we call it a day?"

Having it pointed out, I realized it was already evening.

She had a point, we could begin our exploration officially tomorrow. We would open the gate tomorrow and close up shop for now.

"Shall we stop for the day?"

"I concur. Her saying that we've been on 'an arduous journey' still feels bizarre, nonetheless. We shall begin the investigation officially tomorrow."

With Kagali-san's consent, the day came to a close.

![soft scene break]

The next day.

Our team lined up and prepared for marching. Kagali-san unsealed the gate on our behalf. The blue light flashed repeatedly as the gate silently opened.

"Looks like it was a success."

The folks began to cheer.

"Good job," I praised everyone as I took a step inside the gate.

The middle floor had a different level of luminosity compared to the upper floor. There were candlesticks on the stone walls emitting faint light that couldn't be extinguished. This was some fantastic magic technology. But they were not actual candles, rather, illumination created by magic.

While feeling impressed, I walked towards the floor as Milim came to my side.

"I feel like there's suddenly a really strong sense of oppression here."

"It's true. Because unlike the upper floor, the ceiling is really low, and the hallway is surrounded by stone walls. The passage is really narrow as well, it almost feels like a labyrinth."

The ceiling was only two meters tall. A larger man would have to bend his back. The hallway was only two meters wide as well. It was a bit narrow for two people to stand shoulder to shoulder.

Not like that was a problem for me and Milim due to our petite figures. But the teammates behind us carrying large backpacks may have some trouble doing the same.

"Rimuru-sama, how're things looking ahead?"

If this floor was truly built like a maze, we may have to ponder which road to choose every time we encountered a split. Moreover, there may be traps.

"If there were to be any traps, we'd be able to sense them, so is it okay to allow us to continue leading the team?"

"Are you guys truly able to handle it?"

"Just count on me! With my presence, there's nothing to worry about!"

The person who nodded heavily was Milim, not me.

If no one objects, then we should do just that.

With us leading the charge, Kagali-san and her vice-captain followed. Shion and Gobta were walking at the back of the team to protect the other teammates. Ranga was hidden in my shadow, whereas the chief had stayed behind to stand guard.

I was looking forward to today's supper.

![break]

I used 'Magic Perception' to confirm the status ahead of the road as I casually walked onward. The passages were surrounded by stone walls, which occasionally had murals painted on them. These were some fine drawings.

"They are so beautiful. These murals on their own are already valuable art pieces."

"Is that so?"

"Indeed. Looks like they are depictions of the living conditions in ancient times. We may be able to gain some understanding of ancient civilization. This alone makes it priceless."

"Oh---now that you've put it that way, it does remind me of the sceneries I've seen in the past."

*Ah yes, this by-gone past to me were nostalgic memories for Milim. She must have many feelings passing through here.*

I should try to keep them in their original conditions and be cautious during our investigation.

![break]

The traps that I was worried about did not trigger. The exploration went smoothly.

It was already noon and we decided to rest for a moment.

"Now then, let's prepare lunch."

"Ah, hold up. I asked the chief to prepare bento for us, let's eat that."

I stopped the teammates who were about to start a fire and took out bento for everyone. It looked as if they appeared out of thin air, but I'd actually stored them all in my 'Stomach.' It even kept them warm, what a great Skill for traveling.

"W-well..."

"You can do that?"

Mutters such as these began to spread around, but I ignored all that.

While still feeling confused, the teammates took the bento.

"Umm, this does look very tasty," Milim said happily after opening up the bento.

It was lunch time.

Scrumptious sandwiches with fresh vegetables, eggs and bacon, that was today's lunch.

Speaking of the dark elves' cuisine, their unique sauce was incredible. It tasted like mayonnaise and could even turn crumbly bread soft. And for people who still thought the bread was too tough, they could drink the warm vegetable soup from a large wooden bowl. The stock seemed to have been finely drawn from chicken bones, and it had a rich, savory taste. The vegetables had also thoroughly absorbed the fragrant aroma, and drinking it felt delightfully satisfying.

"No need to hold back, there's more soup for everyone!"

As I finished, some teammates rushed over with their bowls. Milim came in first though, and looked like she really enjoyed the soup.

"It's quite rare to have such delicious delicacies in the wilderness. Everyone must be very pleased about it," Kagali-san said, but she sounded kind of salty.

She was probably implying that I shouldn't get too ahead of myself like this. *I totally get her meaning, but please forgive my little trick this time.*

"I actually didn't want you guys to start a fire here."

"Fire you say?"

"Yes. I didn't want there to accidentally be any fire hazard. Moreover, this is underground. Even though there is air flowing, I just want to be cautious."

"I see that you have foreseen far ahead..."

"I wouldn't mind if we are outdoors."

I was genuine. In truth, this passage was narrow and had no water source. If anything were to happen, we probably would have nowhere to run. That's why I had someone prepare bento.

Also, people would probably need to visit the toilet.

"Ah, I had suspected people would probably want to use the toilet. So, I'm going to open a 'Portal' that connects to the entrance. Everyone, please use the lunch break period to relieve yourself."

I quickly opened the 'Portal' after saying so.

I received a round of baffled stares shouting, "This is insane." But I couldn't just compromise because of that.

Seriously, I was sure they were planning to sneak off in the darker parts of the passageways and get their business done, but I didn't wish them to do so. After all, this was the road leading to a tomb, such sacrilege would just be too much.

"Maybe I'm overthinking it, perhaps the deceased won't mind it after all."

"...No, your way of thinking is admirable," Kagali-san agreed, which I was pleased to hear as well.

![break]

Right, as everyone went to take a toilet break---

"I want to try something, is it okay?"

"Try what? Please do tell."

"Nothing significant, but we are actually running a labyrinth, and right now the most popular strategy has been 'Spirit Communication.' It's a spell that only a shaman or spirit wielder can use, it allows you to find your desired path right away."

"I-is there really magic that convenient?"

Oh, so even Kagali-san didn't know. Actually, it was probably normal that she didn't know anything outside her own specialty.

"U-uh, well! I am a shaman! Can you tell me in detail about this 'Spirit Communication'?"

Oh, wonderful timing.

I was going to say that it wouldn't seem appropriate if I did it myself, this was perfect. A female teammate volunteered herself, saying that she could use 'Spirit Magic.' I then explained 'Spirit Communication' to her.

"Ah, I see. I understand now!"

She was skilled in the attribute of 'Wind,' and her communication with the spirit was very successful.

"Woah, now we won't get lost! If we were to continue, we will meet a dead end, we should go back to the crossroads three blocks behind them on the way back and take a turn to the east. But it's gonna be a huge project to construct the map..."

That's true. The caster would be exhausted after hearing the voice of the spirit for a prolonged period of time, so it was better to draft a map.

In my case, Raphael-sensei would handle all that for me. It could print out the map and draft it almost as if it were using high-precision rendering software.

*Eh, hold on?*

"If that's the case, I recall a magic that can print out the image in your brain onto paper."

That's right, there was magic like that. There was a spell book in the library called "Mischief Magic Illustrated," a rather silly name.

<<Report. Search complete---it is illusion magic 'Sketch Thought.'>>

*That's it!*

I didn't remember proper spells, but for some reason, I could memorize this type of spell instantly. A slime's cells are very great, and its memory is a lot better. It's almost the same as when I was human.

"Can anyone use 'Illusion Magic'?"

"A-although I'm still an apprentice, I *am* a sorcerer!"

"Then can you try to learn this spell, also---"

Regarding the means of sharing information, making use of 'Telepathy Net' made things a lot easier. But for something that any average human could use, perhaps a spell would be more convenient. And it was then that---

<<Proposal. The most suitable alternative would be illusion magic 'Share Thought.'>>

*Oh oh, so you can do that.*

I taught 'Sketch Thought' and 'Share Thought' to the young man who claimed himself to be a sorcerer. He put them to work and found that map making became incredibly simple.

"Woah, now we won't get lost!"

"Perhaps we can even easily sketch the structure of the ruins using this magic!"

"Investigations from now on will be so much easier!"

Well, it's great that my proposals were appreciated so much.

"We still won't be able to detect traps or magic mechanisms with the map! So don't get careless!"

While the teammates were cheering, Kagali-san scolded them and quieted them down.

*She sure is something else.*

Without the need of my reminder, she didn't overlook the remaining risk.

We headed down for the gate leading to the lowest level that day.

And we reached our destination before dark.

![soft scene break]

Day three.

Today we started from the gate leading to the bottom floor.

We split up, with one group of people trying to decode the magic cast on the gate, and another group exploring the middle floor. I demonstrated how to do it yesterday, and today I would only be observing. Milim, Gobta and Ranga would join the exploration team.

"There's nothing to do, Rimuru-sama."

"How about making some tea for the people working."

"Understood!"

Just as Shion said, there really was nothing to do. However, I sometimes got questions from the team, so I felt satisfied in a way.

Shion excitedly prepared the table and put down all the cups before pouring coffee into them from a magic flask.

I had many feelings witnessing this scene.

Not too long ago, I wouldn't permit Shion to prepare any food.

"Here it is! Does anyone want to have a drink?"

Shion's words set us into a short break.

Hot coffee was quite popular, we spent a short and peaceful time together. Despite how casual I looked, I was still on guard against any ambushes. Although there wasn't any sign of that just yet.

I hope this is just me overthinking things.

However, now that I was no longer with Veldora, this would be the perfect opportunity for Mariabell and her conspirators to strike. I should remain vigilant and observe quietly.

I didn't forget to keep an extra eye on Kagali-san and her team. I checked with my 'Analyze and Assess' and didn't detect any suspicious individuals. Their abilities were just as they were told, they weren't corrupted by 'Desire' either, therefore there was no sign of them being manipulated.

If one of these people were indeed brainwashed, then my eyes---or rather, the eyes of Wisdom King Raphael---must have been deceived.

But that's highly unlikely to have happened.

However, it would be different if they were obeying willingly rather than having been brainwashed. There was that possibility as well, so I couldn't be careless. Although I didn't think they would pose much threat with their abilities.

Based on these considerations, I sipped on my coffee nonchalantly.

After some time, Milim came back with a bunch of stuff in hand.

"Rimuru, check this out! I've got so many trophies!"

To be more accurate, her hands were empty as she sat on Ranga. A couple members of the team as well as Gobta were forced to hold onto all sorts of items.

"See, all of these have a bunch of magicule. These alone should make us bank, right?"

Milim was right, most of her trophies were gear. This was already elite gear crafted by master smiths when they were first made. With the times they have endured, their magisteel has completely matured, making their quality skyrocket.

"Oh oh, it's true. Even though they won't be worth much as artwork, there are still many impressive weapons here."

"Right? Check this out, this one is unique-grade!"

This stuff was for real. We couldn't just leave them lying around, these were highly valuable.

"Where did you find all these?" I asked Milim, as I was a bit confused. "There's no way Clayman would just leave this stuff laying around..."

"Actually, I accidentally triggered some traps and a bunch of golems came out. These guys had this gear on 'em."

*Hold up, now I can't just ignore what she said.*

"You triggered a trap?"

"UH! N-not like that! It was triggered as soon as I entered the hallway, even you wouldn't be able to evade that!"

"Right! We were using magic to investigate every hallway for traps. We definitely weren't being careless!"

According to Milim and Gobta's accounts, they did not slip up. The other teammates testified for them as well, so it was the truth. It looked like the location had stored some sort of response patterns of specific types of creatures. The trap would be triggered when anyone outside of the registered patterns entered. In that way, unless the visitors knew the wavelengths needed to pass beforehand, there was no way anyone could have decoded that. You could only fight your way through.

"Then that can't be helped. By the way, I didn't know there were such complex traps."

"Umm, that taught us a great lesson. We should set traps like these in our labyrinth as well."

So only the registered individuals could pass through the hallway.

Perhaps this entire floor was used to battle against invaders of the tomb.

"In other words, it is reasonable to deduce that there are many other golems wearing unique-grade gear. I never expected that when left alone for so long, the weapons would be able to evolve, how surprising..."

Kagali-san was right.

Luckily, Milim and Gobta followed them, or the teammates might have been killed by the golems.

"Nothing happened yesterday, so I was rather reassured. But there may be other traps on this floor. However, don't panic just yet, from tomorrow onward, we need to be much more cautious in doing our work."

"You have a point. Analyzing this door seems to need more time, tomorrow---" Kagali-san was abruptly cut off as the earth suddenly began to shake. Including the ruins, the area suddenly experienced a huge energy reaction. Bits of stone were falling from the ceiling, which only added to the feeling of oppression and fear.

"What is happening---?!"

"Let's get out now, this place is gonna collapse!"

The teammates began to panic before Kagali-san scolded them loudly and told them to calm down.

"Quiet! The duration of the vibration was short, it was not an earthquake. A solid structure like this wouldn't collapse so easily. Let's all stay calm and find a place for shelter."

Her shout calmed them down. These teammates were pretty mature.

"What was that just now?" Gobta asked me in a calm voice.

"Uh---the shock wave seemed to come from the surface, and it was quite strong. The castle may have been affected as well..."

If anything were to happen, we still have 'Portals' to help us, so there's no need to panic. Upon thinking so, I gave my answer to Gobta.

But, with that being said...

Kagali-san hit the nail on the head, it was not an earthquake. It was a local energy reaction, it must've been man-made. I was also concerned about the situation on the surface, to the point that I was considering whether I should take a look outside.

It was then that I had a certain intuition.

<<Report. Hostile intent detected. The defense mechanisms within the ruins seemed to have been activated. It has been confirmed that multiple golems were on the move. In addition, someone was invading the ruins.>>

The alarm bells were set off.

Some sort of mechanical voice suddenly began to blare.

"AMALITA HAS BEEN INFILTRATED. EXTERMINATE INVADERS! AMALITA HAS BEEN INFILTRATED, EXTERMINATE INVADERS!"

The repetition of the voice gave me nothing but a premonition of danger. The situation just went downhill real fast.

The surface also wouldn't be safe, and the insides of the ruins were also in a state of emergency.

"How can this be! The entire ruins---all of Amalita's defense mechanisms have been activated on their own?"

Now even Kagali-san was panicking, her calm demeanor just now disappeared.

"There seemed to be invaders. They must have triggered the traps. But, even if we stress that we weren't the ones who triggered them, the golems won't understand."

I answered this way, yet I was starting to suspect Kagali-san. She was standing close to the door, could she have triggered the defensive mechanisms without my seeing?

Moreover, the timing seemed too good to be true. As soon as the invaders came, the alarm went off. This seemed calculated no matter how you see it.

"Milim, is there a problem?"

"No, I haven't picked up anything yet."

Secret conversations using 'Telepathy Net' or 'Magic Communication' would be picked up by Milim. So there was no use hiding it, yet there didn't seem to be any reaction this time.

I was suspecting that Kagali-san was working with the invaders, looked like I was overthinking things.

*Then, is Kagali-san innocent?*

<<Answer. Cannot be determined. If 'Soul Corridor' is connected, they can utilize secret channels of 'Telepathy Net.'>>

*I see, so I still can't put my guard down.*

I didn't want to start fighting my enemies while in the company of a suspected spy... It'd be pretty convenient if they would abandon and leave us alone, but that wouldn't be right.

"This is not looking good. The invaders were probably the same organization that got their eyes on us."

"Ah ah, can't believe they are real..."

"That earthquake must have been them---!"

"But they decided to target a demon lord, just how stupid can they be?"

Their reactions seemed genuine. There weren't any suspicious teammates. *If that's the case, I think I kinda get the picture now. Let's protect everyone here and defeat the enemies.*

"Rest assured, I promise that I will protect every one of you guys."

This surprised a couple of teammates. They probably thought that I would leave them to their death. I'd be hurt that way. We only just managed to become close, I hoped they would put more trust in me.

"Rimuru, is it just like what you expected?"

"Yes. Whether it is them taking the bait, or me, let's find out."

Just as Raphael-san had predicted, the enemies had been lured out by us. But how did they manage to get in---*I guess I'm not gonna ask about that.*

If they were hand-picked elites, it was probably a piece of cake sneaking past the dark elves on the surface and inside the castle and then getting into the ruins.

This time, let's decide who's the victor here.

I expected this to happen a long time ago. I had planned out the strategies in response, so there was no need to panic. We would be facing our enemies as planned.

![soft scene break]

The second shockwave hit.

"What is going on? I have a bad feeling about this."

It seemed that even Gobta was mindful of what was going on outside as he raised his doubts.

But, right now, I didn't have time to answer that. Because I saw it. A vicious dragon was closing in from the sky afar.

"Shit, that thing looks strong..."

It was difficult doing this from inside the ruins, but I managed to use my magicule to have 'Magic Perception' expand to the outer region. It was then that I saw this vicious dragon.

It looked a lot like Veldora, but its size was a lot bigger. Its skin had rotted and its enormous youki was leaking out.

It looked like it possessed a great amount of magicule. It may even far exceed that of an awakened demon lord, its danger level must have reached Catastrophe class.

"I-is that bad?"

"Yes, looks like it's a dragon. But not just any greater dragon---it's probably stronger than a dragon lord. Could that be Veldora's brother...?"

"Y-you mean, Veldora-sama?"

It has already exceeded the size of a regular wyvern and could only be explained to be a True Dragon. However, it didn't look like Veldora either. It had no sense of majesty or grace...

Actually, that idiot dragon had no grace or majesty, either. That's not the point. I suppose the right thing to say is that they seemed different. They were similar but different at the same time.

"That's---!" Milim suddenly went wide eyed.

"Rimuru, I've got something urgent to do. Th-that dragon is---"

As she finished, Milim stared at the sky and left with 'Spatial Movement.'

Seeing how panicked she looked, I could sort of guess what had happened. The fact that she panicked meant things were dire. In other words, our enemy had brought out something incredible.

"Unbelievable, that seemed to be Milim's friend, the dragon she sealed in the past. It wasn't revived, but it seemed like someone had broken the seal and attempted to control it."

"What! Is this true, Rimuru-sama?"

"Umm. I felt an incredibly strong shockwave. I don't think even I have a chance of winning this."

This was a fact. Not even Charybdis, who was born from the dregs of Veldora's power, could compare to this. I was sensing a fearsome aura of hatred and spite. It probably wouldn't stop until it destroyed the whole world.

Moreover, this emotion was under someone else's control. In other words, this dragon's emotion was being manipulated by Mariabell and it was her puppet.

"---Chaos Dragon, I never expected to see this tyrant in this day and age..."

Hearing Kagali-san's mutter, I felt the same.

Thankfully, Milim was here. She should be able to defeat it and put the Chaos Dragon back to sleep. There was no need for me to worry here. I needed to handle what's coming for me instead.

"Gobta, Shion, we've got company."

"Understood!"

"Just leave it to me, these third-rate golems won't stand a chance against me!"

I was planning to use a 'Portal' to let the teammates flee to the outside, but it looked like I wouldn't have the time. We were huddled near the gate, and platoons of golems were marching towards us.

Shion lunged forward and swung her odachi.

The sad thing was, the ceiling was too low, and it got stuck.

"Idiot! You gotta check your surroundings carefully before engaging!"

"S-sorry! That was a slight miscalculation."

This slight miscalculation could have cost someone's life.

Shion was pierced by the lance of the golems, but she didn't seem to have died from that. She must have slipped up because of her recklessness, hopefully she would be more careful next time.

"It's gonna be difficult to fight in tight spaces like this. But we don't know what's ahead of us, perhaps the bottom floor will be quite spacious."

"Then I'll have someone undo the seal fast---"

"No, at this point, let me handle it."

*Sorry, I've got no time for this.*

"Ranga, go and help those two."

Gobta, Shion and Ranga---those three would buy some time while I tried to finish the work at hand.

The alarm was raised, and the traps were activated. Based on the hope of preserving the ruins, I didn't want to be reckless. Yet in the end, I didn't have to worry too much about the door as it opened up almost instantly.

"Come on, let's get inside!"

The teammates followed my lead and quickly ran down the stairs. No one was in a panic and their evacuation was smooth. Kagali-san was the last in line. I protected her from the back and went down the stairs as well.

And so, everyone made it to the bottom floor.

The floor where the dead slumbered.

It did not quite look like a tomb, as a bright light filled the place. It was a large and spacious meadow. This serene scenery almost made me forget about our situation upon reaching it. I couldn't help but be mesmerized.

But this was not the time to be amazed.

The next second, Gobta fell down the stairs. We began to battle against the golems that were coming after him.

However, the tables turned quickly. Now that Shion could move freely, she began to smash all the golems into pieces.

![break]

At this point, there wasn't gonna be any mercy for anyone. If the opportunity presents itself, then we must crush our enemies. Surely, our opponents shared the same sentiment.

Provoking Milim---they were willing to take on such a risk in order to isolate me. I didn't expect them to go to this length. Honestly, I might have underestimated Mariabell.

*However, it's not gonna happen again from now on.*

<<---Roger that. Converting to full battle mode.>>

I calmly prepared myself. Removing all limits that I had layered onto myself, I prepared for the enemies coming our way.

Now we just had to wait for the mastermind to arrive.

![soft scene break]

There were hordes of golems, but the situation was looking good for us.

Shion had completely gone wild while Ranga provided support and disruptions. Gobta took the chance to use his gun to destroy the golems and even had plenty of time to reload.

It looked like they were all handling the fights quite well. The other teammates were relieved as well.

"About that, I'm really surprised that someone actually attacked. Who would be so daring as to launch an attack on the demon lord? And they even awakened that Chaos Dragon---" Kagali-san asked me out of curiosity.

She seemed rather panicked and sounded quite worried. It'd be impressive if all of this were just an act, but I honestly had no idea about what was going on in her heart.

"Sorry to have dragged you guys into this matter."

"There's no such thing! Now that the Chaos Dragon has been revived, it is rather reassuring to have Rimuru-sama at our aid."

"That's right! We need to report this back to HQ as soon as possible so that they can figure out a solution."

"But, if Demon Lord Milim were to be defeated, wouldn't that leave us with no solution at all..."

"Rather than thinking about that, it's more important to overcome the trouble brewing right before us! We have no idea who did this, but intentionally triggering the traps is terribly wicked."

Some people brought up optimistic views, it seemed that they had adjusted their mood quite fast.

"Didn't I just say that I'll protect you all? That being said, I have to win first."

To reassure the teammates, I intentionally joked about the situation.

We had Gobta, Ranga and Shion here. The strongest among the demon lords, Milim, also wouldn't lose to the Chaos Dragon.

Our situation may not exactly look bright, but it was definitely not the worst. We were gonna defeat all of our enemies and clear the burdens at hand. Then we would have to worry about what came next. It was fairly simple.

Kagali-san probably was reassured as well after hearing my words, she hadn't spoken much since.

I turned to Gobta and the others who were fighting while waiting for the people that were to arrive.

"---Rimuru-sama sure has a lot of enemies. Is it because you became a demon lord?" Kagali-san suddenly said lightly.

I happened to be available while waiting for my enemies, so I answered casually, "I suppose so, not that I wanted any of them."

"Why?"

"The Kingdom of Farmus pissed me off. Demon Lord Clayman played dirty and forced me to defend myself. Hinata the Saint had problems with me because of a misunderstanding. It's always been someone else trying to pick a fight with me, that's why I was willing to confront them. In a sense, they were justified self-defense."

"I see. Then, has Rimuru-sama never actively set up a scheme?"

"Not exactly true. There was a conflict of interest between my opponents and me this time, after all. Our beliefs clashed, and it became a competition of who would strike first. That's how things have developed to this point."

"Can you resolve the conflict without violence---?"

"Perhaps. But, if the only way to win in this fight is to absorb your opponent, under the circumstances that my opponent doesn't exactly want to be absorbed by me, I suppose this is the right call."

Dwargon and Sarion---Tempest had forged an alliance with these two megastates, there was no reason why we would lose in an economic battle with the Western Nations.

If our enemies were to not do anything, I would surely expand my influence fully in terms of economy all over the Western Nations. Do not underestimate Wisdom King Raphael-san that trumps a quantum computer.

"---Eh? In other words, you thought that what your enemies were doing was the correct thing?"

*Hmmm, I'm not so sure about that.*

If we were to recognize the difference in our ideology and both take a step back, things may have worked if the both of us steered clear from each other's business.

Our enemy had justifications, but so did I. I wanted to have control over my opponent, yet they did not wish to be controlled, so confrontation was the only solution. In some sense, economic warfare was far more horrifying than war fought with men. There was no concept of surrender. It wouldn't stop until one of the players was absorbed.

That's why I was lucky that they decided to use violence to confront me. In this way, they would admit defeat once they realized they had no chance of winning. Even though that was the only method left for our opponents, whether they were justified in doing so was another issue entirely.

"We have different stances, and so-called justice also has infinite forms. I can't say that I am definitely the one in the right, but to quit here means that we will be at a disadvantage. That's why all we can do is to fight our enemies with everything we have..."

Of course, we could also yield and beg for mercy.

Though, if I admitted defeat, all my companions would suffer.

"But you can still respect their perspective, exchange opinions and try to establish good relationships. Wouldn't there be no need to be hostile against each other then?"

That was a difficult question to answer.

How should I put it---but before I could concern myself with the question, a young girl spoke up and answered it for me.

"No way, that wouldn't work. Man's desire is limitless and will not simply endure. Once your opponent decides to step back, you would obviously make more demands. That's simply human nature."

Yes. If we were to take a step back, our opponent would be understanding as well---I wish that were true, but that wasn't realistic in the slightest. If I were just a mere citizen of the world, perhaps I could look forward to a dream like that, perhaps I could've praised such idealism.

But---as the ruler, there was no way I could believe such a fairy tale.

It seemed that the head of our enemies thought the same as me.

"We seem to understand each other. I thought so too. I am Demon Lord Rimuru, and you are?"

"Nice to meet you. I am Mariabell, your enemy."

![break]

Almost in an instant, all of the golems were destroyed.

In front of me was the young girl that I had seen before during the nation founding festival. As I suspected, she was the enemy. And she was a lot bolder than I expected. I thought she would be more cunning and would stay off the frontline. It was rather amazing to see her leading the charge at the scene.

She wasn't alone, however. There were three more people around her.

Gai, with wounds all over his body, and another man in a knight uniform.

In addition, Yuuki Kagurazaka was by her side as well.

Kagali-san and her teammates were all shocked by his presence.

"P-President! What are you doing here?"

"Could...you be the one that's been trying to kill the demon lord?"

"This has gotta be a lie? If that's the case, why would he order us to investigate the ruins?"

They started chattering, yet Yuuki had no reaction. It was probably just like what Glenda said, he had been completely dominated.

"Yuuki-sama, what is going on? Are you betraying us?" Kagali-san's voice was filled with anger.

I thought that might have been genuine, but it didn't matter at this point. I just wanted to end this whole charade and go to support Milim. But we would have things to deal with before that.

"I thought so too. You are indeed my enemy. But, before we fight, is it okay for me to confirm something with you?" I looked at the blonde, young girl and asked.

The teammates were rather confused about my attitude, but none of them said a thing. At this point, they had all probably put their trust in me.

No, perhaps it was something else. Perhaps they were consumed by the eerie aura from the young girl. She has soft blonde hair and pink lips. Her cheeks were smooth and energized, as cute as a doll. The young girl called Mariabell looks to be around ten years old. Yet her cruel personality truly contrasted her appearance.

"What do you wish to confirm?"

"Become my subject. Then we can avoid unnecessary conflicts."

"Laughable, how laughable. That's supposed to be my line. Demon Lord Rimuru, you will be defeated here. If you wish to avoid that fate, then let me dominate you."

"Your policy is in direct contrast with mine and will result in unnecessary conflicts. Wouldn't it lead to the suffering of many innocent people just so that a minority of people would keep their wealth?"

"Yes, I admit it. But then, so what? The weak deserves to be drained, that is only natural. Doesn't might make right in the monster world?"

"I suppose, but I dislike that."

"Foolish, how foolish. Do you believe in the idealistic view that all men are equal as well?"

"No, I'm not that foolish. But everyone deserves a chance. Some people may never excel in a certain craft, but that shouldn't be the determination of one's value."

Some people would come to master things late, some possess talents that no one knows. Some people may hate work, but still display artistic talents. But with Mariabell's logic, you would never have a chance to turn the table just because of your wealth. That I could not accept.

People are not born equal. That is only natural, perhaps even inheriting wealth from your parents can be considered as a talent. But you can't therefore deny a whole population for that reason. If they are denied their chances to receive education, they would only be left to be exploited by other people. This would be the outcome of neglecting human possibilities.

To put it shortly, I found that to be regretful.

Human talents are capable of infinite possibilities. How could you give up on them like that.

However---

"Boring, how boring. I can't believe a demon lord would be such a naive idealist, you are so incredibly foolish."

My thoughts couldn't reach Mariabell.

"Is that so? It can't be helped. Then we should settle who's right with simpler means."

"My thoughts exactly. I'll give you a reality check."

Our discussion would never lead to a conclusion. From the very start, we could only reach a result with combat. On one hand, I felt the situation to be rather sad, but on the other hand, I approved of it.

Perhaps the day that all humans could understand each other would never come, but that does prove the diversity of humanity.

It's the unavoidable conflict in evolution.

Only the winner's claim is correct.

Mariabell and I, two opposing forms of justice, at that moment, went toe to toe.

![soft scene break]

"Go get him!"

On Mariabell's order, Gai struck first. He charged ahead with a deranged look in his eyes. He probably hated me a lot. Could it be that he escaped after being taken away by the magical inquisitors?

"Hmph! Someone like you dare to challenge Rimuru-sama---" Shion growled as she planned to disrupt Gai, but was blocked by Yuuki.

"Your opponent is me."

"Oh, interesting, a weakling that is being controlled by that woman, you are not worthy of my time!" Shion shouted, her eyes reddened.

That meant she was getting serious. A strong aura of youki burst out of her as she raised her odachi. Then she began to combat Yuuki.

She would handle that for now, the problem was the other man. In my opinion, he was stronger than a Holy Knight. Gobta would handle him. Even though Ranga was still around, I still felt a bit uneasy.

"Gobta, it's time to show them the prowess of the Four Heavenly Kings!" Shion exclaimed. I almost forgot that that character setting was a thing.

"Right!" Gobta replied. "Then I'm gonna use my hidden trump card!"

The next second, Gobta shouted "Transformation!"

Transformation---aka 'Magic Wolf Transformation.' Gobta and Ranga merged together, forming the handsome werewolf that had no element of Gobta left.

This should do it.

Unlike one month ago, Gobta seemed to have learned how to control his power. He was not being led by Ranga this time and was doing fine.

My guess was that their opponent was some tough enemy stronger than the 'Ten Great Saints.' But Gobta right now should be able to handle it. I was confident he would, and decided to focus on my enemy at hand.

Oh yeah, before that---

I concentrated my youki in my left hand and threw it at Gai. That hit alone obliterated Gai from this world.

Having been corrupted by Mariabell's 'Greed,' his power seemed to have exceeded his actual ability. But to me, he was just some random guy in my way.

"You want to fight me? Fine, then I'll give you what you want before you die."

It was pretty cruel to say this to someone who was about to die. However, he needed to learn a lesson.

"Liar! What is this, what is this, how can there be power like this---!"

"What is what? This is who I am when I'm serious. You'll be next. You should know what type of enemy you are fucking. I'm gonna devour you whole until you won't be able to reincarnate. Just sit tight and be my food."

This is what I called pre-battle etiquette.

I was already getting serious, so don't expect me to show any mercy.

I had recognized Mariabell as my enemy.

And an enemy had to be eliminated. This was only natural.

I needed to take care of her fast and go reinforce Milim. That's what I told myself as I took a step towards Mariabell.

![hard scene break]
Mariabell suddenly realized she was confronting one of the strongest people in this world, the Octagram.

"I get the feeling that Rimuru-sama is now quite terrifying."

"Idiot, why are you so useless after becoming a Heavenly King. Listen now, Gobta. This is the true form of Demon Lord Rimuru-sama. Ah ah, to be able to witness such a handsome display, I am truly lucky!"

"I-is that so? I feel like the Rimuru-sama we see every day is the true him..."

"I'll admit that Rimuru-sama is very beautiful in daily life. Hehe, speaking of which, even secretary number two, Diablo, is not fortunate enough to see Rimuru-sama now. He will probably feel very regretful. Hehehe, I can brag about this in front of him."

Hearing this type of conversation, Mariabell only thought they sounded idiotic. But she didn't have time for that. She had to focus on dealing with Rimuru in front of her.

*This has gotta be a joke, this has to be. What happened during the council meeting should have been perceived as extremely rude to Demon Lord Rimuru. Yet somehow, he wasn't that pissed off, and that's why he was called 'Mild.' But that is woefully far from the truth.*

Indeed, when a demon lord became serious, it was an opponent that even Mariabell couldn't underestimate.

Mariabell had strengthened Gai to her fullest capabilities. He was stronger than third-rate majin. His abilities were already beyond that of humans. In fact, even demon lords such as Frey or Karion would fall into a hard battle against Gai. After all, Mariabell had burnt all of Gai's remaining life force and soul to allow him to wield such incredible strength.

But alas---Demon Lord Rimuru sent Gai to hell with a flick of his hand, as if he were casually burning trash. That's how unfathomably large the chasm in between their power levels was. This wasn't an adult versus a child, their difference was like an elephant to an ant.

Mariabell's soul possessed power greater than Gai's. Having survived the reincarnation across worlds, she had reached an abnormal state of being. Even so, Mariabell still thought the demon lord posed a significant threat.

That's why she had laid down her trump card long ago.

'Holy Purification Barrier'---the ultimate skill against monsters, the strongest 'Killing Barrier.' Mariabell had prepared meticulously and arranged 'Blood Shadows' hiding on the outskirts of the castle.

"Before you start bragging, you better know your weight. Know the difference between the intellect of a monster and a human!" She shouted at Rimuru.

At the same time, she gave the order through 'Magic Communication.'

"Eh! My body feels so heavy---"

"I remember this feeling. It's even stronger than back then, is this the true power of the barrier?"

The werewolf looked confused, while the oni laughed and commented arrogantly.

*This just pisses me off*---Mariabell gritted her teeth.

They were both worthy of the title "Heavenly King." These two were extremely powerful. The werewolf there---Gobta---seemed to be the one who almost attained championship during the tournament. Surely, the oni who had the same rank as him was also a majin that could not be underestimated.

There were also the majins that accompanied Demon Lord Rimuru during the council meeting.

*This force is simply insane. If we were to confront all of them, we wouldn't stand a chance, even without Veldora's presence. But---*

But now, things were different.

The demon lord was way too confident in his abilities. Under these circumstances, he had his guard down completely. *This will cost him his life.* Mariabell gave a light, smug smile.

Yet her thoughts were too naive.

"As suspected, I knew you would use this. That's why I've already made plans for that."

Demon Lord Rimuru smiled fearlessly.

A moment later, the 'Holy Purification Barrier' that was just activated, was gone.

"What! What did you do?"

"Seriously, do you imagine that I would just stroll around in the open like this with the note 'Come and attack me' stuck on my back? Of course I would have guards securing the surroundings of the castle. You were probably thinking about setting me up, just as we did. That's why I was the bait to lure you out. In order to control me, the user of 'Greed' herself must step out of the shadows," came the answer Rimuru gave to Mariabell.

It was at that point, Mariabell understood everything. She realized that the missing Glenda was not eliminated, but that she had betrayed her.

*Yes, he is correct. It wasn't the demon lord who's overconfident, it was me...*

Now that her trump card had been destroyed, the situation was dire.

Gai was dead.

Yuuki seemed to have the upper hand but could not take down the oni.

There was someone else, ex-'Martial Sage' Lamar just wanted to avenge Glenda, and he had fallen into a tough fight against werewolf Gobta.

Both were fortified by Mariabell's 'Greed,' but they were unable to win. This revealed a great deal about the abilities of their enemies. Given the circumstances, Mariabell was the only one who could change the situation. This young girl---almost as delicate as a doll---was about to show her true colors...

![break]

Mariabell was burning her 'soul' to push her abilities past their limits.

All for victory.

She couldn't change the fact that they had been set up, but this was still a favorable situation in her eyes. She wouldn't get a second chance like this. She was well aware of that, that's why Mariabell had no regrets.

"Then I shall show my true abilities. I'll gamble all I have and kill you!"

"Fine, I shall go all out as well."

As she finished, Mariabell charged ahead.

She stomped the ground and threw a mean kick at Rimuru. That kind of physical prowess wasn't that of a little girl. It was more ferocious than a cannonball, its power was enough to break a steel rod in two.

But it was nothing to Rimuru. He easily blocked the kick and sent his opponent flying away.

Mariabell supported herself on the ground and used the recoil to dodge instantly. She avoided Rimuru's next strike and returned the jab with her 'Greed.'

"Die! ---'Death Wish'!---"

A wave of darkness rippled over Rimuru.

The desire to survive is every creature's instinct---reversing that instinct became Mariabell's ultimate technique. She has pushed her Unique Skill to the extreme with her own will.

That was Mariabell Rosso.

Her Unique skill was one of the Deadly Sin Skills that originated from humans' fundamental emotions. No one could resist this strengthened desire, Mariabell had every reason to win.

*Indeed, the situation has forced me to do this. I didn't want to kill him, but this is not such a bad choice. It's more stupid to do nothing against a threat like this---*

Mariabell wanted to dominate Rimuru, but an opponent of that caliber couldn't be conquered so simply with a naive thought like that. What Mariabell had decided to do, was to ensure her victory.

Demon Lord Rimuru was surrounded by the wave of darkness. He wasn't resisting, simply not moving while standing there.

"How disappointing. No matter how strong you are, you ultimately cannot throw away your desire to live. Then I am truly invincible."

In fact, Mariabell could indeed be called one of the strongest. She could probably even win against an awakened Clayman, Frey or Karion. Even Hinata the Saint could only yield before Mariabell's Skill.

That was how strong Mariabell was.

All with her Unique Skill 'Greed.' With that being said---

"Sorry to disappoint you, the analysis has been complete. Your power won't be able to harm me."

Rimuru had long awoken his Ultimate Skill.

From that point onward, Mariabell had no chance of winning.

---Because even Mariabell's strongest Skill was but at the level of Unique---

![hard scene break]
Just as Raphael-san predicted, Mariabell had prepared a 'Holy Purification Barrier.' Granbell used to be the head of the Western Holy Church, we expected that she would inherit his technique. And it went as we predicted.

Even though it was almost scarily strong, it was right down my alley.

Because of it, Gabil, Hakurou, and Souka, who had been preparing for days, finally had a chance to act. They didn't have anything to do lately and it was difficult trying to comfort them.

What an occasion worthy of celebration---I felt very reassured upon thinking so.

By the way, this girl called Mariabell, she was strong, truly strong.

After exchanging blows with her, I experienced her strength firsthand. And when I was surrounded by that wave of darkness, I felt a shiver go down my spine. Even though I was not afraid of dying, the thought of any of my subordinates being hit by the same Skill did terrify me.

Anyone other than me would have died.

My guess was that Diablo probably would've been able to take it, actually, Shion may as well. But for people like Benimaru, they would, surely, have died. The best solution was probably to have them train their mental states---their 'souls.' I couldn't help but think so.

Following the proposal of Raphael-san, I conducted 'Analyze and Assess' and gave the ultimatum to Mariabell.

"Sorry to disappoint you, the analysis has been completed. Your power won't be able to harm me."

Even though she could control other people, I could leave her alive if she no longer troubled other people. I said that with these thoughts in mind.

This was definitely a notion that even I felt was naive, but this was a ten-year-old girl we are talking about here. Killing her would sow tremendous guilt in my heart. If she is willing to surrender, I would be very happy to oblige.

With that being said, I was straying further away from humanity more and more. So perhaps I could be a bit cold-blooded.

"---Quit joking around. This is not enough, not enough. Even if this were to cost everything I have, I am going to win here!"

Unfortunately, Mariabell did not want to listen to my words.

Our ideologies fundamentally opposed each other. I had seen this coming from the start, yet with how things had developed, I kind of felt sad.

Mariabell launched a series of attacks like a maniac.

But the sad thing was, she no longer posed any threat to me.

Since we couldn't understand each other, there was no other way.

"I'll send you on your way with no pain. Reflect a bit inside my body---"

As I said to Mariabell, I decided to activate 'Soul Devouring' of 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth.'

Yet at that instant---

"Clang!" I heard a loud noise just as I saw Shion being flung away. I turned to where the incident occurred subconsciously and realized it was Yuuki who sent Shion flying with a kick. Normally, Shion should have 'Ultraspeed Regeneration,' yet she was injured and was unable to get up.

*There's something wrong.*

"Shion---!"

" "AHAHAA-HAHAHAA!" "

My shout was overshadowed by a wave of mad laughter. It was Mariabell---and Yuuki. The two started laughing almost simultaneously.

"Impressive, how impressive, Demon Lord Rimuru. I underestimated you, I saw you as so much less. I never expected you to be a monster like that..."

"Indeed. I didn't expect you would have won against Mariabell. But don't forget about me."

Yuuki stood before me after defeating Shion.

Mariabell unleashed her dark wave onto Yuuki, his power seemed to have increased.

<<Answer. Strength of Individual 'Yuuki Kagurazaka' has increased. Suspect individual 'Mariabell Rosso' has transferred her power through Unique Skill 'Greed.'>>

*Just how many more trump cards does she have?*

It was Yuuki this time.

*He's only under the control of 'Greed,' hopefully I can suppress him as opposed to killing him.*

"Tsk, don't blame me if you die."

"That should be my line!"

After that quick exchange, both Yuuki and I struck. Our legs crossed in the process, both of us were sent flying away. It seemed to have happened before, both this time both of us were serious.

Yuuki was surprisingly strong. In terms of his physique, he may even be stronger than Mariabell. Shion was neutralized even before she could pull any of her techniques off, Yuuki must be on a completely different level.

I wasn't planning to give him a pass, but right now, even a speedy victory may be problematic.

As I thought so, I began to confront Yuuki.

Interestingly enough---during the time we fought, Mariabell had some secret plan brewing.

Not good, this is not good. But I was too distracted fighting Yuuki now. Mariabell turned her back to us and began to run for the center of the tomb. I wanted to pursue her but was blocked by Yuuki.

Never mind.

Mariabell wouldn't be able to escape anyway. Now that I had full control over the wavelength of her soul, no matter where she ran to, I could find her.

As opposed to Mariabell, I was more concerned about dealing with Yuuki right now. After settling down with the idea, I turned my eyes back onto him.

![soft scene break]

In the corner of my eyes, Kagali-san and the other teammates were taking care of Shion. She was still conscious, but didn't seem able to stand up. She didn't look defeated, but could do nothing about the situation. To have forced Shion to such a state, Yuuki must've been strong. But I wasn't worried at all.

Just as Raphael-san had said, Unique Skills can't best Ultimate Skills. It's a matter of the strength of your 'soul.' In order to awaken strength greater than a Unique Skill, you seem to need the mental strength that corresponds to it. Against such a strong mental state, a Unique Skill appeared powerless.

That's why, in order to beat someone who had awakened their Ultimate Skill, you also required an Ultimate Skill. In other words, even if Mariabell transferred her strength to Yuuki, he wouldn't have been able to defeat me. Meaning, this is my win---but my confidence was quickly shattered in the next instant.

"Then I'm gonna show you my true strength."

After saying so, Yuuki unleashed a right spin kick. It was no different from the strike just now, so I calmly blocked it with my left arm.

The next second, everything below my left elbow was blown to pieces.

"---HUH?"

While feeling shocked, I backed off to make more distance. I looked at my hand in disbelief.

<<Unexpected. 'Universal Barrier' of 'Covenant King Uriel' was destroyed. Deduce individual 'Yuuki Kagurazaka' has unusual attribute--- 'Anti-Skill.'>>

*Eh, hold on?*

*Does that mean that my 'Absolute Defense' won't work on Yuuki.*

*No, more importantly, does that mean most of my attacks would be rendered ineffective?*

<<Correct. 'Anti-Skill' is a spiritual attribute and can shut down magic and Skills. Only techniques such as saint sword techniques may be effective.>>

*In other words, melt slash may work?*

This was not some joke, my Ultimate Skill seemed to have been cracked. I probably wouldn't have understood even if it were explained to me in detail. But I still knew that this was a difficult attribute to deal with.

"Didn't you say that you don't have any Unique Skill or special abilities?"

"I was honest. But didn't I also tell you that my physical abilities are unusually advanced?"

I wanted to complain to him "What kind of joke was that." He wasn't lying, and it wouldn't matter complaining to someone who had been controlled.

*But then, what should I do now?*

Yuuki's attack worked on me, but my attack wouldn't work on him. This was only going to waste more time, and with how things had turned out, I may not be able to keep him alive anymore.

But if possible, for the sake that we were both Japanese, I wanted to spare his life. It would be a different case if he were antagonizing us out of his own will, but it was just sad that he was being manipulated.

However---Yuuki was not an opponent that I could beat while pulling punches.

I pulled out my straight sword. I infused my youki into the dark blade.

"Oh...nice sword," Yuuki said and pulled out a dagger from his belt using his right hand as well as a rather short single-edged sword using his left hand.

He began to dual wield, lowering his body to display a unique stance. This was not any style that I'd seen before, it was his original style.

Seeing Yuuki's fighting style, I realized something. It was concerning that magic and Skills didn't work on him, but Yuuki didn't have 'Physical Attack Nullification.' Even though he had the special attribute of 'Anti Skill,' I could still harm him with the sword.

*I get it now, no wonder why part of my Skills are still functionable. When it comes to me, every strike I make is, in some capacity, affected by my Skills, that's why I couldn't harm him. Perhaps it would be more effective if I don't apply any youki?*

<<No, insufficient information in that regard, no correct answer can be deduced.>>

*Got it, then let's test it out here.*

I stamped the ground and slashed at Yuuki. He blocked my sword with his left hand. His body sure was tough, he could follow my speed with ease. But I'd had some intense sword fights with Hinata as well. That has helped me improve my technique and boost my confidence.

I didn't panic as I had long seen step two and three. Even though my Skills wouldn't work on Yuuki, my 'Future Attack Prediction' was not affected. That was because Raphael-san was the one doing the calculations to predict Yuuki's actions.

Yuuki's left hand sword was mainly for defense, while the dagger in his right hand was for attacking. Normally, it would be the other way around; I found it pretty strange how he wielded them.

Let's take a look at the weapons' quality now.

Both swords seemed to be crafted out of high density magisteel. The metal had experienced some evolution, and the status of the weapons also increased by orders of magnitude. These were rare weapons even among special-grade class. They may even be considered legendary-grade.

While dueling, I made an unexpected revelation.

<<Report. 'Anti-Skill' does not apply to weapons.>>

I didn't expect that Yuuki actually became weaker while wielding weapons. This was only known to me as well, so I supposed it was a blind spot for Yuuki.

Against his normal attacks, I had 'Absolute Defense' to protect me.

I intentionally let Yuuki hit me.

"Haha, Rimuru-san has gotten sloppy!"

I pretended that my balance was off and showed an opening. Yuuki struck at the opening. His dagger seemed special as well, it could extend or retract to disrupt my defense.

To Yuuki's eyes, that must have been a sneak attack. Nonetheless, all of this was part of my plan. His dagger was stopped midway as it was plunging at my heart.

I touched its blade to confirm that the dagger was imbued with a strong poison that could inflict great psychological damage. Had I been stabbed, even I would've been hurt.

But such an assumption was meaningless.

"This is it, what a waste! You were hurting me more fighting with your bare hand."

"What the hell, this is bullshit---!" Yuuki's eyes widened as he shouted.

I had no obligation to listen to his complaints.

I launched the technique I just developed during the festival without saying a thing. That was the Storm Breaker---a technique based on Hinata's Melt Slash that combined magic and sword technique. The magic used was 'Storm Magic' from 'Storm King Veldora.' Speaking of Veldora's magic, as opposed to its direct damage, its prolonged effect was way scarier. The injured wound would start to decay and corrode the entire body.

The same went for Storm Breaker. This deadly sword technique could corrode my opponent's life force. However, likely due to his special attribute, Yuuki's wound didn't start to decay. His chest was slashed open, leaving a large gash, but it didn't seem lethal.

"Uhh..." Yuuki moaned as he glared at me.

I wanted to see what was really going on, but the dark fog around was disrupting my senses. He had been completely corrupted by Mariabell's 'Greed.' If I could remove it, I wouldn't have to kill him.

<<Answer. Due to the disruption of 'Anti-Skill,' interference is impossible.>>

*That won't work.*

This left me with no other choice.

"I am the victor. I really want to help you get out of Mariabell's control, but it seems I won't be able to manage that. I will have to do it the hard way, don't blame me."

*I'm going to severely wound him and knock him out. When Yuuki goes unconscious, I'll take care of Mariabell. If her influence disappears as a result, everyone gets to enjoy the happy ending. But if it doesn't, we'll see about that then.*

I pointed my sword towards Yuuki. The sad thing was, I wouldn't be able to hurt him, even if I tried, using my bare hands, because it would be canceled by the power of 'Anti-Skill.'

I was calling this bullcrap internally, but that was just Yuuki's specialty.

Using strength just shy of hitting my limit, I infused it in my sword. My goal was to hit him with the blunt edge. Luckily, this sword was very tough and wouldn't break easily. If I were to use too much force, I would chop Yuuki in two. It was difficult controlling my strength.

And so, I reversed the blade, turning the sharp edge toward me, and just as I was about to swing---

"H-have mercy!" Kagali-san suddenly shouted. "Please reconsider for a second and don't kill Yuuki-sama---"

I turned to her and realized that she had, in fact, stood up and rushed to Yuuki's side.

"Oi, that's dangerous! Yuuki's being controlled by Mariabell!"

"I-it's okay! Yuuki-sama has an extremely firm will, his mental strength wouldn't be so easily defeated by that little girl!"

Ignoring my advice, Kagali-san held onto Yuuki tightly.

In addition to her, there were also the members of the investigation group following Kagali-san.

"Right, that's right! President's not that weak!"

"Indeed! He's always rebellious and would never show weakness to anyone."

"Just to act tough in front of us, he would go slay a dragon by himself!"

*Looks like Yuuki's really admired.*

With all these people protecting him, I ended up becoming the villain. No, I wanted to do the same had it been an option to resolve the ordeal without killing him. But right now, there was no time for something so naive, it was best that I'd choose the most appropriate approach under these circumstances.

*Look at me, guys, my blade is already reversed!*

I wanted to see this clearly as I glanced towards Kagali-san and the others. They ran behind Yuuki and began to talk to him. *If doing that could remove Mariabell's influence, what do you think I've been trying to do all this time?*

But to my surprise---

"I don't want to kill him either, but right now---"

I was about to say this to remind them not to get in my way.

It was then that---

"Y-you guys..."

Yuuki began to mumble and showed a pained expression.

<<Report. Individual 'Yuuki Kagurazaka' is confirmed to show signs of change. Mental influence of 'Greed' seems to have been removed--->>

*...Eh?*

*Are you serious? It just happened out of nowhere, and at such a timing, no less?*

I was not entirely convinced, though Yuuki's killing intent did seem to have disappeared. *Is this real?* Although I thought so to myself, I could only accept this result.

![soft scene break]

Since Yuuki had returned to normal, the only remaining foes were Mariabell and the Chaos Dragon.

"I seem to have been a burden, I'm so sorry. But I've been saved, Rimuru-san!"

"Uh, right. It's great that you're okay..."

*I definitely did not have the idea that you shouldn't blame me even if you had died*---that was my message to Yuuki.

"Oi, Gobta! Finish things up already!"

I channeled my anger towards Gobta and successfully changed the topic.

And so, we quickly finished the battle here.

![break]

Shion was all right. Yuuki's 'Anti-Skill' was not permanent. After some time, she was revived by her 'Ultraspeed Regeneration.'

She was still glaring at Yuuki angrily before I comforted her.

"How embarrassing, my skills were still not there yet..."

Shion was very frustrated after throwing a tantrum.

I tried to comfort her again saying "There're plenty of chances in the future."

I turned to Gobta.

"I told him that Glenda-san is still alive, but this guy just won't listen..."

He looked exhausted. Against a Gobta who had fully unleashed his potential with Ranga's strength, Lamar was no match for him. With Gobta's fighting style and Ranga's superb instincts, the two worked well to support each other. Werewolf Gobta was truly strong.

Ranga's consciousness didn't disappear either, it was focused on surveying the surroundings. Learning about their different roles in a fight, it was kind of like the relationship between me and Raphael-san.

No wonder they were so strong.

The reason why Gobta fell into a tough fight was because he discovered his opponent Lamar was committed to avenging Glenda. Gobta's kindhearted nature prevented him from killing him.

I asked Raphael-san to help shut down Lamar's mental interference. He had overused the strength of his soul, but he wasn't in any critical condition. He had come back to his senses and seemed relieved to learn Glenda was all right.

That's one less thing to deal with---unfortunately our situation was no less dire in the slightest.

![break]

Now wasn't the time to rest. The violent earthquake continued, indicating that Milim was unable to seal the Chaos Dragon. I needed to hurry and back her up.

"Rimuru-san, I want to chase after Mariabell," Yuuki announced, despite still being wounded... *Eh, hold on, when did his wounds heal?*

"Your wounds are all healed?"

"Ah, well, Kagali knows healing magic."

Eh? And he said that so casually?

"Hmm, doesn't magic not work on you..."

"Oh, it's not a problem. I can turn off that attribute with my own will."

"..."

I was pretty baffled. Yuuki even replied with a bright smile, that's just cheating.

When Hinata mentioned that she possessed a special attribute that would purify magicule, even she said she couldn't switch it off herself. And somehow the much more problematic 'Anti-Skill' could be switched on and off by his own will...

*That's some bullshit right there.*

*Never mind, it doesn't matter for now. Let's see what Yuuki has to propose.*

"Do you have the slightest winning chance?"

"I will easily win if I am careful enough. Even though she has been controlling me, my pride would not allow such a thing to happen."

"Rimuru-sama, I have a request for you as well. Mariabell is likely contemplating destroying this ruin. The ruins of 'Soma' that I investigated were suspected to have some sort of a magic engine device that powered the city. This city is very similar to the structure of that. If the device were to be overloaded, it may decimate everything in the surrounding area."

"...Are you suggesting that Mariabell knows how to overload the device?"

"You only need to inject too much mana into it, and the device would overload. Moreover, it being located within a ruin that hasn't been utilized for thousands of years, god knows what type of reaction it would provoke..."

Even though I was not sure whether such an artifact existed or not, it would be bad if her guess were right.

"Do you know about its structure?"

"I have done a thorough investigation at 'Soma.' If there really were to be an issue, I can prevent it!"

*This beauty's serious expression sure has some tenacity in it.*

I didn't agree because of her beauty, but her tenacity.

"Then I'll let you handle it. Yuuki, I'll be counting on you!"

"Very well. I shall return that dishonor several times over."

*What an attitude, Yuuki sure is confident.*

And so, the matter of chasing Mariabell was handed to Yuuki and Kagali.

![break]

"Shion, Gobta, lead the team and meet up with the dark elves. Protect them on the way!"

"Understood!"

"What about Rimuru-sama?"

"I'm going to reinforce Milim. If I'm not fast enough, we may all end up being attacked by the Chaos Dragon."

Milim was trying her best to suppress the dragon, but even a stray shot from it would be devastating. There was no time to rest, I needed to decide what to do and get to work.

"Then I'm going too!"

"No, even though your flesh wound has healed, your internal wounds have not. Don't follow me, please protect everyone else!"

"Uh, understood..."

Even though Shion was unwilling, she accepted.

Yuuki and Kagali-san departed immediately to chase after Mariabell who fled to the center of the tomb.

After entrusting the other matters to Gobta and Shion, I left to support Milim.

![hard scene break]
Mariabell was on the run. However, she had not given up on achieving victory. She would not allow her plan to fail now that she had unleashed her last trump card, 'The Sealed Chaos Dragon.' She still had one more option.

Deep inside the tomb---at the heart of the ancient elven capital---there lay the fruit of the old world's magic technology. She has heard of this and planned to overload the device in order to kill Rimuru.

*This is the way to defeat that monster. My strongest pawn Yuuki will win me some time. I will use this time to find the magic core and overload it---*

Yuuki's report included information about the ancient ruins 'Soma.' She heard that 'Amalita' was also an ancient city built by this race. If their structure was similar, even Mariabell could operate the device with ease.

By destabilizing the central control of the magic reactor core, it would cause a large-scale magic destruction. Right now, Rimuru was focused on fighting Yuuki, detonating the device would kill Rimuru. He wouldn't have a chance to resist.

*It will be a surprise attack, one that's powerful enough to take down even Demon Lord Rimuru*---Mariabell thought to herself.

![break]

She arrived at the center of the tomb. Yet there was no device mentioned in the report. Moreover, the entire place was empty. The graves were empty, and there weren't even any decorations or jewels. Actually, there was some treasure lying around, but the real valuables---the magic gear---were all missing.

"Strange, how strange. H-how is this possible---?" she couldn't help but ask.

*There's no one who can answer that*---or so she thought.

"Ahahaha! There was never such a thing as a central control of the magic engine reactor in this ruin."

"---UH!"

"By the way, neither was there anything like that in 'Soma.'"

"...Yuuki, is that you?"

"Yep, it's me," someone replied to Mariabell's call. There was no doubt about it, it was Yuuki.

He casually presented himself with Kagali by his side.

"Aren't you fighting Demon Lord Rimuru---?"

"We are done fighting. I was fighting him seriously but couldn't win. While Rimuru-san was still holding back there, I wasn't. If I had had a chance, I would have wanted to beat him there."

"I was almost sweating watching it happen. I was seriously worried that you had really betrayed us."

"Ahaha, sorry, sorry. I figured that it would be more authentic if I had tricked you as well. Although I trusted that you would have seen through my act instantly."

"I suppose, it doesn't matter now. The result was probably the most ideal. If that was Yuuki-sama's original plan, I have nothing else to say."

Yuuki chatted with Kagali happily.

Seeing this, Mariabell finally realized that she had been deceived by Yuuki.

"You are lying, this is not real. But... Yuuki, did you crack my power?"

It was unbelievable, but Mariabell could only accept this reality. At this point, she was more interested as to how and when Yuuki found a way to overcome the 'Greed' of the 'Greed.'

"---How did you overcome 'Greed'?"

"Are you that curious?"

"Get to the point, answer my question!"

"Hehe, okay then. I'll tell you."

Yuuki looked at Mariabell sympathetically before demonstrating the answer before her.

His emotion had been extremely pure just now, yet suddenly it was clouded by a layer of dark fog---that's what Mariabell saw.

![full page image](image12)

"How can this be... This can't be true, can't be..."

"Ahahahaha! Are you really that surprised? Unfortunately, that's the reality. The answer is that I cracked it from the very beginning. I've been pretending to be under your control the entire time. How about that, wasn't my acting Oscar-worthy?" Yuuki laughed smugly.

In contrast, Mariabell didn't look so good.

"How is this possible, my 'Greed' is...that's the strongest power originating from human emotions---"

Mumbling, Mariabell tried her hardest to make sense of the situation.

Yuuki's laughter didn't fade, even as he concluded, "Your desire was pretty strong, BUT, too bad that my 'Greed' was stronger. My ambition is to become the king of this world and have it as my plaything. I didn't even need to use my 'Anti-Skill' to crack your pathetic 'Greed.'"

Yuuki's laughter wasn't diminishing as he concluded.

To Mariabell, that was her death sentence.

"Don't you look down on me now! I am Mariabell. Mariabell of 'Greed.' People like you are no match for me!" Mariabell shouted as she began to drain all of her soul's energy to attack Yuuki.

Greed Flare---a destructive physical force formed from her strong will struck at Yuuki.

However, it did nothing to him. Yuuki took Mariabell's attack head-on. He mocked her as the dark fog created by the wave dissipated.

"It's useless, you can't win against me."

The next second---

"Cough!"

He pierced through Mariabell's heart with his hand.

It was not over yet, however. Mariabell's power began to leak out and Yuuki started to absorb it.

"Uhh, guha... Could it be...that...you want my power..."

"Bingo."

"H-how... How is that...possible...?"

The light in Mariabell's eyes began to fade. Her hand that held onto Yuuki's wrist lost strength as well.

"Had you been born ten years earlier in this world, perhaps you would already be dominating it. But you were unlucky. Your young body could not use your skill to its full potential, could it?"

"..."

Mariabell did not answer. She looked troubled, and simply stared at Yuuki. And then---

The last shred of light in Mariabell's soul faded and died out.

This is the truth of this world---the weak are doomed to be defeated.

"Didn't you say it yourself, that my ambition is too large. Goodnight, Mariabell. I'll make good use of your greed---"

Mariabell could no longer hear Yuuki's words.

And so, Mariabell's second life in this era of unrest came to an end.

![hard scene break]
After handing the rest of the matter to Shion and the others, I headed out to reinforce Milim.

Right now, I was gazing at the Chaos Dragon.

It was huge, to the point of excessive. By my estimate it was about one hundred meters long. Its gigantic body could even outmatch Charybdis. It was a shocking sight. It also looked like it was consuming the magicule in its surroundings and gradually gaining in size.

It could decimate a mountain with a single breath. It was some tyrant, indeed.

With a monster such as this as our opponent, even we would have to surrender.

However, Milim was different. She used her ultra-large pool of magicule to restrain the Chaos Dragon and prevent it from attacking.

"Sorry to have kept you waiting, Milim!"

"There you are, Rimuru. I've been waiting for you! This is really frustrating for me, because this here is my friend. I was trying to seal him but couldn't do it. If this were to continue it will result in casualties... But I also can't kill my friend!" Milim shouted, sounding upset.

Unlike Charybdis, the Chaos Dragon was one of Milim's valued friends. It was only natural that she didn't want to kill it... Moreover, the Dragon was too large. Even with Milim's power, sealing it had proven difficult.

It was easy to achieve victory, but Milim couldn't bring herself to kill her friend.

I could understand her feelings. I like this Milim.

Which was why I gave her a big smile and told her to rest assured.

"It's all right, I've got a plan!"

"How reliable! What should I do then?"

Milim faced me with shining eyes. She trusted me a lot, even under a lot of stress.

*Don't panic, me.*

I continued to put on a confident air and explained my plan to Milim.

"Listen to me now, no matter how large a monster is, it must have a 'Core.' Why don't you use your precision attacks to knock out the rest of its body until only the core is left?"

It was just like when we tried to save Phobio who was possessed by Charybdis. Milim should be able to avoid attacking the Chaos Dragon's soul.

The astral body and spiritual body that were responsible for protecting the Chaos Dragon's soul had been completely corrupted. Actually, it was the opposite case. It was because of the damage both bodies had suffered that led to it being corrupted by hatred to this extent.

On top of that, with the corruption of Mariabell's 'Greed,' it was incurable.

But perhaps, it was possible to preserve its soul alone.

It used to be Milim's friend, and it could be seen, even if it was just a tiny bit, that its core was fighting hard so that it wouldn't diminish the remaining light in it.

"B-but...it has become so powerful; I probably won't be able to penetrate it without applying enough strength. I may accidentally destroy it completely..."

"Didn't you learn how to control your strength before? Your friend is trying very hard, so you should show the same courage as well!"

I wasn't going to let her find any excuses now.

The most important thing here was courage. If we fail---if we were to have such a notion in mind---what could have been a success, would fail anyway.

"I will assist you. Just follow my instructions and concentrate on unleashing the full force of your magic!"

I was playing cool when I said that I had a plan, but there actually wasn't any. It would all hinge on Milim just toughing it out.

But this was not her first try. I had witnessed her doing it once before and it was very successful. The scale this time was different, but it's the same thing.

"Okay. I have faith in you, Rimuru!"

"Right, just count on me!" I acted all confident.

This would have a huge impact on everyone's mood. The thought of failure alone was extremely scary. But there was no other way. Only I could do this.

*I'll be counting on you, Raphael!*

<<Understood. Leave it to me, my master!>>^[Ruby text: YES MY LORD (never change Fuse)]

I always pushed my responsibilities to other people and was pretty powerless in this situation. Now I really gotta put on an act.

*Don't be afraid of failure. Everything will be fine.* I tried to convince myself.

"It's all right, last time you were successful almost immediately. This time will be the same! Let's go Milim!"

"Yeah! You are right, then here I go, my friend. Watch carefully now, behold the brightness of all the stars in the galaxy! Drago Bustaaa!"

A blinding light was shot out. It felt as if my brain would be burnt to ash even if I closed my eyes.

Milim unleashed a gigantic swirl of power and it went straight at the Chaos Dragon.

Its unknown power formed a barrier that impacted Milim's lightning.

The two powers began to clash.

I analyzed the wave of energy and found the source of the Chaos Dragon's power. I was doing this simultaneously while Raphael-san's analysis helped Milim control her power.

It was so heavy. The power was so heavy. I could tell that my magicules were going down. With this much energy input, the Chaos Dragon still didn't seem to have weakened. What a tough foe. I was almost losing hope, but if we gave up here, everything would go south. All my planning had been for times like these. I believed this deeply and gave it all I had.

On one hand, I tried to calm myself down, and on the other, I slowly tried to get rid of the evil spirit trapping the Chaos Dragon.

The entire process lasted around one second...

However, the heavy, oppressive aura I felt in that one instant seemed to last an eternity.

*I see it!*

The uncontaminated core of the Chaos Dragon. It was still glowing with a dim light.

*I can't just rest yet.*

There was a black fog formed by 'Greed' and an evil spirit of hatred. Even if I extracted all of those, it might still cause some mental corruption later. I had to proceed with extreme caution.

The operation continued.

![break]

All of a sudden, the black fog disappeared. Yuuki must have defeated Mariabell!

"Okay, now we have a chance!"

*I'll use this to win.*

I activated 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth.'

"Milim, let's take this chance to get it done, can you increase your input?"

"Just leave it to me! Raaah, Drago Nova!"

Following my instruction, Milim began to show her true abilities.

This, once again, made me realize just how strong Milim was. How was it possible for her to put in even more power at that point? The fact that she could casually pull off ultimate techniques like these showed that she was on a different level to me.

*Ahh, no no. This is no time to get all impressed.*

"Okay, Chaos Dragon. We will set you free now," I muttered, beginning the final step.

Timing was key.

The spiritual body of the Chaos Dragon had leaked out, and Milim's magic had destroyed it, along with its astral body.

I witnessed all that, and before Milim crushed its core, I needed to execute 'Devour Soul.'

Ignoring time and space, 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' was activated.

As long as I could see, it would finish the job faster than Milim's magic.

And, my plan worked. I successfully obtained the Chaos Dragon's broken core.

![break]

As the 'core' that managed its enormous magicule content disappeared, the Chaos Dragon began to collapse.

But that was precisely the issue.

"R-Rimuru, this is bad! It's going to explode!"

Seeing my signal, Milim stopped her magic. But there was still a gigantic energy field that was powerful enough to warp space left.

The clashing power's collisions had created a super dense energy cluster. It would start to destabilize soon. Sooner or later, it'd cause a huge explosion. Even Milim wouldn't be able to deflect it.

She looked at me anxiously.

But I was not panicking at all. According to Raphael's calculation, I should be able to manage things.

"Don't worry, I'll figure something out!"

"Do you really have a plan?"

Milim was quite shocked.

Her admiring glances were very satisfying, but if I messed this up it would be truly embarrassing---but let's not talk about that possibility now.

*It's gonna be all right, no, Raphael-sensei?* I accidentally asked internally. *Will it get angry at me?*

<<No, there is no problem.>>

As usual, sensei replied calmly. It seemed that it had gone all out as well, how very reassuring.

I gave a smile and set my eyes on what used to be the Chaos Dragon. Nothing but a carcass was left. So, there was no need to hold back.

"Devour it all, Gluttonous King Beelzebuth!"

*Considering how large the energy cluster is, can it really consume it all?*

Beelzebuth began to show its strength, devouring my worries as well. It far exceeded my expectations and ate the thing whole. It's as if nothing had happened.

"Is it over...?"

"No, not yet, we still need to try and save your friend."

"Eh? Can we really save it?"

"Yes. I've prepared just the thing for this type of situation!"

*That's totally a lie!*

I took out an Emulated Soul.

"...?"

Ignoring a confused Milim, I concentrated my will.

*Theoretically, it will work. Indeed, Raphael-san can guarantee that. I just need to put my faith in it.* Straightening my back, I had faith that it would be successful as I began to work.

I needed to pick up every single shred of its broken core and put them in the Emulated Soul. Before that, I utilized my 'Devour Soul' to combine the shreds. It was easier than I had imagined.

The problem was afterward.

Whether the core could safely possess the Emulated Soul...

It wasn't reacting.

I was losing my cool. Even though I looked calm, I was trying my hardest to resolve the matter.

*What should I do now?*

A cliché in many fictions suddenly crossed my mind.

"Milim, does the Chaos Dragon have a name?"

"You mean...a name? That's---"

*It didn't? Shit, I gotta stay calm and figure out something else then...*

"It's called Gaia! I thought of that long ago and was going to name it one day. Its 'name' is Gaia!"

So it did have one. That was reassuring. I whispered the name 'Gaia.' That was a pretty good name.

*Your name is Gaia.*

*Why don't you wake up before your friend starts crying.*

Finally, the Emulated Soul began to glow lightly.

It succeeded. The soul now had a core. I used a Master Core to cover Gaia's Emulated Soul. And there, the Avatar Core was completed. And my work here was finally done.

At this point, time would resolve everything. When the wounds on Gaia's core healed, it would be revived in its ideal form. Gaia wasn't using an avatar; this was its actual body. It would morph into a brand-new monster and be reborn in front of Milim.

"It worked, Milim. This is a brand-new Gaia. It hasn't been born yet, it's like an egg."

I finished as I handed the Avatar Core to Milim.

"Hmm, hmm! I know everything will work out if I leave it to you. I have confidence in you, Rimuru. Thank you, thank you!"

It was great to see how happy she was. Luckily, I didn't fail this time.

But more importantly, I could see Milim's happy smile. It made me happy too.

"Let's head back. Surely, everyone is worried."

"Yeah! I'm gonna tell everyone about my epic battle!"

Yeah yeah.

That being said, thank god Milim was here.

This was not something I could have handled.

![break]

The castle emerged on the horizon. I could see all my companions. They were all waiting eagerly, and I was glad that everyone was all right.

Now the issue had been resolved.

I really wanted to go back and relax a bit.

Take a shower and have a cup of beer.

Filled with joy, Milim and I returned to our party.
