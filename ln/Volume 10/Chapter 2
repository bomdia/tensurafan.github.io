# Chapter 2: The Bustling|Daily Life

Several days passed since our last meeting. A party finally managed to break through Floor 30---it was Masayuki's team. Just as we'd discussed with Myourmiles, their conquest was progressing smoothly. Although this was a complete sham, as long as we don't get caught, it wouldn't be a problem.

Since Masayuki had the Unique Skill 'Chosen One,' even if we slipped up a bit, others would still receive the outcome with a positive spin all on their own. He really was the ideal guy to handle public relations.

Inside the labyrinth, the defeat of the thirtieth floor's guardian, the ogre lord and his five subordinates, was announced with great fanfare.

You could say it worked well. Loud cheers erupted among crowds of people gathered in the inns and bars. "Ma-sa-yu-ki, Ma-sa-yu-ki!!" chants filled the town with a joyful atmosphere.

Masayuki responded to those cheers with a smile. His expression was strained, but in the eyes of the audience, it was the most brilliant smile they could imagine. Masayuki's fame was steadily rising, and his popularity was far from hitting its limit.

Taking advantage of that situation, there were stores with something like 'Hero Masayuki-sama's thirtieth-floor conquest commemoration sale' and the merchants' eyes were glowing with excitement. Along with that, the town became even more lively...

![break]

We gathered in the conference room within the labyrinth again.

"Ara, you seem quite popular, Hero Masayuki-san!"

"Hold on, Rimuru-san, please stop teasing me. You're giving me a hard time!"

It was only meant as a simple greeting, though Masayuki seemed to be genuinely troubled.

"Ahh, you showed spectacular valor in those amazing battles. I was deeply moved as well!" Myourmiles joined in the conversation, and it sounded genuine, to which Masayuki could only respond with a wry smile.

*I see.* No wonder he would get tired seeing this type of reaction all the time.

"But to be honest, I barely did anything."

"Here we go again... You have an outstanding sense of humility, Masayuki-sama."

Masayuki was probably telling the truth as opposed to being humble.

The Ogre King was a monster that fell under rank B-plus, and his subordinates were each rank B as well. Even one rank B monster alone could drive a small village to the verge of extinction. With such a troupe of strong enemies to face off against, it took some genuine strength in order to make it through Floor 30.

Nevertheless, Masayuki's group succeeded with little difficulty. Jinrai's defense went up by equipping the mithril^[Kanji reads Magic Silver (analogous to Magisteel)] full plate armor I gifted to him. Thanks to that, apparently it became a viable strategy to use him as bait. Maybe because the other members were fairly skilled too, they were able to focus on offense and use powerful magic. Bernie's 'Elemental Magic,' Jiwu's 'Spirit Magic,' and compensation effects from Masayuki's 'Chosen'---the combination of these factors had elevated the base power of their team substantially.

Masayuki claimed that he didn't do anything, but he was already helping them by just standing there.

![break]

"And yet... This sounds weird coming from me, but the publicity has been great. In particular, the rare-grade equipment from the special series coming out of the treasure chest was very charming."

"Right? That's what I was thinking."

If you managed to collect the full set of a series, the equipment would gain a special effect---that was among the ideas that I exchanged with Kurobee. He apparently remembered and put together a prototype---that was the Ogre series.

The golden chest in the thirtieth floor's boss room would contain exactly one random item from this series. This was another dirty scheme.

The weapon was randomly selected from among the five types: axe, sword, bow, saber, or knife. As for the armor, it could be a helmet, chest plate, gauntlets, greaves, or boots, but there weren't any shields available.

What you would find depended on your luck. The only certainty was that the gear would be part of the Ogre series. Therefore, whether it would be a weapon or a piece of armor, even that came down to chance. Besides, there was no guarantee that a weapon or piece of armor would drop in the first place, since the golden chest the guardian was guarding was set to only have a two percent chance of containing rare-grade gear. Even if you managed to bring the boss down in one hour, that totaled to opening twenty-four treasure chests in one day. By that calculation, it was fine for rare gear to show up once every two days.

This was optimal to stimulate the gambling spirit. It was human nature to desire collecting things that belonged to a series, and if they happened to receive duplicates, they could always trade or sell them. With this, we could give an extra incentive to challenge the labyrinth.

![break]

"What I got were Ogre Greaves."

"Yeah, you see, if you gather all five armor pieces, it will activate a powerful 'Magic Interference' effect as magic resistance."

This was the same effect that was on the scale shield I had gifted to Kabal. That one could activate the effect on its own, but for these you needed to gather a complete set to unlock it. That was the difference between unique-grade and rare-grade.

To put it bluntly, the weapons and armor of the Ogre series were made from magisteel mixed with the leftover scraps we had after processing the Charybdis scales. That's why the magic resistance effect was pretty strong.

It worked against the tempest serpent's 'Poison Breath' as well, so, by all means, it was worth collecting.

![break]

"Is that so?"

"Yeah. That's why I want you to gather all of them and challenge the next boss, and hopefully, that will become our game plan for the future."

As Masayuki's group broke through floor thirty, the existence of the Ogre series went public, and it was only a matter of time before this information was spread around the world. With this, no doubt, the challengers would be burning with the desire to try their luck. And the sheer number of people wanting to conquer the labyrinth would rise to new heights.

Parties were limited to a maximum of ten people. No matter how strong the troupe of monsters was, if the challengers managed to form a party of rank B and above, then it wouldn't remain an insurmountable opponent. They might fail a few times here and there, but if you considered it as practice against a group of monsters, then this offered a great deal of experience. Like that, I hoped for them to gather powerful gear and set their gaze on the floors ahead.

This was a flawless plan, and everything went according to it.

![break]

"So, if that's the intention...would it be good for me to gather that series, too?"

"Well, that's a tough question. The mithril armor I gave Jinrai is equally rare-grade but has no special ability. However, it offers a higher defense than the Ogre Chest plate. As it is, you probably could beat even the tempest serpent if you really pushed it."

The tempest serpent may have been strong, but you only needed to face one of them. If you challenged it with a party, one person could serve as bait whom you could constantly heal while fighting the monster. In their case, Jinrai would take on that role, but I was sure he'd do just fine.

"Then we'll head straight to the next floor."

"Okay. Your active participation has been a great advertisement, so keep up the good work!"

"Jinrai and my other colleagues are more excited than I am, though. I guess it's more fun now that the monsters drop items. Of course, finding treasure makes me happy, too."

Monsters dropping various items---this suggestion was brilliant. Some monsters, like skeletons, didn't yield any usable materials, and the 'Magic Crystal' was often of poor quality. From those, you could only earn a handful of change, so the higher the people's ranks were, the more of a hassle it would be to them.

But now, the situation had been flipped on its head. Those people who used to begrudgingly fight monsters out of necessity, had started to aggressively hunt them down.

![soft scene break]

The market was booming with the trade of materials, the result was truly magnificent.

It was surprisingly easy to make the monsters that spawned inside the labyrinth drop items. It was the dryads, headed by Treyni-san, that helped make it happen. What they did was force the newly spawned monsters to swallow items whole---putting it that way made it sound like a tough job.

It was difficult to know where monsters would spawn inside the labyrinth. Figuring that out was very tedious. But the truth is, that there was no need to do that.

The amount of magicules flowing to each floor was managed by special pipelines. We set up rooms on the fifth floor and below for these pipes to pass through. That way, we created a system where large hordes of monsters would spawn in specific rooms---these were the so-called monster rooms.

Treyni-san's group, the labyrinth managers, distributed the items I prepared to each room, then released monsters that swallowed them. It would've been a hassle to manage every monster inside the labyrinth, but when narrowed down to just the monster rooms, taking care of them was a piece of cake. Monsters that spawned in the passageways didn't carry any items, but we could wave that problem away by calling them blanks.

Like this, we were able to efficiently deploy monsters with items on each floor.

The way I intended it, the monster room was a kind of trap in its own right. But for now, its bigger purpose was to serve as a room that managed the monsters. Naturally, there would also be those unlucky enough to stumble into the room while it was a crowded monster den...but that, too, was a way to raise the tension.

All things considered, the alluring profits the labyrinth had in store were what everyone was fascinated by.

![break]

"The appraisers are in for a treat! They receive one silver per session, yet the waiting line has no end in sight."

You could find fruit juice and milk with preservation magic applied to keep them fresh for several days, along with low potions, among other things. On the other hand, there were also drinks that spoiled within a few days, so appraisal was a must.

There were also failed works by Kurobee's students; those garbage weapons were being sold at a low price.

It might look like we were operating at a loss, but it was more like a giveaway. We could think of it as reinvesting a portion of our profit to bring in more customers. And speaking of the giveaway, there was a jackpot.

Occasionally, masterworks Kurobee's disciples made would be mixed in. These were an absolute hit, and the number of people who showed off the special-grade gear they earned in the labyrinth increased.

This lavish feast had caught everyone's heart. Like ants attracted to sugar, they challenged the labyrinth day in and out. Items obtained from various treasure chests, prize money for breaking through every tenth floor, and loot from monsters---once the challengers got a taste for these various treats, they soon became regulars.

As you could see, the operation of the labyrinth was going well.

Inevitably, the town was bustling with activity.

![break]

"The ninety-fifth floor is also thriving!" Ramiris triumphantly announced, to which everyone happily nodded.

That's right, we prepared a new inn at the ninety-fifth floor, and this, too, was a smashing success.

We had prominently placed a room in front of the stairs on each floor, featuring an unusual door with the word "inn" inscribed upon it. Next to it, there was a doorbell on the wall, wired up to call a labyrinth manager. Once summoned, they would illustrate the wonders that lay beyond the door.

To open it, you needed but three silver coins. It was the same cost as the labyrinth's entry fee, but for those who toiled away in continuous battles, it was a price they gladly paid. After all, most of the people who heard the pitch ended up using the service.

And there was a definite reason for that: The structure of the labyrinth was ever-changing. Once every two or three days the labyrinth shifted. This made any attempt at challenging the labyrinth far more difficult than it may have seemed.

There were very few people who didn't get lost within the vastness of the labyrinth, and there were countermeasures to prevent the 'Spirit Communication' of spirit-wielders.

Therefore, it became difficult to determine the shortest route. In other words, it was difficult to get to the tenth floor in just one day, forcing many to sleep within the labyrinth's halls.

![break]

"Seriously, this is my first time camping out in the open."

"How'd it go? It sounds quite fun?"

"No, no, it might be all right for you, Rimuru-san, but sleeping on the cold, hard, stone pavement not only makes it easy for you to get sick, but also makes your muscles ache. Although, aside from me and Bernie, the other two lay down comfortably like they're used to it..."

Even Jiwu, being a girl, didn't complain about camping out. However, sleeping while taking turns watching out for monster ambushes seemed to torment Masayuki.

"I see. It must've been very hard."

"Please don't say it like it's none of your business! I'm not gonna sleep there again," Masayuki said with a grimace, likely having flashbacks.

For these modern kids it was apparently too much to ask. This wasn't only a problem among 'Otherworlders,' but the locals had a tough time, too.

Even if you secured a room with a treasure chest and slept inside it, you would need someone to keep watch. There were also those who wandered the labyrinth without ever catching any sleep or taking a rest, so providing a place where they could relax and go to bed was highly appreciated, more than we had thought.

Also, it would've been a waste to dump the gear you had earned to the wayside. This was also part of the plan, because even if it looked like useless items, there was a chance that something good might've been mixed in.

Besides that, food and bedding for several days, replacements and maintenance supplies for gear---they had to bring these necessities, setting a limit on how many of the items they found they would be able to tote along.

When there was no more room to spare, the easiest thing to cut down on was food. Running out of supplies left you with no other option but turning back, however, some of the monsters were edible and could be killed for food. Water could be replenished with the use of magic, leading many to hold out with the bare minimum of rations.

Even in the worst case, as long as you had the Resurrection Bracelet you could get resurrected after death. In those cases, there was a possibility you would lose your items, but that was apparently deemed preferable to starvation.

This brought the spotlight back to the 'Return Whistle,' raising discussions about its usefulness, and, because you could leave with all of your items in hand, there was a great surge in purchases lately.

In that way, to maximize the number of items you could take, reducing the amount of food had become mainstream.

![break]

What if, in that situation, there was an inn that could be used inside the labyrinth?

Merely returning to the stairs was all it took to reach the inn. Doing so, made it redundant to carry food and bedding, allowing you to travel lightly.

If there was an inn available, it was only natural to use it.

A safe resting place was available for three silver coins---the same amount as the labyrinth's entry fee. That was triple the price of those on the surface, so it was a tad expensive, but you were also offered food. And so, with three silver in your pocket, you could use the inn and stay for a night.

The building was divided up between male and female and offered only tiny areas with nothing more than a bed like in a capsule hotel.

To be honest, the service wasn't as good as above ground.

The management of this place was left to the treants, and they used it as a place to train new employees. Cleaning, laundry, cooking and serving the customers. They let the inexperienced trainees get their practice here, and if they passed, they would then be allowed to work on the surface.

Nevertheless, the people who used it would still use it.

You could buy safety in exchange for money, so this was no time to complain. Also, there were fancy additional services available for those who could afford it.

Laundry wash: three silver coins.

Public bath usage: three silver coins.

Gear cleaning and repair: five silver coins.

These were our pricey, exclusive services, and yet, there was a surprising number of customers using them. Constantly fighting in the labyrinth meant you'd inevitably be soaked in blood and sweat. Women, in particular, were bothered by the smell, so baths were greatly welcomed.

For that reason, we raked in a lot more revenue inside the labyrinth than above ground, and the profit margins were excessively higher to boot.

![break]

Even if you didn't use it as an inn, there were times when you just needed a place to take a break and being able to safely use the bathroom without worry seemed to have been a major selling point.

After having it pointed out by Masayuki and digging a little deeper, this seemed to have been giving everyone a hard time.

There were no bathrooms in the labyrinth. When side by side with death, you had to muster the determination to just let it leak if need be.

There was no need to clean up, either, since the monsters that spawned would take care of it on their own. The slimes inside the labyrinth would eat anything and everything. Excrement, monster corpses, or debris, it was all the same to them.

Even when those monsters were slain by the adventurers, a replacement would spawn in no time. Thanks to that, we didn't need to worry about cleaning up after anyone. Besides, every time the structure of the labyrinth shifted, the unnecessary trash was eliminated. And so, surprisingly, the labyrinth was always kept clean and tidy.

Yet in spite of all that, the issue regarding toilets remained.

From the labyrinth management's perspective, having the whole place stink was a 'shitty' situation. But as if that weren't bad enough, the challengers had another problem to deal with: getting attacked by a monster at your most defenseless state of times, that would likely drive anyone to tears. You could shout "Time out!" all you wanted, but the monsters held themselves to no such courtesies.

For both numbers one and two, you'd always need someone keeping watch. But you may feel ill at ease when quickly doing your business while your partners were protecting you.

Maybe less so when you only had to take a leak---no, definitely both would be unpleasant.

Now imagine monsters showing up at the same time, that would be the absolute worst time for a fight.

Soiling your pants during combat---I don't even want to imagine it.

If that happened to you, the first impulse would be to run back to your group that very instant, but to have them see you wetting your pants before their eyes, what an absolute humiliation. A man might laugh it off, but this would, surely, be a life-or-death situation for a woman. At worst, I'd bet some would rather choose death in those instances.

Mixed parties of men and women weren't uncommon either, so it was no surprise that the inns would see a lot of visitors, considering the toilet situation.

![break]

Incidentally, there were those who took care of it with the help of some magic. They said that they managed their condition with the use of daily magic 'Health Care' or 'Clean Wash' within the labyrinth. 'Health Care' was said to help you manage your bowel movements. Although there was a limit, I heard that they could hold it for about three days with no problem.

For everyone who didn't fancy wetting themselves during battle, this was said to be an essential spell. Nonetheless, one would be remiss to forget about its limit. If you planned to wander the labyrinth for a long time, relying on magic alone would be like playing shitty Russian roulette.

And so, even those who could cast magic gradually used the inns as well.

![soft scene break]

As it stood, the management of the labyrinth was going very smoothly.

Myourmiles gave the income report with a gleeful look on his whole face, "Things are going smoothly, ladies and gentlemen. Revenue has been steadily climbing. Even after deducting the necessary expenses, such as the loot items distributed in the labyrinth, we are still making enough profit. As for the return on our investment, we're currently at around ten percent. We are aiming for twenty percent, and seeing as the number of users increases, I predict we will be able to achieve it."

*Hmm Hmm, everything is roughly as expected.*

The loot was valued at its market selling price in these calculations, not the raw production costs, meaning that the real profit margin was even higher. Not only that, but the residents working in the city were not being paid a single copper, letting all of the money flow straight into the state treasury.

"Looks like it's all right to increase my investments."

"If we do that, we might have to wait a while before the country becomes profitable, but it would not take long to be in the black."

If all we wanted was to turn a profit, we could've simply sold goods we produced at a high price, but that alone didn't make us a legitimate nation.

There were people engaged in various jobs around town, and only when the work was appropriately divided, could everyone do their best. Therefore, I thought it to be important to create an environment where everyone could work with a sense of pride and accomplishment. Work for every citizen of this country---in other words, it was my job as king to offer them a worthwhile life.

---That being said, I didn't think it was good to continue the status quo.

"But, you know, not getting paid is a bit..."

"In fact, our funds are sufficient to cover paying everyone a salary equivalent to the average salary in the kingdom of Blumund. It's just that people haven't taken it..." Myourmiles said with a bitter smile.

As a merchant, it would be out of the question for Myourmiles to work free of charge. It was a feeling I could deeply sympathize with. Going without a paycheck was a glaring issue on so many levels. We guaranteed food, clothing and housing, and everyone seemed to be happy with that, and yet... This was verging on outright exploitation, so it was about time to pay them what they were owed.

I was thinking about it, but Raphael-san was perfectly managing it for me. And probably thanks to that, there weren't any complaints piling up. There would have to be discussions about the matter with Rigurd and the other three officials.

![break]

While the residents were satisfied despite the lack of pay, there were those who were true to their desires.

"Th-then there won't be an issue with my paycheck, right?" Ramiris asked with a gulp.

With all of that talk about withholding wages, she seemed to be worried that her share was gone too.

I was a man of my word; such worries were uncalled for. So, I signaled to Myourmiles with a glance. In response, Myourmiles grinned and nodded vigorously, followed by a pompous announcement, "You may have high expectations! Mark my words, we will pay you handsomely."

Ramiris wore a broad grin on her face after hearing that.

"So, it's finally here."

"Hmm? What is?"

"The time, the age! My era has finally come!"

*I wonder*. *I don't think such an era has come.*

Ramiris laughed with a shrill voice while saying that. Treyni came by to bring her tea and had the same joyful expression... She seemed a bit overprotective and heavy on the love...but that wasn't any of my business.

"Speaking of paychecks, don't I get one too?"

Annoyingly enough, Veldora had also awoken an interest in money. I figured this was the time to pay up. Myourmiles glanced at me, and I returned a slight nod.

"Of course, we have it prepared. Would you agree to receive the same amount as Ramiris-sama?"

As a matter of fact, I had already discussed this with Myourmiles. After all, Veldora was employed as the king of this labyrinth. It may have looked like he wasn't doing anything, but we were actually relying on Veldora's leaking magicules to maintain the environment of the labyrinth.

Turning iron ore into magisteel alone already drove major profits. So, I didn't want to be stingy and thought that it would be right to properly compensate them.

"Oh, ohhh! Is that so? As expected of Rimuru. I can feel relieved knowing you'll take care of it."

"Don't waste it on unnecessary things."

"Uh, of course not!"

"Of, of course! I know what saving is, too!"

Knowing something didn't mean much if you didn't put it into action. That's what I thought, but I didn't want to rain on their parade.

"Hahaha, no harm in spending some. You gotta feel the joy of spending it first to appreciate the effort of saving it."

"Right?! Myourmiles-chan, you know that well!"

*Myourmiles, if you pamper Ramiris she will get carried away. I'd hope you see Treyni-san as a bad example and learn from it.*

"What of it? I also have experience working at the takoyaki shop. I understand the value of working and the importance of money. Rimuru, you worry too much!"

*What's with your smug attitude? It was me who set up the takoyaki shop, and it was Myourmiles who actually did the work. You were just frying takoyaki!*

I would have liked to lash out, but I got a grip.

Well, you live and you learn. Let the two of them do as they wish. Even if they failed, they could learn something from it, and that's okay.

![break]

I knew that the town was flourishing, but I wondered what the internal situation was really like. I was concerned about that, so I decided to pose the question, "By the way, Myourmiles-kun, how are things going outside the labyrinth?"

Myourmiles's face lit up.

"It's lively---that one word says it all. The festival has already ended but I don't see a big change in the population. It is safe to assume that the merchants are now on a steady stream."

"In other words, does that mean that this town has started to become a trading hub?"

"That's right. The merchants looking to do business have begun to pay me visits. Not all of them were coming through connections, so Rigurd-dono seems to have been busy handling correspondences. Ranging from those affiliated with the Freedom Association to wealthy merchants in Western countries, inquiries about opening a shop have been stacking up."

That seemed to be going more smoothly than I had thought. We succeeded in bringing people over with the Tempest Debut Festival as the spark. On top of that, the labyrinth that we created for fun enjoyed surging popularity and was able to win the hearts and minds of visitors.

All that's left was to direct the money into a smooth flow.

We let those who challenged the labyrinth earn money and consume our country's goods. Products included not only lodging and meals but also weapons, armor, and supplies. Naturally, merchants from other countries would also play a part there. The Freedom Association would buy up the monster materials and pour money back into our country. Merchants from foreign lands would bring various kinds of rare goods. By the time that happened, the town would be bustling with activity.

In the meantime, our country would earn a reputation for the excellent products made here. We had a wide selection of local specialties to offer, many of them were culinary ingredients and alcohol, along with the countless dishes Shuna developed with them. There were also various kinds of weapons and armor made in Kurobee's workshop. Now that several of Kaijin's disciples were working together, a variety of products were available. There were many other things too, but I was sure there would be more yet to come.

It spread by word of mouth, and even without putting much effort into advertising the product, customers would surely come. And as a result, this country was bound to become recognized and required by many.

But wait, there's more.

Some of the gear that came from Kurobee's workshop was displayed in markets as this city's specialty product. The armaments traded there would also attract a lot of attention. They were sold by different shops depending on the quality, but high-performance equipment could be bought if you had the right amount of cash. Though, when it came to rare-grade and above equipment, I only planned to exhibit it on the ninety-fifth floor of the labyrinth.

Some might question its performance, but that wasn't a big deal. After all, there was a place close by where you could try out the products you bought. There were still only a handful of people using this service, but we did offer rental gear for challengers as well. And it would only be a matter of time before news of how great the quality of the products was, would spread on its own.

And so, little by little, the trust in this country piled up.

Credibility was more important than profit. I didn't think that we had to run a deficit to gain credibility, but if we are in the black overall, we could call it a success. Our goal was not to make money, but to get this country recognized on the world stage.

![break]

"It is as we expected. The merchants still approach us in spite of Tempest being a kingdom of monsters, because they can smell the profits. The number of challengers continues to grow, and it seems we have an opportunity to get along with the Western Nations."

Accepting my wishes, Myourmiles nodded as well.

"There doesn't seem to be a problem. The number of customers is increasing steadily. This is with the knowledge that this is a monster country ruled by a demon lord. We can safely assume that we've gained credibility, just as Rimuru-sama intended," he agreed emphatically.

Besides, Myourmiles was a really interesting man.

*"We," huh?* From that statement, you could tell that even though he was a human, his thought process was entirely from our perspective.

*That does put a smile on my face.*

Credibility is not something you can earn at the drop of a hat. As they say, trust is a fragile thing---hard to gain but easy to lose. Few words were truer than that.

Although we attracted people by stimulating their desires, it was another matter to gain their trust. If they regarded us as someone who satisfied their desires, that meant you had gained their trust.

Myourmiles is a good example, we were bound by a trusting relationship built upon desire.

Do a good job and reap the proper benefits---I believed this to be important.

Of course, pursuing your desires one-sidedly is an unpleasant way to go about it. You must look deeply into a person's character to gauge if they're worthy of trust. This was the perfect time to hone that very skill.

With Myourmiles as the teacher, there was still lots for me to learn.

![soft scene break]

After that, I gave Ramiris and Veldora their pay; the two of them looked happy. I *did* tell them not to waste it, *but do they even think about what they're buying?*

Despite these doubts, the discussion carried on.

Now that the labyrinth was on track, I was thinking about devoting myself to the things I loved.

The research facility, which was newly prepared on the one-hundredth floor, was divided into several compartments. At present we had laboratories headed by Gabil and facilities where Ramiris conducted her personal research.

"Um, could you prepare a facility for me as well?"

"Fine, but are you going to do some research as well, Rimuru?"

"No, in my case, it's development. I've got a lot of things on my mind, so I thought I'd make them."

When it came to research, Kurobee was working much more diligently than I was. His workshop was located in the southwest part of the city, and the surrounding area was lined with the workshops of disciples who were recognized as master craftsmen.

It was said that some artisans who heard the rumors had taken up residence there, and some even opened their own workshops. These people were also repairing equipment, and now it was a kind of industrial area.

Therefore, the technology developed there was nigh impossible to hide. This was a place where everyone could share and learn from each other in a friendly competition---that was no place to conduct confidential research and development.

What I asked Kurobee was to make armor and technical stuff, which no one else could feasibly imitate.

Besides, I didn't need the space to do any research, all thanks to Raphael-sensei. That's why I wanted a place to set up the development, based on the diagrams I had completed in my brain.

"Okay! I'll have it ready for you today!" Ramiris readily agreed to my request.

And with that, the lowest floor, the one-hundredth floor underground, the one that began as the great hall of Veldora, became a large space with various research facilities.

Viewing it from the perspective of defense as well as leak prevention, there was no other place that guaranteed this level of security. It was truly impregnable.

From now on, important projects would be carried out in this location.

![break]

"So, Rimuru, just what are you trying to make?"

"It's a secret."

"What? You always make the strangest things, so I'm quite curious."

"That's right. There should be no secrets between you and me!"

*What nonsense... Ramiris and Veldora are always up to something behind my back. But when it comes to this, these two are persistent.*

Deceiving them was even more of a hassle, so I decided to give them a proper answer.

"It's about bodies. I'm planning to make one for Treyni-san's sisters to use."

In truth, I was thinking about preparing the quantity Diablo had requested as well. When it came to amounts around one thousand, making them by hand would've been a herculean task. With this in mind, I wanted a facility capable of mass production.

"Make it big; I have quite a lot of things I want to try out."

"Okay. Since it's for *my subordinate*, I'll do what I can to help!"

Putting an emphasis on the subordinate part, Ramiris accepted my request.

*Hee hee, it was right to only give half of the truth. With this, I'll be able to experiment to my heart's content.*

Until now, the idea was just floating in my head, without the spare time to make it happen. Finally, I could dive into developing it. I grinned at the thought.

![soft scene break]

A couple more days passed.

I was engrossed in installing the equipment for the development. I could finally get to work after looking forward to this for a long time, and incorporated Raphael-san's input as it replicated a bunch of stuff in my 'Stomach.'

If these had been bits of technology that were meant to be passed on to future generations, I would never have done things the way I did. But I didn't intend to share this tech with the public in the first place, so I didn't restrain myself and created whatever I wanted.

It was then that someone called for me from outside.

*And just when I thought that I was beginning to be productive*---

<<Report. You have been cut off from outside communication for several days. Something might have happened.>>

Now that Raphael-san had pointed it out, I realized that I wasn't even eating anything. I was too absorbed in what I was doing, and I didn't realize that until Raphael-san stepped in to make me aware of it. Even if nothing happened, Shuna and Shion would have been worried about me, nonetheless.

It just so happened that my work was done, for now, *I guess it's time for me to show up for a change.*

![break]

I answered the call and stepped outside the R&D facility. It was indeed Shuna and Shion on the other side.

"Rimuru-sama, is everything all right?"

"I was worried sick. You always looked forward to dining, yet you haven't shown up for mealtime in the past few days. We were just wondering if something had happened to you."

They really *were* worrying about me.

"Sorry, I got a little too focused here."

"I-it's all right! As long as you are fine---"

"Shion is right. You have always been working hard. And even if Rimuru-sama acts more free-spiritedly, people won't really complain."

Knowing that I was all right, Shion and Shuna smiled.

*I need to seriously reflect on myself for having them worried this time.*

"From today onward, I will show up every day."

"I will be very happy if you would do that."

*I suppose. I really need to stop getting carried away with my interests.* But merely knowing that someone was worried about me cheered me up.

Halfway through my introspection, Shion suddenly recalled something and began to mutter: "Speaking of which, Myourmiles-san has been looking for Rimuru-sama since yesterday."

Eh?

"If that was the case, couldn't you just come and find me."

"We did, but you weren't responding... Sorry, we should have shouted a bit louder."

"Ah, it's okay. I was the one at fault. It's all because I got lost in thought. I will prepare something like a call bell for such occasions in the future."

It seemed that Shion didn't think it was anything urgent, but seeing that Myourmiles was still looking for me to that day, she became anxious and went to discuss it with Shuna. Moreover, Shion further mentioned that what Myourmiles wanted to talk about had to do with the labyrinth, yet he didn't tell her the details.

*Did he feel that she wouldn't understand or was it something that he couldn't tell Shion*---Myourmiles's thoughts were intriguing.

Speaking of which, Diablo may have been more qualified than I had expected. In times like this, Diablo would have definitely come to call me out. He might've gone so far as to just come in by himself. Now that I think about it, Diablo was probably even more stubborn than Shion.

*But let's put that thought aside. I should go find Myourmiles.*

Shuna made me some packed sandwiches, and Shion made me some black tea.

![break]

While enjoying my food, I waited for Myourmiles's arrival.

"Oh oh, Rimuru-sama! I've been looking for you. Something terrible has happened!" Myourmiles burst out in panic before me, quite unlike my own casual attitude.

"What, what happened?"

*Did we get complaints from customers?* I thought as I asked.

"There have been other people who made it through Floor 30, after Masayuki-san."

"Wow, that's impressive. They are progressing faster than I expected."

"Now's not the time for such idle chit chat! They are progressing at lightning speed and are already approaching the fortieth floor's boss room!"

*Woah, wow-wow.* Indeed, now wasn't the time for chilling. But I didn't think such panic was warranted.

Upon coming to that conclusion, what Myourmiles said next changed my mind on the matter, "Their strategy is bordering on foul-play, moving in grey areas that could potentially violate the labyrinth rules. For instance---"

And so on and so forth, Myourmiles continued without pause.

Seriously, this was unexpected.

.........

......

...

It looked like these people were good at using Ramiris's items.

First, before they went to fight the guardian of Floor 20, they used a Recording Crystal. This item applied to a full squad, so even if they were wiped out, they could still respawn at the save point that they registered.

All of those item uses were in line with my expectations. This on its own was fine, but, on top of that, they were also using a 'Return Whistle' to leave the labyrinth as a squad. Following that, they would disband the squad and then each member would find additional teammates to form a new squad, with a maximum number of ten members.

"Let's see, this way the total number would be---"

"Indeed. These are no longer just a couple squads, their size is more comparable to a small army."

With ten squads in total, that added up to one hundred challengers. Every single one of them boasted a strength of at least rank C-plus to B-plus. I heard that they were also wearing the same type of jacket embroidered with some sort of symbol. All of these people grouped together in style. Almost as if they were trying to show everyone else how "strong" they were, they marched onward through the labyrinth. And of course, it was said that all members had appeared before the guardian of Floor 30. These challengers were also divided into squads, ten in total, each of them taking turns.

The ogre lord and his five subordinates were a powerful company, but those challengers weren't rookies either. And in the end, even though it was a tough battle, these people still made it through Floor 30 with their third squad of challengers.

.........

......

...

"Didn't something similar happen lately?"

"Your Majesty has sharp senses; their group was the Green Rebellion."

*I see, of course they were behind it.* Wearing the same type of jacket with the same symbols. Were they sent by some noblemen? Considering how often these people were using a Recording Crystal, I couldn't help but shiver. *Well, the saying goes, "Time is money"---but to simply use a disposable item that costs as much as one gold coin without a flinch...*

"Did that symbol reveal what noble house they belong to?"

"I asked Souka-san to investigate. They seemed to be a famous mercenary group known as the Apostles of Verte. Their sponsors seem to come from the Kingdom of Ingracia."

*Apostles of Verte, never heard of them.* On the other hand, the central kingdom of the Western Nations was suddenly interested in the labyrinth in our nation---this was a lot more surprising to me. During the Debut Festival, there seemed to be nobles from lower houses in attendance...but I don't suppose there were any from the royal house.

*Did they fear letting someone get ahead of them? Or were they up to something else*---

"How should I put it, I suppose... The attitude they had, essentially that money makes the mare go, left a sour taste in people's mouths. Nevertheless, they weren't violating any rules."

What was giving us a headache, was that we had no reason to kick them out. I could understand why Myourmiles was nervous. At this point, there was really nothing we could do.

"We are profiting from it, so there's really nothing to complain about. But these people will probably tear through the floors designed by Rimuru-sama..."

In other words, during my shut-in period, Myourmiles wanted to see me because he was afraid that these people would conquer the labyrinth.

"Take a look at yourself, you're shaken to the bone. It shouldn't be an issue. After all, what lies beneath Floor 40 is the real deal. Getting there still won't be a cake walk though, beating the tempest serpent is no small feat."

The squad Green Rebellion displayed immaculate teamwork, so, if I had to guess, that team had the strength equivalent of rank A-minus. Although I still had my doubts, considering their individual strength was only rank B. They would probably be unable to resist a powerful area attack.

The tempest serpent was very powerful among the rank A-minus monsters. So, it should take more than ten B-plus members to defeat it.

"However, according to Ramiris-sama and Veldora-sama, the captain of the team Green Rebellion appears to have lied about his actual abilities..."

*Eh?! From footage alone, I can't really run an accurate 'Analyze and Assess,' but*---

<<Report. Applying 'Analyze and Assess' on battle footage alone cannot calculate the magicule content of the target.>>

That was the advice Raphael-san gave me. We could solely analyze the video footage and infer the equivalent monster (adventurer) ranking established by the Freedom Association. But we were unable to calculate the team's absolute level of ability.

For instance, my registered rank was B-plus, yet my actual ability was at rank S. That's just how it was, sometimes your true level of ability didn't match up with your ranking. Moreover, it was even more difficult to tell when someone was faking it. This would be something I needed to figure out countermeasures for.

"I want to hear what Veldora and the others have to say."

"Leave it to me. I've already contacted all of them. Let's talk in some other place."

As expected from Myourmiles. The moment I left the room, he had already contacted Veldora and the others.

I nodded and stood up from my seat.

![soft scene break]

Everyone gathered in the meeting room inside the labyrinth---the usual guys, of course.

"You were so slow, Rimuru!"

"Yeah, that's right! You are the captain, you know, gotta do better than this!"

*I'm the captain? First time I've heard of it. But that's not the point now.*

"Well then, what's the current situation?"

"It's gotten really dire. They have already made their way to Floor 38."

Ramiris rendered the raider's progress into video footage as she spoke. She looked distraught and flustered as she worked to visualize the situation. It was like a bunch of tiny models moving around in a transparent box. They were extremely delicate 3D projections.

*If only I could use this to perform a direct 'Analyze and Assess'...*

<<Proposal. If permission to interfere with the individual Ramiris's Intrinsic Skill 'Labyrinth Creation' is granted, more accurate intelligence could be extracted.>>

Oh oh, it was rare of Raphael-san to suggest something. It looked like it was worth a try, *let's ask her right away.*

"Ramiris-kun, may I ask you a favor?"

"Eh? Why are you getting so serious all of a sudden?"

"The thing is, I want to interfere with your 'Labyrinth Creation,' is that okay?"

"Interfere? How are you going to interfere with it?"

Even if you asked me---I certainly had no clue.

"By interfere I mean interfere. I just want to collect all sorts of information from the labyrinth, I guess?"

I casually threw out some contrived nonsense in an attempt to bamboozle Ramiris.

<<Report. That was basically it.>>

*Hoho, I am a genius after all.*

It seemed that I correctly interpreted Raphael-sensei's idea.

"I guess you may, but can you endure all that?"

"Eh, me? Why are you worrying about me now?"

"Not really, but the thing is, that the amount of information within my labyrinth is huge. Even I can't grasp all of it, that's why I usually just delete most of that stuff."

*Uh-huh, wait a minute?* An immense amount of information---just like she pointed out, it was indeed filled to the brim. There were already more than a thousand challengers using the labyrinth at that very moment, in addition to the many items on various floors, not to mention the residents on Floor 95. And all of this would be handled by---

<<Answer. No problem.>>

*Ah, yeah. No problemo indeed.*

"Uh...no...problem...?"

"Why do you sound like you're full of doubt?"

"Well then, you don't have to pursue it, Ramiris. Just go ahead and hand the matters to Rimuru. No more need to worry about it!"

I wasn't even sure about it myself before Ramiris was suddenly convinced by Veldora.

"I got it! Then I'll give Rimuru the access to interfere with my 'Labyrinth Creation'!" Ramiris declared and reached out to touch me.

And with that, I was easily connected to the labyrinth.

<<Report. Established connection with the Intrinsic Skill 'Labyrinth Creation' of individual 'Ramiris.' Proceeding to gather intelligence.>>

As if it was already on the edge of its seat, Raphael-san launched its operation. And in that same instant, it felt as though a tidal wave of information flooded into my brain---though it had no ill effect on my body. I had tensed up in anticipation, yet it was all for nothing.

<<Report. 'Analyze and Assess' of team Green Rebellion has concluded. The captain's abilities exceed rank A. The analysis of the remaining members deviates by a negligible amount from the previous appraisal.>>

It looked like Raphael-san was able to get the necessary information in a moment's notice. What a reliable sensei indeed. But for some reason, Raphael-san seemed to be continuing its 'Analyze and Assess,' *was there something else on its mind?*

<<Answer. Currently analyzing all on-going battles within the labyrinth--->>

I felt like I was being told to stay out of the way.

Right. Ordinary men such as I had not the faintest idea of what Raphael-sensei was up to. I believed it must've been doing something really rad again, so I let it do its thing undisturbed.

Speaking of which, let's get back on track.

![break]

"I see."

"What did you see, Rimuru?"

"That was fast, so he really couldn't handle it...?"

Ignoring Veldora's usual demeanor, Ramiris was gazing at me with doubt in her eyes. Although she had good reason to do so, I was slightly offended, and, therefore, declared my discovery with a slice of arrogance: "That guy looks to be above rank A."

I presented footage that was quite unlike the feed displayed by Ramiris and continued to enlarge the images.

"EH!" Everyone seemed surprised, but Ramiris was the one that was hit the hardest.

"H-hold up, Rimuru? How did you figure out how to use my Skill?"

"Hahaha, after you gave me access to interfere, I just suddenly learned how to use it."

"No way! Even I can only broadcast specific locations and people that I've checked on before..."

Apparently, Ramiris could only project images that the labyrinth managers could see. No wonder why it was difficult to verify intelligence in detail.

"Ahh, don't be a stranger. I'm just good at this type of thing."

While pacifying Ramiris by saying that, I turned my eyes to the projector.

Speaking of the person above rank A, he was the captain of the team Green Rebellion, a spirit-wielder. Given how much power he had been hiding, surely, he would be able to utilize many spirits. If this guy were capable of wielding greater spirits, his power would definitely have stood to increase many times over.

"Oh, so the 'above rank A' you said was in comparison to the ranking of monsters?"

"Yep, that's the standard set by the Freedom Association in order to determine which people of a certain rank can defeat what type of monster."

Yet they never considered the relative safety of such a battle. In my memory, stipulated by the association's rules, multiple adventurers were to confront a monster of the same rank.

"Then what rank is my team?"

"You guys, let me see..."

Masayuki's rank was a tad ambiguous. Honestly, I thought that he would still be considered a rank D loser. But Masayuki's Unique Skill was ridiculously over-the-top, so the whole team may easily have added up to beyond rank A. But saying this directly to Masayuki could easily be misunderstood, so I should save it for another time.

Right now, it was best to try and make something up.

"Jinrai barely made it to rank A. Although I'm unsure whether he could defeat the tempest serpent alone, it should be a piece of cake if he had the ogre series."

Not even mithril full plate armor could completely protect one against 'Poison Fog,' making the tempest serpent a tough enemy for him. Unlike monsters, humans had all kinds of weaknesses. This was, of course, no video game; the possession of resistance could be a matter of life and death. Despite being on equal footing in terms of strength, one can easily succumb to a lethal dose of poison.

"Jinrai sure is impressive."

"Isn't he? However, a lot of that is due to your Skill buffing Jinrai's abilities through the roof. Aren't the rest of your comrades a girl, named Jiwu, and Bernie? Both of them are also rank A-minus."

A very balanced and strong team. This was probably the reason why Masayuki was never shown in a bad light before.

"All thanks to my reliable teammates."

"Hahaha, Masayuki-sama must be stronger than all of his companions. I think he can be easily evaluated as above rank A. Since you are, after all, the Hero recognized by Rimuru-sama!"

Myourmiles gazed at Masayuki with admiration.

*Please don't act like that*.

Masayuki was torn between laughing and crying again because of it.

"But here's the problem: not only was this one member of the Green Rebellion that strong, the guy next to him is also rank A. They are the mercenary group Apostles of Verte, right? Seems like an organization with many skilled warriors."

"There's no way! Where did all of these elites come from?"

"Umm, to me they're still pushovers, but..."

After putting some thought into it, I figured that, if these people were to team up, they could have easily broken through Floor 50.

"Gozer and Mezer are both rank A. But it may be too much for either of them to handle these two people at once. Moreover, that captain of Green Rebellion seems to rival Gozer and Mezer in strength."

"Is he really that strong?"

"Indeed. By the way, those two guys are also twice as strong as Jinrai. This is ignoring techniques however, a purely physical comparison."

The two guys, approaching the strength to rival the captain, were also powerful enough to stand against greater majins. Right now, they seemed to be weaker than our ol' pal Gelmud, though stronger than the lesser skilled Holy Knights.

The captain of Green Rebellion stood head and shoulders above the rest, and although this is my assumption, he was more experienced in combat as well.

"Even the traps I specifically set for them were taken out by the beasts they summoned. These people are good at this."

"Yeah, if this were to continue, they will eventually end up on the floor I prepared."

"How terrible, it will be bad if this continues."

"Huh?"

I thought those two would have been happier, were they worrying about something? I was pretty pissed by the fact that my own traps were getting thwarted, but, by all accounts, these two should've been looking forward to challengers. Moreover, since a short while ago, Ramiris's face had been filled with panic; were they hiding something from me?

"Is there something you aren't telling me?" I asked straight up.

And soon, Veldora and Ramiris turned to look at each other, before Ramiris seemingly decided to be straight with me and began to talk.

"The thing is, during the three days you stayed in your room..."

And following the things that came out of her mouth, my head began to hurt as I listened.

![soft scene break]

According to Ramiris, the Holy Knight Order had begun their training. They started from Floor 51. Floors 51 to 60 were trapped by Ramiris, and she was excited to see the results.

Adalmann, who had been appointed as the guardian of the sixtieth floor, had summoned hordes of undead monsters. As a result, Ramiris created ferocious traps, such as hallways filled with endlessly respawning waves of the undead, or entire rooms devoid of oxygen, something undead monsters had no use for anyway.

"I was quite confident in those traps! But they were easily purified by the Holy Knights. The oxygen-free room got the better of them, but the people following immediately came to their rescue, reviving them..."

"They were a direct counter to one another, that can't really be helped," I said to comfort a dejected Ramiris as I continued to listen to her report.

The Holy Knight Order made its way to the boss room of Floor 60. Adalmann was waiting there but was also beaten to a pulp by his opponents. I had come to expect that.

After losing his power, he became a mere wight. I could only hope for him to be of use as a summoner, because the Holy Knights were too much for him alone to handle. Be that as it may, Adalmann should've been considered a senpai to the Holy Knights. Getting beaten by his juniors was enough to dishearten even a dead man...

"Was he really frustrated about it?"

"Super frustrated..."

*Ah yeah, of course. I should go comfort him later.*

"Then, what happened next?"

"After they beat Adalmann, they continued onward to the floors I trapped myself. I was gonna enjoy a show, thinking that they would be faced with a tough battle---"

"The infuriating part is that all of Mentor's traps were evaded as well! The sliding floors, illusory walls, pitch-black hallways, light beams of death, and many more I can't even think of, were all overcome by them."

Veldora and Ramiris gritted their teeth in frustration as they gave their reports.

Veldora prepared floors sixty-one to seventy with a lot of care. Although there were casualties among the Holy Knight Order, those who weren't immediately killed were promptly revived. Moreover, with the Resurrection Bracelet, the Holy Knights weren't particularly concerned about the dangers.

And here I thought that the difficulty had been set too high... It seemed that any squads of soldiers above rank A could recover as long as one of them was left standing. Now we really had to re-evaluate and re-adjust the difficulty.

"But my Elemental Colossus worked really hard. After improving upon the one you broke, my new one is super strong, and it killed all the challengers. However..."

*Very impressive.* It was able to take out all of the Holy Knights; it packed one hell of a punch. Though, that really was to be expected.

Its abilities alone were a threat. It could shrug off both swords and magic, coupled with its massive size, yet agile motion---this wasn't an opponent any average person could take on.

*But if it's that strong, then why is Ramiris so upset...?*

"About that, one of the valiant members of the Holy Knights said something that was pretty embarrassing to Hinata-sama. Probably out of spite, one of the challengers, Fritz-sama, commented: 'I think even Hinata-sama would fail at conquering this labyrinth,'" Myourmiles answered my doubt with a wry smile.

*I see, had Hinata been part of the force, even the Elemental Colossus wouldn't have been able to stop her. I should ask---*

"So, how far did Hinata get...?"

"Uh..."

"That's the main problem!"

I was shocked after hearing what happened---Hinata made it to Floor 95 on her first day. Although she started from Floor 61, this was still extremely fast.

She easily immobilized the Elemental Colossus and instantly destroyed it using 'Disintegration.' And then she made her way down to Floor 80 in one go and easily took care of the guardian there.

"My disciple Zegion was in a cocoon at the time; he was in no condition to move. Apito had already awoken though and was there to face her. Yet that woman, Hinata, was too quick for Apito to react, and defeated her."

"She was really strong. Apito is a queen wasp, after all. Her speed is unmatched among all monsters. Apito tried her best fighting Hinata, but even with that speed, her every move was seen through by that woman."

![full page image](image4)

*Yeah, well. This was Hinata, she could certainly pull that off.* I already found it pretty incredible to have won against her. That was how strong Hinata was.

"From there, that woman continued to make great strides. All of Kumara's subordinates guarding Floors 81 to 89 were defeated by her one by one."

"Moreover, since Kumara is still young, we let Beretta stand in as the guardian of the ninetieth floor, but he didn't stand a chance, either."

"I see... Beretta does seem to have become stronger than before, but such an opponent was still too challenging for him."

"Mm-hmm, Hinata is so incredibly strong, it makes me wonder why she isn't a Hero."

I heard that Hinata had spent that night very elegantly on the ninety-fifth floor. And yesterday, she broke through Floors 96 to 99 in one go---the supposedly super-tough dragon chambers that Milim was proud of.

"By the way, on the terrain effect floors, there are not only earthquakes, there is also heavy gravity! It's been cranked up to five times the normal strength; you're supposed to have a hard time moving around."

Lightning strikes from above, icy winds that freeze you to the bone, burning heat that scorches your skin---none of this left a mark on Hinata.

"And in the end, at last, it was my turn to fight."

"Seriously? Did you actually fight her?"

"Yep, as the king of the labyrinth, I welcome all challengers. As the final boss, I will neither run nor hide!"

"---And, how'd it go?"

Of course, Veldora wouldn't run or hide. But apart from that, I was more concerned about the result. Veldora was stronger than me, so the thought of him losing didn't even cross my mind. Rather, I was curious about how Hinata had fought.

"Of course I won. She was really strong though. Her swordsmanship was very similar to the Hero that sealed me, yet her fighting style was the opposite."

*Hmm-hmm.* It came as no surprise that Veldora won, but it was a shame that I didn't get to see the fight play out.

*Ah ah, I really hope there are at least some records left...*

<<Answer. Unfortunately, all combat records were deleted.>>

*I see... Darn it, I'm such an idiot for missing something so important.*

"But seriously, the fight was mesmerizing. As expected from Hinata-sama, she put up an amazing fight."

*Did Myourmiles get to see it? I'm jealous.*

"Hinata-san sure was strong... Even though everyone argues over which one of us is stronger, to be honest, I feel sick every time I hear such a conversation."

"Wahahaha, how modest of you, Masayuki-sama."

*Myourmiles-kun...that's not modesty, it's nothing more than his honest feelings.*

"Hahaha, please stop joking like that, Myourmiles-san."

Masayuki tried to play dumb with a rigid smile hung on his face. Yet Myourmiles kept on singing his praises, not realizing Masayuki's desperation.

"I see, I see. Surely, you must be saying that this is no casual matter to discuss. Indeed, if Masayuki-sama and Veldora-sama were truly to fight, it would undoubtedly be a battle on a scale yet unseen by man. Please allow me to watch when the time comes."

Usually, Myourmiles was good at reading people's thoughts, yet under such circumstances, his moronic antics were pushing Masayuki to the brink.

*Please stop. Masayuki's dying over there!*

"Oh, I see. Masayuki, you wanna play around a bit with me?"

*"Playing around a bit" with you will cost Masayuki's life.*

"Ahh, don't get so hasty. Masayuki is strong, but he mainly relies on his head during battle. If we really had to fight, I'd probably have the upper hand. That's why, you know, he won't be able to match up against the invincible Veldora!"

"I see! That's how I'd guessed anyway. As expected from Rimuru, you really get me. GA-HAHAHA!"

*Phew, this will do. It's all because you let it go straight to your head when anyone praises you.*

"So, what's your conclusion?"

*First, it's time to hear what Veldora has to say.* Having made up my mind, I turned to Veldora. He nodded with an "Umm" before continuing his speech.

"So, yeah, the Hero who managed to seal me didn't throw out any unnecessary attacks. By contrast, this woman called Hinata tried out a series of different attacks to see which ones would be effective against me. That being said, she was just as calm and cautious, but Hinata did heaps of unnecessary stuff."

According to Veldora, Hinata tried out a variety of attacks. She utilized all sorts of magic, spells, magic tools, and even magic artifacts. No expense was spared in their battle. Any purely physical attacks were ineffective against Veldora. That's why Hinata probably ran a number of tests to see which attacks had an impact. But in the end, none of Hinata's attacks amounted to much of anything.

"By the way, her last attack was pretty good. For just a moment, she managed to hurt me. It was something similar to the 'Absolute Severance' of the Hero."

What Veldora was praising was probably her 'Melt Slash.' I figured that it was likely Hinata's trump card. She even went so far as to sacrifice her moonlight rapier in order to execute this deadly attack. Yet, even so, she still couldn't hurt Veldora.

"Considering her fighting style, will she pose a threat?"

"Uh---it's certain that she's stronger than Clayman and the other poser demon lords. Even members of the Octagram may find themselves in danger, should they be careless. But Mentor is something else---"

"GAHAHA, of course! She'll need at least ten times more magicules to even stand a chance against me."

*I see...* Even Hinata was outmatched by Veldora.

*Aaah, how I would've loved to have seen that fight. It would've been useful for future reference, had it been recorded permanently. Never mind, it's too late for that now*. *Let the past rest, it's time to get back on track.*

"I get it. In other words, because of the whole ordeal with the Holy Knights and Hinata, all the floors below fifty-one are now out of commission? But hey, wouldn't the guardian have revived, nonetheless?"

"About that, wasn't Adalmann weaker than Gozer? He helps me out with research, and I think he's outstanding and all, but as the guardian of the sixtieth floor, he's not exactly dependable. Besides..."

At this point, Ramiris began to tremble---

"M-my masterpiece, the Elemental Colossus...was broken... It didn't revive!"

She broke down into tears as she finished.

*Wasn't it a guardian as well?*

"Did you forget to equip it with a bracelet or something?"

"N-no, it was the same when you destroyed it," Ramiris said in a huff. "For some reason, golems just won't revive..."

I heard that it was possible to revive naturally spawning golems, but the ones created by Ramiris would not. Hearing that made me think of something.

"Perhaps it had to do with the lack of a soul. After all, Beretta can be revived. Is it possible that the Elemental Colossus was considered to be an item?"

"---Eh?"

"Um, that's very likely. Ramiris, could the reason why your Skill did not apply be that the Colossus was outside its effect?"

Veldora added in agreement, so I was probably right. In other words, even if she were to make another one, there's still a chance that it would get broken again. The Elemental Colossus was strong though, so it was unlikely for it to get destroyed often. That said, we still needed to figure something out. But before that---

"It takes a long time to make that thing, doesn't it?"

"Yeah...that's why there's no guardian on Floor 70..."

Of course.

"Also, Zegion, on Floor 80, will need to sleep for a bit longer. Apito has grown stronger as well, but her combat experience is lacking. If she is planning to be a guardian, I think she will need more training."

According to Veldora, he seemed to have given Apito some combat training. *So, he's heading in that direction?* Although I personally had doubts concerning the matter, because Veldora seemed highly motivated, I'd let them have their way.

By the way, her instructor was Hinata. Apparently, using the rematch with Veldora as bait, he had asked Hinata to mentor Apito. Hinata was already tutoring the kids, she must've been willing to instruct Apito as well.

There was also Kumara. Floors 81 through 89 were guarded by Kumara's subordinates. Those majins were all generated using Kumara's tails, each of them possessed free will and could evolve and learn independently. Due to the release of all her subordinates, Kumara's own magicule content decreased drastically. She, alongside Chloe, Alice, and the others, would be studying under Hinata.

![break]

---As of yesterday, that's what had been decided.

"In other words, we have no real guardians from Floors 60 to 90 right now?"

"Yes!"

"Um, that's why we were troubled!"

For some reason, Ramiris and Veldora both looked rather smug.

"W-what..."

"The timing is just horrible."

Myourmiles and Masayuki were both shocked by the current state of affairs within the labyrinth. *And I thought that there was room for slacks*---looks like I was too naive once again.

"...I got the gist of things," I sighed, feeling rather powerless.

![soft scene break]

This was the perfect storm of bad news. But on the bright side, we were able to identify the issues of the floors below fifty-one. Moreover, all the traps I laid were still there. Our focus should be on the floors below forty-one, or rather, focus on floors below forty-nine.

"It's just a matter of time before the tempest serpent gets beaten. But we don't need to worry!"

"Oh oh, as expected from Rimuru. Have you already come up with a solution?"

"I see. We don't have to worry as long as you're around!"

Hearing my words, Veldora and Ramiris's distress seemed to have vanished.

I nodded to the two snobs and expressed my ideas, "Listen carefully now. As I've just said, I've put all the kick-ass traps below Floor 41. Those intruders will have a bad time."

"Oh oh...that sounds so reassuring."

"Ho---I see, I see."

"By the way, Rimuru, what kinds of traps did you plant there?"

*Hehe, you wanna know? I'll tell you then.*

"The ultimate trap I had prepared on Floor 49 is slime. After passing into certain hallways, there is a mechanism to isolate people. And that's when a bunch of slimes will appear. Those fellows are a pain in the ass to deal with."

A large amount of slime would gush forth and coalesce, forming a giant slime that was over three meters thick. The path forward, as well as backward, would be blocked, trapping the challengers like fish in a barrel. None of the physical attacks, neither slashing, beating, nor ramming would work on the slimes.

In a tightly sealed hallway, the magic at their disposal would be limited as well. Explosive spells were out of the question because they would probably just end up blowing themselves up.

Although individual slimes posed no threat, they would all slowly move in to attack. And considering that the challengers would be cornered, this started to shape up as a significant threat.

"GAHAHAHA! Now we definitely will win!"

"Uh-huh, it's our win for sure---!"

"You two are so naive. I've got many other tricks lined up as well."

It was too early to get excited about the concept of my traps alone. There were still a ton of other traps to go over. Hear all about them and shiver in fear!

![break]

-   Slime Pool: Although it appears to be a soft-feeling passage at first glance, it is actually a slime. About halfway through, it'll suddenly show its true colors.

-   Slime Rain: Fist-sized slimes rain down from above. They will also try to sneak into the openings in your clothes. Watch out for their acidic burn.

-   Slime Doll: At first glance it looks like a monster. But it won't get tired after sustaining consecutive attacks from its enemies. It will slowly exhaust the opponents' stamina. The more terrifying aspect of it, is that it will splatter strong acid on the enemies' weapons every time it is attacked. Watch out for your weapons' durability.

![break]

And so on and so forth.

There were other traps as well, but all of them were installed with the intent of staggering the enemies---especially the ones aimed at destroying challengers' weapons. *Surely, it would be difficult for them to continue fighting after that.*

At the very least it could help us buy some time.

"Amazing. Those traps sounded amazing. So, you were saying that we don't need to rely on the traps to take out the enemies directly, but instead only harming them slightly?"

"That's the idea, Veldora."

"I see. Without weapons, no matter how strong they are, they will probably be intimidated. That's when we can break them."

"Yeah. It's best to just defeat them straight away, but we can figure out something else if that doesn't work. Right now, we can at least get some more time."

It looked like this time my traps' only purpose was to stall for time. Although that was a bit disappointing, we can use the time we earned to think of a countermeasure.

"Then what will you do with the extra time you've got?"

Since Veldora asked, I decided to answer seriously.

"What we should not forget is that our labyrinth is different from the normal one. An advanced labyrinth should be strengthened by overcoming various problems, shouldn't it?"

"---UH!"

"Hmm, of course we should."

"Then we just need to improve until we can handle the challengers next time. First, we need to deal with Adalmann. I'll figure something out for him. I also want to change the environment on the boss floors, for which I'll need Ramiris's help."

"Okay!"

Adalmann was a cardinal, if I recalled correctly, his role was the archbishop. Strictly speaking, he was supposed to be the support type. It was a mistake to let him be the guardian alone, what we should've done was finding him a partner to act as the vanguard. Besides, I had some ideas of my own. I'd find Adalmann and Ramiris later.

![break]

Next was the guardian on floor seventy.

"Regarding the Elemental Colossus, we have no choice but to make a new one. Luckily, it just so happens that the perfect man for the job has returned."

I had prepared the materials and planned to rebuild it. But it would've been boring to make the same colossus as last time.

"The perfect man?" Ramiris asked with doubt in her voice, to which I nodded in return.

"Kaijin is back. That guy has a hand for spirit engineering; he would be happy to help. Moreover, the experiment that I've been running might also be of help, so I'll be handing over my research results. You can look forward to the new and improved version of the colossus."

"---Really? That's wonderful!"

Even though he won't be able to produce the outcome immediately, Kaijin would definitely prove to be a big help. Even in the event that we didn't have enough time to finish it this time, its completion would, nonetheless, be a threat to future challengers.

"And regarding Floors 80 and below---"

"I think the problems will resolve themselves with enough time. When Zegion awakes, none of the amateur challengers will be able to hurt him. There are also the dragons prepared by Milim, they will probably evolve after staying in the labyrinth for a while."

Kumara was still growing as well, so there was no need to panic.

One question remained: how much extra time could we salvage?

"Okay, our plan is settled. All we need to do now, is to buy ourselves time. We can't simply rely on my traps alone. There's one thing I want to try out, and I'll need Veldora and Ramiris's help for that."

"Of course." "I got it!" the two of them agreed happily.

I nodded and turned to Masayuki.

"Masayuki, you should resume your conquest. Your secondary objective is to break through Floors 41 and below, but right now you'd best try to collect a complete ogre-set."

"Indeed. With Masayuki-sama's conquest, it will serve as a tremendous boost to our labyrinth's publicity. We don't have to rush things."

"Then we should just allow the others to break through Floor 40 first."

"Yeah. On the contrary, you may as well stay away for the time being, lest you get caught up in our operation."

"You're up to something again, aren't you?"

Masayuki looked at me skeptically. That really hurt my feelings. It's as if I was always up to no good.

"Ahh, that's a secret. In any case, we will be taking measures accordingly from now on. You guys, Myourmiles and Masayuki, will help by just acting as you normally do."

"I understand."

"Got it, I'll tell everyone else later."

*This should do. Let's see just how long my traps can last.*

"Then that's about---"

"Ah, please hold on one moment, I have something to discuss with your Majesty..."

As I was about to dismiss the meeting, Myourmiles stepped in. It looked like he still had something on his mind.

"What is it?"

"The thing is---"

What Myourmiles had to say surprised me.

"Hinata-sama asked whether the prize for completing the labyrinth would be delivered or not..."

"Huh?"

I couldn't help but gasp. The prize she mentioned was the bait we set for the nobles. We claimed that prizes would be given to people that manage to break through every tenth floor.

*Did Hinata want those prizes? I mean, she did pull through the floors...*

"Even though she didn't conquer it on the official record, Hinata-sama said that 'Since we challenged it with just means, shouldn't you guys pay us?'..." Myourmiles said, sounding rather troubled.

*That may be the case, Hinata-san. But aren't we in a two-way street in this regard? We got to do test runs of the floors, and the Holy Knights got to do live-fire training. So why should we pay them?*

"Reject her."

"But is that really okay? Wouldn't she try to challenge the labyrinth seriously if we refuse her?"

"It's all right, we can threaten her in time that 'We will make it public news that you lost to the final boss of the labyrinth.'"

"GAHAHAHA! How could I ever lose!"

Umm, it was times like these that you could count on him.

Besides, if she seriously decided to challenge the labyrinth, we could use this for publicity.

"I-I understand. But, if possible, it is best that Rimuru-sama yourself rejects her in person---"

"Eh, but I don't want to."

*I don't want to be disliked, after all. She's gonna be petty and I would be frustrated as well. So, this type of job should be handled by the resolute and decisive Myourmiles-kun.*

"B-but I heard that terrible things happen when Hinata-sama feels offended..."

"I'll be counting on you then, Myourmiles-kun-!"

I interrupted Myourmiles and concluded our conversation.

*Sorry, I don't want to be the buzzkill. If possible, I'd like to be on good terms with beauties.*

Myourmiles already had a villainous look and nerves of steel. And since he always put profit above all else, surely, he would convincingly reject her. Given this to be the case, I must've been hallucinating when I heard the sad sigh of "Then I'll use my own money to make up for it..."

The discussion was concluded.

Leaving behind a now depressed Myourmiles, I left the venue.

![soft scene break]

I told Veldora and Ramiris when to meet up on another day. We had to get all the preparation work done before that, but there was something I wanted to deal with first.

Shion was already waiting outside the room, so I went to find Shuna with her. Shuna seemed to be overseeing the dinner preparations and was giving all sorts of orders. There were more and more people in the kitchen, and the place was bustling with all sorts of races. Shuna was indeed an outstanding instructor to have easily managed all these people.

Although I didn't want to call her for the matter I had at hand, we were racing against time, so I made this an exception.

"Shuna, could I borrow a moment of your time?"

"Ah, Rimuru-sama! Please let me know what you need."

Shuna happily came to me as I called out to her. At the same time, the kitchen was in an uproar. It was rare for me to show up in person, and everyone was happy to have me taste-test all sorts of dishes. Normally I'd give my opinion on every one of them, but today I had some urgent tasks at hand. *Sorry everyone, I'll eat them next time.*

"I happen to need Shuna at the moment. I'll come and have fun with you all next time."

"Please do come by!"

"We will be waiting for you."

"Our skills have all improved, you will definitely be impressed next time you visit!"

Hearing me say "Delicious" seemed to be the equivalent of giving them a five-star review. The folks were highly motivated. I looked forward to my next visit.

"Then, Gobichi, I'll leave the rest to you!"

"Yes, Shuna-sama! Please count on me!"

Gobichi was now the best chef whose skill could only be rivaled by Shuna. When she wasn't present, Gobichi would act as the executive chef. The kitchen was left in good hands.

"See you guys on another day."

![break]

After bidding the crowd of disappointed people farewell, we departed. We were headed towards Floor 60 of the labyrinth, the one guarded by Adalmann.

"Ah, thanks for the packed lunch, it was delicious."

"You are too kind, it's wonderful that you liked it."

I thanked her for the bento as we were moving to our destination. Shuna smiled happily.

"Rimuru-sama, please let me prepare lunch for you next time!" Shion volunteered herself. I thought for a moment before giving my answer.

"I suppose, since you've grown a bit now. Maybe you can try to make lunch with Shuna next time?"

I figured that Shion had become more reliable nowadays. But still, I wanted to put a safety measure on top of that. With Shuna, surely, Shion wouldn't be able to run wild.

"Then, Shuna-sama, let's make it tomorrow!"

"Hehe, all right, Shion. Let's start with the easy stuff first, please."

Shuna and Shion chatted joyfully. The two were wonderful together during the musical performance as well. They sure were close to each other.

![break]

As we chatted, we reached Floor 60.

"Excuse us, Adalmann."

"Oh oh, to have Rimuru-sama come here in person! I am most regretful of the event that transpired, I shall willingly accept whatever punishment you deemed befitting for me---"

As soon as I called, Adalmann rushed to me and dropped to his knees. Still dramatic as always, but at this point I had come to consider this the norm.

"No, it came down to our naive planning. It was too difficult for you to handle the Holy Knight Order alone as you are, your failure was understandable."

"---No, I can only lament my own inadequacies. My opponents were very experienced as well... Yet I resorted to my old tactics I used when I was still the wight king. I lost before I could cast even a single spell..."

At this time, Adalmann was just a wight without power. Even though he had a wealth of arcane knowledge and combat experience, his body was still in the state of a lesser monster. The magic he could use was limited, and he could only summon lesser undead. The monsters he summoned would evolve after absorbing the magicule in the labyrinth, but it took time to do so. It was going to take a while for Adalmann's subordinates to become powerful. What we needed to do now, was to make Adalmann stronger, and fast.

"It's more important that you now are aware of the extent of your strength. Since you've learned that now, I have a question for you, if you don't mind."

"Please, do ask."

"To what extent can you use 'Holy Magic'?"

'Holy Magic' was the power of faith. It didn't require you to concentrate the magicule in the air, nor was it bound by the amount of magicule you yourself possessed. Aside from requiring more preparation, as long as you possessed the knowledge and sufficient time to chant, you could cast grand spells at little cost to yourself.

However, the usage of 'Holy Magic' was limited to those who 'Have formed a pact with God.' The "God," in this sense, referred to people who could manipulate spiritrons,' the special particles that magicules consisted of^[The term "magicule" may invoke the idea of a molecule, however, it actually refers to an element.]. In this world, it was irrelevant whether a being became a "God" conceptually. Those who could interfere with spiritrons directly, could be considered a "God." For instance, within the religion of Luminism, Demon Lord Luminas was the "God."

Adalmann was a fanatic follower of Luminism. Even after becoming a monster, his faith was not shaken. That's why, even after becoming a wight king, he retained the ability to cast 'Disintegration.'

But as he lost faith in Luminas, he instead turned towards worshipping me as his God. Perhaps now that the 'pact with god' no longer applied, that must've been why he couldn't use 'Holy Magic' any longer.

"Yes, I have become incapable of using nearly all of my magic. As it stands, even the use of lesser magic spells escapes me."

*I see.* 'Holy Magic,' at the end of the day, was in the same vein as 'Spirit Magic.' It depended on a pact of some sort as the user borrowed strength from a being of higher power.

The same applied to Hinata. She couldn't have used any 'Holy Magic' if she hadn't borrowed the power from Luminas. In other words, if humans stopped relying on the Demon Lord that was known as a "God," they would also lose one of the effective means to combat monsters.

All in all, I felt that the more I knew about the matter, the scarier it got. This world might've become even more chaotic if Luminas suddenly decided to do something.

![break]

"Then I have a question for Shuna as well, to what extent can you use 'Holy Magic'? Also, who did you put your faith in?"

"For me, technically speaking, I use it differently from 'Holy Magic.' I only emulated it using my Unique Skill 'Analyst.' It worked surprisingly well."

*I see, so she imitated the magic.* In other words, after I told her to analyze the magic barriers, she turned out to have learned how to imitate a part of 'Holy Magic.' Moreover---

"And my faith lies in Rimuru-sama. I believe in his strength from the bottom of my heart. So, I thought that I would also be able to do it," Shuna said with an embarrassed smile.

"---Ah? So, during our battle, your claim that even monsters could use 'Holy Magic' was actually...?"

"It was a bluff. Even though I was confident, you were the one who actually proved it," Shuna said with the same smile.

Adalmann's jaw dropped to the ground---figuratively---as he heard those words. For a skeleton, this guy had some lively expressions. *Right, let's put that aside for now.*

The most important element in casting 'Holy Magic' was faith. It sounded like something similar to the soul connection ability. Shuna somehow mastered the essence of it. All she needed to do next, was to build upon and study the theories. I had a rough understanding of the matter, so it shouldn't be that hard.

"Then, I wish to bestow upon both of you 'The Ultimate Secret of Faith and Grace.' Luminas taught me this not long ago, and it's top secret. Please don't leak it."

Adalmann was already a high priest, if he were to connect with me, he would have been able to cast 'Holy Magic' again. Nowadays, his magicule had been reduced drastically, and with 'Holy Magic,' his strength could once again be greatly increased.

"'Ultimate Secret of Faith and Grace'---"

"OH, OHOHOH... I finally get to worship a real god..."

*This guy's still such a fanatic, but I'll tolerate him for now.*

"Uhh, Rimuru-sama, is it really okay for me to know this as well?"

I almost forgot I was in Shion's arms. I hadn't been hugged by her like this in a while---it went without saying that I was in my slime form. I felt a longing for this feeling, I wanted to stay in this state.

Shion wouldn't understand my explanation anyway, so I simply told her not to spread the news, "Just don't tell anyone else!"

"Of course!"

Hearing her reply so full of spirit, I was satisfied.

And so, I began to give a rough explanation.

"I see... In other words, if I put my faith in Rimuru-sama, I can also learn to use 'Holy Magic'?"

"Umm, I suppose you can. Although I hope that you can study it yourself in your spare time. You should also be Adalmann's consultant."

"I understand. I'm looking forward to it as well. I don't know how far I can take it by studying."

Shuna was quick to understand. With her Unique Skill 'Analyst,' she would learn 'Disintegration' in no time. On the other hand, Adalmann...

"WOW, OHOH, OHOHOHOH! THE POWER, THE POWER IS COMING OUT!"

He was beyond excited.

"HOLY CANNON!"

Adalmann shouted as he thrust one hand out before him. A bright red light began to illuminate the depths of his eye sockets. A concentrated magic missile burst forth from his skelepalm. This was the Holy Magic 'Holy Cannon.' It was invoked by the will of Adalmann, with a certain power.

"OHOH, GOD, MY GOD, RIMURU-SAMA---"

He fell to the ground and began to worship me.

*That's pretty spooky, please stop.*

"A-alrighty. Looks like it was a success? Let's keep up the good work. Go and learn some more advanced magic, and if there's a problem, just go ask Shuna!" I uttered in a hurry. Shuna understood and nodded lightly.

"---I see, you didn't want to deal with this guy, so you made me his consultant?"

*Since the person in question has heard it now as well, perhaps the right thing for me to do, is to pretend I didn't hear anything. I'm very dull, after all, no idea what you're talking about---yeah, that'll definitely drive her off.*

"Rimuru-sama, I will not betray your expectations---!" Adalmann proclaimed in high spirits. I then decided to ask him another important question, "By the way, didn't you hurt yourself by using Holy Magic, considering you're a wight?"

Holy Magic could be divided into two types: first, to manipulate spiritrons,' which had no elemental affinity, and second, to utilize the holy element to eliminate magicule.

Holy Cannon fell under the latter category, so I thought that it would have harmed an undead monster.

"Hahaha, it did hurt a bit, but it was nothing serious---"

*I see.* Adalmann's sturdy backbone let him tough it out. But that didn't really solve the issue. If he were to have Beretta's Unique Skill 'Reverser,' he could probably convert holy and demonic elements^[To clarify, the demonic element actually refers to magicule, because only monsters possess magicule (humans use mana), and the holy element is the counterpart to all monsters.]... That would have to depend on the outcome of future research.

In any case, he should switch up his ability for this occasion.

"Adalmann, can you manage this?"

I jumped out of Shion's arms and cast a ray of light in the air.

"OHOH!"

"I excluded all the holy elements and tried to elevate the power further. This is an original spell of mine, Holy Magic 'Holy Ray.'"

'Holy Ray' was a magic spell that didn't have any element affinity. If he were to switch to using this, as long as he cast it correctly, the caster shouldn't be affected. However, this move was pretty difficult to perform---it would mean that he had to put even more faith into me...

Even though this was magic designed to tackle single opponents, its power was greater than my 'Megiddo.' It could be fired in rapid succession at an almost blinding luminosity. So, it would appear to be like a flash of light, when, in reality, they were, in fact, small, rotating spiritrons.' It was an attack that pierced the enemy, making it less deadly than 'Disintegration,' in turn the time required for chanting was also reduced.

"Amazing, this magic is amazing!" Adalmann was overjoyed.

If he could master this spell, he should also be able to get used to manipulating spiritrons.' When that time came, he would be able to blast even thicker beams of light and greatly enhance their power.

This was one of the magic spells that I requested Raphael-sensei to develop. I figured that for Adalmann, as he was right now, it would be a perfect fit for him.

"Don't be shy, I'll be there to discuss anything about magic. Remember to contact me."

Shuna was ready to handle this task for me, to my relief.

"Then, please work hard to practice from now on and master the 'Holy Magic' that won't harm you."

I sure hoped that he would put in the extra effort every day, so that he wouldn't end up as a pile of bones after every fight---that was my rationale behind those words of encouragement.

![break]

Adalmann was dancing with glee, but I got him to calm down with a gesture, before moving on to the next problem.

"Next, as it stands, your means of attack are still few and far between. You can gradually increase them in the future, but before that, something needs to be done first."

"And that is?"

"Weren't you originally a rearguard?"

"If I had to put it in words, I suppose I mostly offered rear support for the army. When I was still a wight king, I used summoning magic to raise the undead army and win by sheer numbers."

I suspected as much. Since there were no such rules that limited the number of floor guardians to one, it was just a matter of finding him a vanguard, and fast.

"I see. So, it was a mistake to set you up against an entire team by yourself."

"I'm something of a martial artist myself, but, as a skeleton, it's not very effective..."

*That's hardly the problem.* This wasn't about his proficiency in hand-to-hand combat, though I think he mistook it as personal criticism.

"No no no, don't be so self-conscious now. It's fine when there's only one opponent, but when they come in a group, you have all the right to summon companions. Didn't you have a companion? His name was---"

"Oh oh, were you talking about my friend Albert?"

"Yes, yes, that Albert-kun. He seemed to have become a skeleton swordsman now. Wasn't he a Templar Knight in the past? His swordsmanship even put Hakurou up to a tough fight. That's beyond just strong. If we prepare proper equipment for him, he could serve as a force to be reckoned with, couldn't he?"

"He is an outstanding man, surely, he will be able to live up to Rimuru-sama's expectations."

Hearing Adalmann's proud declaration, I, too, became confident in the idea.

"If that's the case, please hand this gear to him later."

I took all sorts of equipment out of my 'Stomach' and laid them on the ground. I heard that Albert could fight without a shield. Then I'd present him with this sword and armor---

![break]

Cursed Sword---A bastard sword that absorbed life force from the surroundings and converted it into attack power. However, it also absorbed the life force of the user. It was a complete failure.

![break]

Cursed Mail---It maintained a magic barrier that greatly raised endurance and defense against magic. However, it was, once again, a failure that absorbed the life force of the user.

![break]

These were developed by both Kurobee and Garm in pursuit of raw strength. They were planning to make them into a series but discovered the flaw that no living beings could wield them.

By the time they finished them, Kurobee, and even Garm, were exhausted. Nowadays this has become a fun tale. Nevertheless, the works they made were filled with memories, and they couldn't just throw them away. Moreover, if you were to look at their quality alone, they were both special-grade gear...

Monsters were living beings as well, and just as we thought no one could use this gear, I realized that undead could handle them just fine.

"How about them? Do you feel any worse once putting them on?"

"We are already dead, so we don't really feel anything in particular."

I confirmed with Adalmann, and it seemed to work all right.

As soon as he unsheathed the sword, Shuna and Shion's expressions changed for the worse. This indicated that its 'Life Force Absorption' had been activated. And even so, Adalmann didn't seem to flinch. That should mean that undead monsters were good to go with this gear.

"Okay, looks like it worked just fine."

Adalmann sheathed the sword and, with that, 'Life Force Absorption' ended. Looks like even the act of unsheathing could be considered as an attack.

"There's also this."

It was a surcoat I made with 'Sticky Steel Thread.' It boasted impressive resistance to heat and cold as well as slashing attacks. Normally, this would've been sold in our nation's market as a specialty with an insanely high price.

"I will take this. Albert will be overjoyed as well!"

*That's great.* With Albert as the vanguard, Adalmann would have a lot more room to perform. *Oh, by the way, this reminds me.*

"By the way, Adalmann, take this," I said, taking out a jet-black clerical robe. It looked like a dark mage robe, handsome and luxurious.

This was the most expensive product produced in the Tempest Federation and would be sold for over a hundred gold coins. For comparison, that's the equivalent of a classy car. Even the royalty and noblemen from other nations would find it difficult to afford. It was super rare merchandise. Its level of quality went without saying. The cherry on top was its ability to 'Automatically Regenerate' after being torn. It was a rare piece of magic gear that was enchanted with special abilities.

"OH, OHOHOH..."

Adalmann took it from my hands with reverence.

"I'd hope you can wear this and show your prowess as a wight king facing the challengers. I think it's suited for a floor guardian and can create some atmosphere."

To be honest, it partially came down to just being a hobby of mine.

I asked for Ramiris's help to re-decorate the floor. We made it look like a throne room and Adalmann was to be the king leading the army of undead monsters.

"Just leave it to me. I'm good at it, after all."

Adalmann was quite competent.

"Then I'll be counting on you in the future. You can also find a few powerful knights to serve as your squires."

"Understood. Then, I hope to confirm something with you---"

"Umm, what is it?"

"Your Majesty, I wish to bring a pet of mine to this land, do I have your permission?"

*A pet? Umm---sure, I guess.*

"I see, I don't really mind. You can have your pet join in the fight if you want. But take care to not let your total number of companions exceed the number of challengers."

"Understood. The land entrusted to me by my god Rimuru-sama, I, Adalmann, shall defend it with every bone in my body!"

*There he goes, overreacting again.*

I was tired of dealing with this, so I decided to ignore him.

"Then, tonight we will re-decorate your floor in the style of a throne room. You can decide the recruitment of your subordinates. Should anything else come to mind, you can find Shuna and Ramiris to discuss it with."

"YES, MY LORD---!"

"Remember Rimuru-sama's words by heart and work hard!"

Shion, for whatever reason, concluded the conversation, leaving Shuna at a loss for words. But since Shion looked pretty self-satisfied, I didn't tease her about it.

![soft scene break]

Skipping forward to the next day, we gathered at the appointed time.

"Hehehe, Adalmann's floor has been remade to perfection!" Ramiris proudly reported as soon as she saw me.

Looked like she had finished preparing the throne room last night.

"Thanks. Now Adalmann can actually hold his ground."

"Is it really okay?"

"Um---at least he would perform better than yesterday, and the days before that. However, he may still have a hard time against rank A opponents, but he should be able to force his opponent into revealing all their cards."

If Adalmann were to be persistent in his pursuit, surely the enemies would be forced to show their true strength. If that were to be the case, it would be time for Raphael-san to shine. It would analyze the combat record and figure out a strategy for me.

All we needed to do was to apply said strategy on the next floor. Therefore, even if Adalmann lost, it wouldn't be an issue. However, depending on how well our next operation works out, not only Adalmann, even Gozer and Mezer may not have a chance to demonstrate their prowess.

It was better if we had multiple strategies.

And so, we had to put them into action immediately---

"What the heck have you all been doing! I've heard the news; did someone beat my dragons!"

Trouble had arrived. Milim burst into the meeting room as she roared in a furious tone. She was dragging Gobta along in one hand like a rag. Despite getting scraped across the floor, he was still breathing.

"Hehehe, I did it... I made it through!"

Gobta was babbling something incoherent, but he *did* seem to be conscious. He probably got whipped into shape pretty hard by Milim and was utterly exhausted.

In spite of this, he didn't look any stronger. Although, he *did* look like he'd been through hell, was he all right?

Ignoring my concern, Milim nodded heavily.

"Yeah. Gobta was great! I didn't expect him to survive hell mode," she praised Gobta with a satisfied look on her face.

For Milim, of all people, to be praising him, said a lot; surely, Gobta had achieved some goals.

"Then I shall teach you the 'Veldora-Style Killing Arts^TM^' as well---"

"NO WAY! Gobta is my disciple!"

Completely disregarding an exhausted Gobta laying on the ground, Veldora and Milim began to argue with one another.

*I'm not getting involved in this mess, let's see what fate had in store for Gobta. In any case, it's great that he has come back in one piece. I really need to reward him handsomely later.*

The best thing for him now was to get some good rest. Upon hearing my suggestion, Gobta immediately headed to the lounge for a nap.

Ranga also made it back.

"M-master, I have returned," Ranga said, evidently exhausted.

He stumbled as he slowly made his way over to me. Ranga's body was covered in scars just like Gobta. Their special training was clearly very intense. Ranga closed his eyes and was overjoyed while I pet his head absentmindedly.

![full page image](image5)

"You worked hard, now rest up in my shadow."

Before I could say another word, Ranga dove into my shadow.

![break]

Something off topic:

Later, once Gobta had recovered, I asked him how their training went, and he told me that it was mostly combat practice. Milim found monsters equal to or stronger than them to brawl with. Fight, repeat, and repeat some more.

After Gobta had mastered communicating with Ranga, they proceeded to fight Karion and Midley from dusk till dawn.

Milim had told Gobta: "No matter how hard you try, you can't increase the amount of magicule you have. But rest assured, you can work around this with your ability to unite with Ranga. It'll be your job to utilize this immense strength wisely later on! All you need to do is practice your skills, leave the task of increasing magicule to Ranga!"

"And after that, I have been receiving special training to practice my battle sense," Gobta said with a smile.

He also obtained Extra Skill 'Sage' which had the ability to accelerate his thought processing.

*This guy's going places.*

![soft scene break]

Well then, since Milim had come, that proved to make things significantly easier from here on out.

I had been busy making preparations after I bid Adalmann farewell last night. And, as it turned out, I managed to finish it on time.

I took out the items I had just completed. Veldora, Ramiris, Milim; all three of them were transfixed by the items in my hands, gazing at them with intrigue.

"Everyone, check this out! I have some special items here. I've been working on it for a while, and it's gonna be revolutionary. It'll help resolve all the problems in the labyrinth *and* introduce a whole new level of fun into our lives!"

As I finished, I handed each of them one of the items.

I didn't expect Milim to come today, but in truth, I was going to call her when this item was put to practice. So, it all worked out, I had already prepared one for Milim.

I was inspired by the homunculus used by Duke Elalude in the past.

Since we could replace our bodies temporarily, this opened the door for many fun opportunities.

"What is this?"

"I've never seen this before; can you eat it?"

"Hmm, in my opinion, this is something similar to a soul container."

The three expressed their views.

*Give up already, Ramiris, you can't eat this. Does she think that everything I prepare is food...? Oh well, never mind.*

![break]

Veldora's answer was the closest. It was indeed something made to emulate a soul container. The moment that you transferred your consciousness into the body of a homunculus, you would need to cast special magic techniques in order to establish a connection to the soul. I ran an 'Analyze and Assess' on the process and modified it myself. It was the same container I gave Treyni-san, the container for the 'Chaos Core.'

I officially named it Emulated Soul^[The ruby text was rather incomprehensible ギジコン (Gigicon), which is why we went with the kanji].

"Veldora got the closest answer. This is an emulation of a soul container. I can't exactly recreate something like a 'Soul,' so I decided to settle for the next best thing."

"Oh, so how did you make something like that?" Veldora seemed very pleased to learn that his answer was the closest and asked me rather smugly.

There was no need to hold back now, so I might as well just explain it. But before that, I'd be a little dramatic. After all, it took me a lot of time and effort to make these, surely, I could shock them a little bit.

"Hold your horses, I will explain in detail. But first, take a look at this. Hold this in your hand and picture your favorite monster before your eyes."

Apart from the 'Emulated Souls,' I took out some black orbs and put one in everyone's hands. Veldora tilted his head while gazing intently at the fist-sized object in his hand.

"Hmm? Anything I want?"

"Yeah. Any monster that exists. Even the crazy rare type."

"Like a goblin or an orc? Can I even have a one-horned rabbit or a man-eating bear?"

"Huh? Sure. But just remember to pick the ones you like. Don't complain about not liking it after you've decided."

"Hmm, monsters. Are we making monsters to defeat the labyrinth challengers...?"

"That's how it is."

They were as sharp as ever during times like these. Seemingly understanding my words, they began to draw the image in their minds.

![break]

The black orb was a Master Core^[The Kanji reads 'Magic Essence Core.']. In order to craft this, the magic core of Charybdis was instrumental. I isolated it in my 'Stomach' and had Raphael analyze it thoroughly. It was the 'Core' of a large monster and the source of its power.

Before I became a demon lord, all of its negative energy seemed to have been consumed. That's why, in that moment, it was merely an empty shell. It therefore became the perfect medium for securely containing a soul. And that was---

After some time, the magicule in the air gradually concentrated in the 'Master Cores' and created monsters. All of them were the ideal forms imagined by Veldora, Milim, and Ramiris.

"How about this, isn't it interesting? And just as Veldora said, let's take on the challengers using these monsters. That was the main reason why I gathered everyone here."

Although that wasn't the only reason, no one pursued the matter. The trio were deeply moved after seeing the monsters they created.

![break]

Ignoring the three of them, I also began to create my own monster. It was a floating soul that had a transparent body---a ghost.

If we don't consider the stats, it possessed the special ability 'Physical Nullification.' Since it was a ghost, you couldn't exactly hit it physically. And in turn, because it also didn't possess any physical means *to* attack, you could only use magic attacks yourself.

Next up, we have Veldora.

I saw a skeleton standing there, a skeleton warrior. He wouldn't be able to use magic, but perhaps it could learn how to use it in the future. Once it evolved to be a more advanced species, it could probably learn 'Qi Fighting' as well.

On the other hand, we have Milim.

Her creature had a damp, gooey body with no hands or feet, and its red color made it stand out---it was a slime.

*Hey*...

"Oi, why did you make a slime? Are you trying to make fun of me?"

"No way, it's because... You wanted me to think of a monster I like. Why are you complaining?!"

She turned the table against me instead. Never mind, since she seemed to be having fun. Her eyes were glowing as she shouted 'Slime!' I did want to ask why it was bright red.

Last but not least, Ramiris.

*A knight? Hold on, is it actually a set of armor?* It was animated armor. Even though it was a full plate set of armor, for some reason, it looked woefully shabby.

However, among the four monsters we created, hers was the largest. My guess was that Ramiris had an inferiority complex due to her small size. That's why she imagined a giant monster, to compensate. Yet at the end of the day, it was all looks and nothing behind it, very much Ramiris's style.

![break]

Everyone was gaping in awe at their monsters.

But there were more surprises in store for them.

"Listen now, folks. As Veldora has said, we are going to use these monsters to beat the labyrinth invaders."

"Hmm? Invaders---?"

"Indeed. These monsters are guardians of the labyrinth, after all. In that sense, wouldn't the people coming in be invaders?"

"I see, I see how it is."

"H-how, what is?"

"Hm-hm, Ramiris, we are going to stand at the front line with the labyrinth monsters. So, it would be inappropriate to still call them challengers."

"I get it, now that you've put it this way, it would indeed sound strange."

"Uh-huh, I thought as much."

Veldora explained in my stead to make Ramiris realize what I meant. Then there was also Milim who was pretending like she understood everything. I wasn't sure whether she grasped what was going, but I ought to continue the topic, nonetheless.

"Then, do you guys think it is possible to defeat the invaders using these monsters?"

"No way, they're too weak."

"The armor I created looks really cool, but there's no way they can make it."

"Rimuru, I'm so disappointed in you. I've seen this coming a mile away, these monsters are an insult to my expectations."

Hehehe, as I suspected, they started talking trash without a second thought.

*By the way, Ramiris and Milim, why are you guys acting all smug. It's kinda pissing me off. But since I'm the bigger slime, I shall tolerate it for now.*

"That's not all, just yet. What comes next is the real deal. Go take a seat and get comfortable. Then aim your Emulated Soul at your monster and shout 'Possess.'"

I saw a fair amount of skepticism in their faces, yet they still listened and sat down in a comfortable position. The chairs in the conference room were all very cozy and had exquisite cushioning.

All at once, they shouted: " " "POSSESS!" " "

I shouted along with them, and not a moment later, the Emulated Soul in our hands began to glow and was absorbed by the monsters. It then began to merge with the Master Core.

The possession of the Master Core was complete.

And at the same time---my consciousness faded. And soon after, the view in front of me changed. The effective range of my usual 'Magic Perception' decreased sharply, making me feel that my field of view had suddenly become much smaller.

By now I had simulated the five senses, so it felt much better than when I first reincarnated. However, unlike me, the other three had not experienced something like this in the past. I figured that they were going to have a hard time. With that in mind, I glanced around...

From my reduced field of vision, I could see a skeleton warrior stretching and a slime moving at abnormal speeds. There was also a set of armor going through rigid motions, looking like some shoddy, bootleg Tin Man.

All three of them sporting their new appearances, each had successfully 'possessed' the monsters they created.

![full page image](image6)

Hmm, I could feel myself settling in. It felt more natural than I expected, as if I were just controlling my own body. But my abilities were greatly curbed, so moving around wasn't really smooth. Then again, once I got to know the ghost's movement, it became very easy to react to things. And soon enough I got to move as I pleased.

It seemed to be no different for the other three.

" " "THIS IS AWESOME!" " " the trio shouted in sync, after spending some time to confirm the conditions of their new bodies.

"Right? How do you like the result of my research?"

"It's amazing, truly amazing, Rimuru!"

"Rimuru, is awesome! I knew you weren't a simple guy!"

"I was right, after all. I knew I was right to place my confidence in you!"

*These guys change their tune on a dime. But seeing how happy they look, it's truly great.*

"Um, looks like it was a success. What should we do now that we are transferred to these monsters... Don't need to spell it out for you guys now, do I?"

"Kukuku, what a silly question. You didn't want to leave it up to the monsters and hoped that we would duke it out ourselves. What an interesting idea you have, Rimuru."

"Indeed. I'm super pumped to start my own conquest of the labyrinth in this form, though..."

"I know. I get it now; this is a game!"

"What? Is this true, Veldora?"

"Mentor! Then can we defeat enemies with this body? And perhaps make this body evolve as well...?"

As expected from Veldora. He saw right through me. Yep, I was imitating an MMORPG, a Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. Although, this wasn't exactly on a large scale, so I suppose it wasn't really an MMO, but more like an MO?

Never mind, that's not important.

The important thing was that we wanted to have some fun in the labyrinth that we went through all the effort to build. That's the whole point.

"Hehehe, you sure know your stuff, Veldora. You saw right through me so easily. But don't get the wrong idea. I did develop this in order to enjoy playing this game, but don't we have other things to take care of before that?"

"GAHAHAHA, are you talking about that thing? So, are we supposed to use these bodies to take care of the challenger problem---no, to defend against the invaders?"

*Looks like he got what I meant.*

Indeed, I planned to use the monster body---monster avatar---to sabotage the rapidly progressing team Green Rebellion.

Just like what Ramiris said before, I was considering different ways we could have fun, like leveling up the bodies and learning how to fight with these inconvenient bodies that had many limitations compared to our original ones.

My true intention was for us to be able to get some fun out of defeating monsters and challengers. I never thought it would come in handy in this way.

"However, once we've done enough preparations, I plan to use it purely to experience the fun of challenging the labyrinth."

"I see, that way we can also try out our own labyrinth, right?"

"That's exactly what I meant. Moreover, we can't really show our true strength using this monster avatar. That means we can alter our perspective and see what problems the labyrinth has."

"Umm, you're right. After all, if I were to confront the challengers in the field, my authority as the king of the labyrinth would come into question. If I were, however, to possess some fragile monster..."

"Yes! No longer as a 'Demon Lord' or True Dragon, but as a monster that can unabashedly fight the invaders in the open."

"I get it, that sounds like fun!" Milim chimed in, fully on board.

Switching to a new, inconvenient body with all of its limitations probably felt fresh and exciting to her, seeing as she normally did as she pleased while flaunting her power. She seemed thrilled and intrigued by the concept.

"Then let's get to it."

"Umm, before we start the game properly, let's clear out the trash and make the place pretty again."

"Time to show my moves off. I've been itching to test out my forty-eight ultra-instinct kill moves!"

"Although I'm not feeling myself in this, I'm still tempted to try things out!"

![break]

We set off, filled with motivation. Now it was up to us to take care of the troublesome team Green Rebellion and make them no longer capable of challenging the lower floors.

In order to achieve this goal---I had come up with an even more devious plan.

![soft scene break]

Our first order of business was to get familiar with our monster avatars. The second important step was gearing up.

We were equipped with 'Revival Bracelets' that suffered from no usage limits, allowing us to resurrect, no matter how many times we died in a row. But that alone would not be enough, as our monster avatars were just recently created and were still low-tier monsters. Right now, we were nothing more than a couple of chumps, and no matter what we did, we could not harm members of Green Rebellion.

However, if we were to somehow become equipped with some high-grade gear...

"Next up, it's important for us to get armed. Let's go find Kurobee and ask him to make us some weapons and armor!"

"Oh oh, I see! If we were to continue as we are, right now, I'd be nothing more than a rickety skeleton."

"Fufu, you fools! My body is a slime, the agile extraordinaire! I'm goo-d to go with what I got!"

"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but if I'm a set of armor... Can I still wear armor?"

"Who knows? Perhaps you can make it work? Let's take a look first. Milim doesn't need any weapons, so please stay and keep watch."

"W-what kind of nonsense! Of course, I *could* stick with what I have now, but I still want to gear up!"

*How stubborn, why didn't you just say that from the start.*

Naturally, I wanted some gear too. So, I temporarily broke out of 'Possession' and prepared to head out.

"If you want to get back to your original form, just utter 'Exit' and you'll be able to return to your bodies."

I demonstrated the exit method to them and taught them how to store their Avatar Core^[These are the result of combining the Master Core with an Emulated Soul.].

The Avatar Core would only record monsters created at a prior point in time. One core corresponded to one monster, and you could not change its owner. This item represented everyone's core, so I reminded them to take good care of it. Thus, I gave further clarification, "With this, you can also call upon your avatar whenever you want."

"This is amazing. But when we do use 'Possession,' we should think about where to place our original body."

Veldora and Ramiris had reverted to their original forms and stood up from their seats.

"To make sure we don't lose it, how about we seal it in the bracelet?"

"That's right, I was gonna do that as well!"

She began to stroke the orb---Avatar Core---happily.

I'd have someone work on the bracelet as well. By the way, what was Milim doing?

"Oi, Mili---"

"I'm going in this form!"

Without letting me finish, Milim, still in her slime form, jumped into my arms.

"Let's go!" she protested, fully prepared to ignore everyone's words, and had the scene under her control.

It looked like she really adored the avatar.

*That's kind of childish... But, welp, she's a kid, after all.* You can't reason with kids about how childish they are. I decided to give up and began to walk away.

![break]

We arrived at Kurobee's workshop.

"Are you there, Kurobee?"

"Oh oh, is it Rimuru-sama? What can I do for you today?"

As soon as I called, Kurobee came out to welcome us.

Seeing that Veldora and Ramiris were with me too, he looked quite surprised.

"Umm," I said as we walked into the workshop, "I wanted to take some weapons."

It had been a while since I was last there, the number of people in the workshop had increased---including monsters. And it was still as hot as ever. I wasn't affected by temperature though, so it didn't matter to me. But it looked like working here was quite the hardship.

"Looks like you've gotten more disciples."

"Yes, thanks to your Majesty. Although they still have a long way to go, there are still many talented individuals among our ranks."

We toured around the workshop as we chatted.

The disciples looked up at the sound of my voice and, seeing me, stood up in unison and saluted.

I was somewhat taken aback, but Kurobee had gotten used to it at this point.

"Don't stop! Get back to work," he bellowed and forced the disciples to carry on.

However, I could relate to how they felt. It was like when a top executive went to visit the average joe's workplace. People would get nervous. Moreover, the lower on the chain of command, the more nervous the staff would feel.

Although the example doesn't entirely line up with the situation at hand, in this nation, I was the king. I didn't really pay attention to such things in the past, but now it was probably better for me to send someone in advance to inform them about such a visit.

Surely, it would concern people if I were to just drop by at random like this. In the company of my original world, if someone such as a general manager were to come around and visit, we would launch an office clean-up the day before and make preparations etc. If the person visiting were to be the director of the company, we would have prepared the office in a way that gave the impression that no failure was tolerated.

The higher the status the visitor was, the more casual they tended to behave, which in turn made us at the bottom put too much thought into preparations.

With that being said... I sincerely hoped they wouldn't prepare something dramatic every time just because of me. It also made me feel bad to suddenly call Kurobee while he was busy, so next time I'd be sure to come during off-hours.

"Sorry to barge in on you," I announced to the room, "I won't be dropping in this sporadically in the future, no need to be so nervous."

It may cause a problem if they acted too familiar with me, but there wasn't a need to be nervous about it. I liked to act cool, but I had no taste for embarrassing people. If they became too nervous, they wouldn't know how to react, which would also be troubling to me. I preferred an idiot-like response from someone like Gobta.

TPO---time, place and occasion when reacting to things---I hoped they would understand this.

The disciples were calmed by my words.

Confirming that, I nodded and entered the back room.

![break]

---As a side note...

There was something I didn't know at the time. Those disciples were not just nervous because I was their demon lord.

Without my notice, Tempest held a popularity contest. I was voted as one of the top three idols. They were me, Shuna and Shion.

I heard that my popularity seemed to have been extraordinarily high. In addition, Ramiris and Milim were candidates as well. I don't dare to say the ranking, but I heard that Milim and I smashed the top of the charts.

Seriously, should I sigh or feel joy about their growth? I was dumbfounded after being informed of what they were doing behind my back.

![soft scene break]

"Which types of gear do you need?" as we entered Kurobee's private quarters, he cut to the chase.

"About that---"

Since he asked what we wanted, we each began to list all the items we had in mind.

"I want to ask Garm to craft some armor for us. It should be fun for you two to work together again."

"You have a point. I was going to check on Garm anyway."

With that said, we accompanied Kurobee on his way to Garm's workshop.

![break]

We stirred up a commotion once more, but I played dumb this time.

"Gear for monsters? Ahh, master's still got all the interesting ideas as always."

Garm was rather shocked as we each 'Possessed' our avatars in front of him.

"I understand. Then I shall do as you asked, actually, let me prepare something even better!"

"Just count on me. I'm getting the creative itch as well. I'm going to create *the* ultra-strong gear that no human can hope to wield!"

Kurobee and Garm got on with their craft immediately.

*I'm looking forward to it*---I thought to myself and left with the folks.

![break]

It was gonna take days for the crafting to be completed. We spent this time getting used to the avatars, and thus we began our training.

We did things like fighting monsters on the upper floors or attacking newcomers who seemed like actual adventurers. During these few days, we began to assign roles and were getting pretty good at it. But before we had reached that level of teamwork, we took plenty of beatings.

We were even losing to beginner teams on the upper floors. There were times when we were taken out by our own traps set in the labyrinth. Those were some awkward moments. That did really piss me off though, leading to the development of magic items that would prevent the labyrinth traps from getting triggered by us. However, the times we did fall to these traps would remain as fond memories.

Ramiris fell into a trap, getting Veldora tangled up in it as well. I floated into the air while Milim got pushed against the ceiling. Since I didn't have to worry about getting caught in traps, I had gotten careless and forgot to alert them. It was a huge misstep, but, speaking of which, Ramiris... *How did you end up falling into a trap?* I could feel everyone relentlessly teasing her about it.

And so, as we endured, we trained all day and night without even catching a wink of sleep.

In combat, the most important thing was coordination. Under normal circumstances, we would've been able to call out to each other or give signals with a glance. However, we didn't have neat tricks like that. Mostly because Veldora and Milim were both tryhards.

However, I did have a Skill that was basically like cheating. I could use 'Telepathy Net' to contact everyone and deliver them precise commands. With myself as the command post, Veldora, Milim, and Ramiris were my foot soldiers. And in that way, we drastically increased our strength and raised our standards.

Once we could move with a certain level of confidence, we began to review our teamwork. Days passed as we waited for the equipment to be finished.

![break]

It was then that we were informed about Green Rebellion managing to break through Floor 49.

"This is bad. Those people finally beat the tempest serpent."

"Their combat style is extremely meticulous. Their first group of combatants would collect intelligence, followed by the rest of the teams focusing on draining the enemy's stamina, and finally beating the guardian using their main force."

Even if a guardian were to be defeated, they would be revived at full health shortly thereafter. However, in the case that a guardian won, the scars and tiredness accrued would remain. If it were to continue to fight, the circumstances would clearly be in the favor of the challengers.

"That was our miscalculation. We should've provided more ways for the guardians to heal themselves."

"But all those monsters rely on instincts to survive," Veldora commented. His rationale was that those monsters weren't intelligent enough to use healing items.

That was correct, but perhaps there was still a way.

"Should we perhaps ask Treyni-san for help? Being the labyrinth managers, surely, they would be able to heal the monsters?"

"Ah, I see. I should go ask her for help!"

And that was how Treyni-san's sisters became part of the aid team to heal the monsters when they were wrapped up in continuous fights.

Thus, one by one, we managed to address all the issues.

![break]

Next---

"Those people are approaching Floor 49 fast, what do we do, Rimuru?" Milim asked anxiously.

Like she said, Green Rebellion was about to enter the final battle ground with us.

"Our coordination should be sufficient despite our lack of equipment. Shall we attack them straight away?"

"I agree! It's finally time for me to shine. I'm gonna beat the devil out of those folks!"

Veldora and Ramiris were pumped.

To be honest, even if we were to fight seriously, our chances of winning weren't that high. I put my strongest traps on Floor 49, so that was the only location where we could pull back team Green Rebellion.

"This can't be helped, huh? We should at least wear some emergency gear---"

Anyway, even if we were wearing top gear crafted by Kurobee and Garm, we wouldn't be able to face our enemies head-on. Although it would greatly increase the chances of our victory, so we might as well give it a try.

Upon thinking so, I was about to decide when---

*Knock knock.*

The sound of someone knocking on the door rang in the meeting room.

"Rimuru-sama, Kurobee wanted to tell you that 'He's ready,'" Shion notified me.

Hearing the news, we looked at each other with grins on our faces.

![break]

The gear specially crafted for our monster avatars had been completed.

My gear were the Grim Reaper's scythe and robes of hell. A ghost could wear equipment as well, it was a specific property of magical gear.

Veldora's got the Grim Reaper's bastard sword and full body armor of hell. His left hand was equipped with the great shield of hell's gate. He was fully geared up.

As for Milim who was playing a slime, she could only be equipped with simple things. She first swallowed the Grim Reaper's javelin and wore a crimson feathered cape. She immediately gained a pair of red wings after equipping it.

*That's some incredible change.*

"The gear has to be equipped or it won't activate the effect!" Milim said with glee.

Since she was happy, I had no room to say anything.

Ramiris was next. She asked for heavy full body armor from Kurobee. The armor itself was finely crafted, the problem was whether or not she could wear it. Ramiris anxiously transferred herself to her avatar and tried to put on the armor. At that moment, lo and behold, the armor had been swapped out. With a loud 'Clang,' the rubbish armor fell to the ground and turned into dust before being blown away by the wind.

Ramiris's animated armor became heavy animated armor. This was not an evolution, and it also didn't seem to be a change in equipment. Instead, the pieces of armor themselves swapped their places.

"Eh, I move so swiftly now!"

Just as Ramiris said, before this her movement was very unnatural, like she needed to be lubricated. Now her movement looked very smooth. This would, surely, make coordination much smoother with her.

I never expected the quality of the armor to have an effect on movement. What an unexpected discovery.

Seeing how happy Ramiris looked, I asked her to choose her weapons and shield.

"Pooh! Stuff like shields are unnecessary for me!" saying that, she chose a large two-handed weapon, the Grim Reaper's great axe.

Its sheer might makes it a top-notch weapon, though wielding it may prove difficult. But never mind that, this would do. She always got mocked for being weak, so she probably got a little carried away this time. Interestingly, it reflected her personality as well.

![break]

And so, everyone changed to their new equipment.

This equipment fell under unique-grade. Since they were adjusted to be equipped by monsters, their designs, however, were rather unbalanced and comical in nature. Still, for any amateur adventurers, this was incredibly strong gear. We also applied some sort of a curse to register their users, so that they couldn't be stolen. To us right now, these were the best gear out there.

This new switch restored our resolve. Before we embarked on our battle, our spirits were soaring.

![break]

We checked the status of our avatars.

My ghost had given up physical attacks and focused on magic and mental attacks. It served the role of a sorcerer. I hoped to learn about 'Spirit Magic' and 'Illusion Magic' soon, since my goal was to become a wizard. Aside from that, I also wanted to learn 'Holy Magic.' What would happen if I placed my faith in myself? That was kind of part of my experiment.

Veldora's skeleton swordsman was a Jack of all trades, he could do anything. He served the role of a heavy warrior, but seemed to want to learn magic and become a magic knight.

Milim's slime, on the other hand, specialized in speed and one-shot-kills. She's the super buffed type. Or perhaps I should call her the romantic type?^[TL note: I believe Romantic Type (浪漫型) here has a similar meaning to phrase like 'メカは男の浪漫' (Robots are men's romance), it is just an otaku thing to say when you really enjoy/are attracted to certain archetype or genre.] It was her job to be the assassin. She may have been able to learn a thing or two from Souei, but I had forbidden her from troubling others when she was just fooling around.

Her approach was to launch an ambush by dropping from the ceiling for quick takedowns. If the enemies fell for it, she'd look like a boss. But what would she do if the enemies saw through such a setup? Well, I think she would run away, considering her high mobility. In some ways, slime was the perfect form for this.

Ramiris's heavy animated armor focused on strong attacks. It possessed some level of defense and even had the potential to be quite balanced. She fit the role of berserker. Not that she had really gone berserk, but it seemed that she has never considered her defensive capabilities. That was just how I had been calling her since she decided to become a dangerous monster bent on attacking. Once she had gotten familiarized with her abilities, I wanted her to team up with Veldora and play the role of shield for him.

![soft scene break]

Everything was prepared.

We wouldn't get hungry, so our ability to fight on end would really shine.

*Let's fire up our spirits and try our best in stopping the Green Rebellion.*

With a burning spirit, we stepped onto the battlefield. Yet it turned out---to our great disappointment, we crushed the Green Rebellion with ease...

*Gotta stay calm, yep, I gotta stay calm.*

As I *calmly* ran 'Analyze and Assess' on my avatar, I realized its power was almost at rank A. This was mostly thanks to my gear, but it's pretty much the case when I was able to use my power smoothly.

However, we miscalculated one thing. The abilities of our original selves would be reflected in the avatars. Even though we couldn't use all of our Skills, with 'Thought Communication' and 'Thought Acceleration' alone, these were enough to turn the favor to our side.

For me personally, I could cast magic so fast it was almost cheating. Bound by my mana pool, I could not use all the magic, but my vast arcane knowledge remained. Compared to a third-rate court mage, my magic was still leagues ahead. I didn't need to chant my spells and could cast consecutively without delay. Surely our enemy couldn't handle that.

As for Veldora, I almost suspected that he had a pair of eyes in the back of his head. He swung his sword like a master of swordsmanship.

"GAHAHAHA! My 'Veldora-Style Killing Arts^TM^' incorporates countless sword techniques. Hold on, that's not how it goes---" and on he went with his nonsense.

Veldora seemed to have learned some techniques from the manga he read. And I thought that mangas were just making up the drawings, looks like there were actually practical techniques out there as well.

Veldora was pretty unpredictable to begin with, so nothing could really surprise me at this point. Looking at him closely enough, you would realize he was acting like a moron.

On the other hand, we had Milim. She wasn't lying when she said that she focused on speed. She zipped around at break-neck speeds. It was beyond what the average person could control, let alone replicate, yet with Milim's reflexes, it was a piece of cake. Actually, I should say that that's just how fast a slime could move when it got serious. She could ignore friction while sliding across the ground and closed in on the enemies with a bounce. The way she darted along the ceiling with the same speed, surely, made it close to impossible for your everyday adventurer to spot her clearly.

I was a slime as well, yet I'd never realized such a thing until now. I was profoundly shocked.

"WAHAHAHA! You are so slow, all so slow. Eat this, you dimwit!"

Milim snuck behind her enemy without making a sound, acting all smug about it, and impaled the enemy's neck with her Grim Reaper's javelin---most fights with her ended like that.

Physical attacks couldn't easily harm her, and in order to cast magic against her, you would first need to get a clear fix on her. Now that I thought about this, it was pretty terrifying to fight Milim's slime as your opponent.

The person to complement Veldora and Milim was Ramiris, the 'Professional Wingman.'

"WHOOOA! LET ME SHOW YOU HOW STRONG I AM!"

She led the charge as soon as we saw enemies. In addition, Ramiris's combat style was to fight people head-on. Under normal circumstances, this was a risky move that rarely acted in her favor. She's such an idiot. But for the rest of us, her doing so was the right tactic. After reminding her several times to no avail, we turned this in our favor. In short, we used Ramiris as bait while we launched a three-pronged attack.

Normally, it would've been tricky to pull this off. But Ramiris set loose on a blind rampage, utterly disregarding defense. All the enemies saw was a large set of armor wielding the Grim Reaper's great axe barreling towards them. By then, confronting it was inevitable.

Because she completely neglected defense, all of their attacks were focused on Ramiris. However, she had 'Pain Nullification,' that's why she didn't even flinch and launched attacks one after another.

In addition, the armor itself was very sturdy. Sparing no cost and paying no mind to weight, the heavy animated armor was crafted out of thick sheets of magisteel. That imbued it with some level of 'Self Reconstruction,' so a couple scratches were nothing to worry about. The sheer weight of the armor was enough to crush the average person, and imagining such a giant hunk of metal charging at you---the threat it posed to our enemies was readily apparent.

Oh, and then there was my healing magic. As part of my experiment, I tried to cast 'Holy Magic' and found that I easily managed to pull it off, much to my surprise. As opposed to believing in myself, I controlled the spiritrons that I originally could not manipulate through the use of prayers.

This time, with me turned into a ghost, both the mana of my body and the words of my prayer would reach my original body. I then cast the magic borrowing the power of my original body. The purpose of prayer seemed to be to convey the will to execute the action.

When manipulating spiritrons,' you needed to listen to the individual wish of the prayer to execute them accordingly---with such a complex action, no matter how advanced my processing power was, I wouldn't be able to do it. That's why I turned to a different method and had different individuals conduct the calculation.

As the number of people who prayed---my believers---increased, my mana rose in kind. In other words, I could improve my "godliness."

In addition, because I was connected to my believers, it also served as a secret technique. I could use the minds of my own believers to expand my processing power. This would also allow me to lend them mana and processing power.

*I see how it is now.* That's why Luminas wanted to expand the number of followers she had. With a large number of followers, she could instantly cast large-scale magic.

'Ultimate Secret of Faith and Grace'---I had learned a terrifying Skill.

Let's drop that for now.

Considering this, I could now cast 'Holy Magic.' As a result, our team was extremely strong. And now, on Floor 49 filled with vicious intentions, we eliminated every member of the Green Rebellion.

We shouldn't be afraid to face anything; we should embrace challenges. Had we attacked head-on, we would have been defeated long ago. But rather, we honed our coordination and utilized traps.

We ordered the slime dolls to damage our enemies' weapons.

We used slime rain to distract them and cause them to waste their stamina.

We took the chance to ambush them and backed them into the slime pool.

Ramiris roared to attract the enemies' attention when Milim launched her sneak attack to completely disrupt the enemy's formation. Veldora focused on cutting them off and isolating the rearguard. We used the giant slime to defeat the weaker mages and thieves and had Veldora and Ramiris force the rest of their main combat force into the slime pool.

The goal was to destroy their gear with strong acid. Damaging the main force of Green Rebellion was to slow down their progress. That was our goal in this fight.

"Annoying! All our hard work---ruined!"

The pathetic cry made me realize that the captain of Green Rebellion was a woman. That surprised me a bit, but what she said next caught my attention even more so.

"Let's retreat while we've still made some gains. This is probably a good point to stop."

"You're right, 'home nation' has given the order anyway."

She talked to a surviving male member of the team that seemed to be her subordinate. She did just say that "the home nation has given the order." I heard that the mercenary group Green Rebellion didn't belong to any nation; they were free-lancers. I heard that their benefactor was the Kingdom of Ingracia, could it be that their entire group was hired? The way she said "home nation gave the order" sounded as though their loyalty towards it was more than a mere customer.

*Looks like I need to be mindful of it.*

Since the dungeon would attract customers, it was gonna attract many people with unchecked backgrounds. Regarding that, I'd been mentally prepared for it from the start, but it seemed that I needed to remind everyone about that once again. The Green Rebellion incident made me realize this once more. Moreover---

"This is wonderful."

"Right, we won!"

"That goes without saying, we are the invincible team!"

*These idiots need to be reminded or they'll soon get carried away with their immediate victory.*

That being said, right now even I was basking in the joy of completing our mission.
