# Interlude: The Demon Lords

Demon Lord Clayman holds his glass of wine in one hand and awaits the arrival of that moment quietly.

Tonight is the night of Walpurgis Banquet.

He looks both happy and irritated while analyzing several intel in his mind.

First, the bad news.

He has ignored his friend Laplace's advice and ordered the attack on Beast Kingdom Eurazania. But it turned out there wasn't a single citizen there, and it was a waste of his time.

He went on a raging storm after receiving a report from the commanding officer Yamza. But he can't give out order hastily without knowing the circumstances. That's why Clayman temporarily assembled the army to conduct a thorough search within the area.

As a result, they discovered a group of escapees.

Upon receiving the report, Clayman decided to order a pursuit without even thinking and dispatched reconnaissance around the area to spot out the hidden survivors.

And as it turned out, several hundred residents were hiding in the area, Clayman thus ordered his generals to take care of all of them.

However, the survivors went on escape as soon as the order is delivered.

Clayman was also bewildered by this and ordered an investigation out of confusion. That was the moment he discovered that there were thousands of refugees around the area that has gathered and escaped to the Jura Forests.

The hidden survivors were distractions to facilitate the escape of the main population.

*Cheeky bastards!*

Until that point did Clayman realize why the residents of the Beast Kingdom were nowhere to be seen. They have already mass migrated to seek refugee from Rimuru.

And those escapees have noticed the movements of Clayman's army. Thus they've released baits to help the rest to escape---This is how Clayman analyzes the situation.

His plan to hunt down some souls before the Walpurgis Banquet has now failed. This unforeseen occurrence greatly displeases Clayman.

"Yamza, the Banquet is starting soon. Before I return, move out all of our force. Do not let anyone escape. Kill them all and bring me the survivors."

"Your wish is my command!"

Clayman nods in responding to his subordinate. It has become an unarguable fact that it is too late for him to awake.

Clayman ends the magical communication; having much anger still remained in his heart.

But on the other hand, there are also good news.

Clayman can collect intelligence through the landscape---electric signal and earth magnetism. No one knows about his talents, which is why Clayman was able to obtain immense amount of information.

This is the origin of Clayman's title "Marionette Master".

When he first obtained this skill, he could only interfere with individuals within his line of sights. Nowadays, this power has grown because of Clayman's continuous efforts developing it and has become the trump card that backs him up.

The power, namely the Unique Skill 'Manipulator'--- allows him to transform intel into coded transmission so as to monitor within a large radius. He is able to dispatch and monitor his subordinates, thus gain intelligence through their points of view.

He gained the intelligence regarding the revival of "Storm Dragon" Veldora through it.

It wasn't anything of interest to him, by chance he overheard some conversations worth investigating made by the group of humans who appeared to have been kept alive even after communicating with the storm dragon. The information Clayman got through eavesdropping the men dressed like adventurers who were leaving the monster town turns out to be a huge surprise to him.

This was how it went.

The self-proclaimed leader of the Jura Forest Rimuru in fact, did not eliminate the Farmus army. That was due to the revival of Storm dragon which led to the disappearance of that entire army even to this day. And it is rumored that the dragon has lost more than half of its magicule after its recent revival.

That would prove why the vast Jura forest has not shown much magical reaction and why the adventurers were lucky enough to survive to retell these stories and reveal the fact to Clayman. If the "Storm Dragon" Veldora has been revived, Clayman, a demon lord, could not have missed it out. It is most likely true as the rumor goes the battle against the Farmus army has likely depleted most of his power.

These two pieces of intelligence gave Clayman headache.

*Why not we go wage war against the evil dragon now and defeat it at ease. On top of that, it may probably even be of use to me---*

Yes, Clayman has ambition as well.

It would seem that the evil dragon has made its base at the town built by the monsters, which would make intelligence gathering harder around the area, but... He thinks it's nothing to be rushed as of the moment. That evil dragon won't be able to restore its strength in two or three days, so he can take care of it after the Walpurgis Banquet.

*If the situation remains against our favor, I'll just send Milim to deal with it. Compared to that, I should---*

Upon thinking so, Clayman decides to focus on dealing with the Banquet.

Perhaps he shouldn't have put that much faith in Milim's power---

Clayman must have realized as well, that there are many suspicious points.

The enemy has suffered no casualty by now and it doesn't make much sense. Besides, the survivors who are supposed to be scattered all over the region are now gathering up.

This intelligence are too important for the cautious Clayman to overlook.

But right now, the man in charge of the operation at the scene is Yamza, not Clayman.

Apart from that, Clayman's head has been preoccupied with the incoming Walpurgis Banquet. It holds a significant purpose.

The renowned autist (shut-in) Demon Lord Ramiris suddenly demanded to add on a proposal and requested to have the person in question, Rimuru to attend the Banquet.

Even Clayman could not have anticipated this turn of event, letting him unable to make a judgement for the time.

When he was concerning, everyone else just decided to accept the proposal. Now there is no room to rebut.

But at this point, the crisis may have turned into an opportunity.

*No, this is perfect in fact. In the end, Rimuru would show his true color. I almost got fooled around by him about him taking on the entire Farmus army alone and triumphed. You can't conceal a lie like that.*

Clayman gives off a cunning grin as he thinks so.

Since Rimuru wishes to join the Banquet, why not I welcome his participation.

Clayman just has to show the difference in strength between Rimuru and himself in front of the rest of the demon lords.

*A lowly slime tries to act all mighty with the aid of an evil dragon! You should feel honored to be defeated by my hands.*

Clayman thinks over about his glorious future.

---However, he has overlooked something.

Overlooked the slight lack of balance in the battlefield.

---Be careful Clayman! Don't act recklessly without thinking, and you'd better not get careless.

The words of his friend cross his mind for a second.

Clayman feels a sudden sense of unease.

It is almost as if it's telling him that he has missed out certain piece of the jigsaw.

But Clayman instead, decides to laugh it off.

*Don't worry, Laplace. I will win---*

As if he's trying to shake off the unease, Clayman downs the rest of the wine in a go.

![hard scene break]

Frey, with a worrying heart, prepares for the upcoming Walpurgis Banquet.

The situation has changed completely within a short period of time that it has completely deviated from the initial plan.

Now with everything developing out of her expectation, she has no idea what the outcome would be.

But Frey is not nervous about it.

She knows herself well that she will conduct everything calmly.

That is how "The Harpy Queen" Frey should behave.

It's definitely a good thing to have an ideal outcome, but if things continue to develop towards the wrong direction...

She has made up her mind to be personally involved if that time arrives.

Since she has made a deal with someone from that day onward.

In order to defeat Charybdis, she accepted a proposal from Clayman. Its cost being for Frey to agree to a request of Clayman.

.........

......

...

A few months ago, Milim came to visit Frey.

*Pang!* With that sound, she opened the door rudely and entered the room.

This happens too often, so Frey was somewhat accustomed to it.

Besides, if any such immense and unconcealed magical aura ever approaches, it's anyone guesses that it would be Milim.

Milim walked in to greet her immediately.

"Hey, Frey! Nice weather today!"

With smiles on her face, she didn't care whether Frey was available to receive her.

She also intentionally used her hand to brush through her beautiful cherry-gold hair.

There is some strange-looking object equipped on her fingers.

It's not a ring.

The young girl seems to have equipped a rough-edged knuckle used to protect four of her fingers.

But it seems rather fitting to Milim.

This skillfully crafted item is engraved with dragon patterns that possess strong magicule.

It doesn't look strange at all being held in her tiny hands.

"Hmm---Isn't it quite hot here?"

She said so while using her palm as a fan.

Milim has never been mindful of temperature before, so her motive is quite clear.

"Ara, Milim. Long time no see, you seem to be in a good mood today. Did something good happen to you?"

Frey asked as she played along with her. If she did not ask, Milim would continue to keep up the act with her till the ends of time.

"Hmm-hmm, can you tell? It's actually like this, check it out!"

Milim said so while showing off the dragon patterned knuckles on her hands.

And she shows off while saying "hehehe."

Frey didn't know what to do with her and could only sigh in her heart.

"Well indeed that's true! I think it suits you very well. How did you come across it?"

She guessed that Milim would want her to ask more, so she did.

Milim, on the other, hand starts to beat around the bush: "Do you want to know? Now what should I do---I guess I can tell you...Hmm---what to do, what to do---"

Annoying. Such an act is even irritating to Frey who's been used to her actions for all these years of interactions.

"Ah, Milim. Aren't we "Friends"? So it should be fine to tell me, right?"

Milim's eyes shines hearing Frey's words.

"That's right! Indeed, indeed. We are friends! All right, I'll tell you! As a matter of fact---"

She seemed happy hearing Frey's words. Milim then started to tell Frey all about the monster town happily.

Frey kept on listening to her unstopping bragging and was forced to admire different outfits of hers.

Frey couldn't hide her confusion since she has never seen Milim been in such a happy state.

But with that being said, Frey determined it was time to carry out her promise with Clayman.

"Right, Milim. As a "Friend", I would like to gift you something. Are you willing to take it?"

After which, Frey signaled her maid.

The maid brought an object to them.

It was a beautiful shining pendant with a purple fabric as a base.

The pendant has a beautiful orb engraved onto it. It's most certainly top-ranked goods, the type that even outsiders could tell it costs a fortune.

"Hmm? Isn't this a pendant? Can I take it? But I won't give you my knuckles even if I take this from you!"

Frey responded with a wry smile.

"No problem, Milim. This thing shall symbolize our friendship. Since it's a gift from 'Friend', you don't have to be courteous with me. I'd be happy if you are willing to wear it."

Frey hurries her with a kind smile, and Milim nods while smiling.

"Then just wait and see!"

After which, Milim puts it on her with a smile on her face.

<<Forbidden curse "Demon Lord Domination"... Conjured successfully.>>

At that moment, the expression on Milim's face faded instantly.

There was nothing else in her eyes, the light within them that symbolizes consciousness has faded away.

The pendant has released its magic and the forbidden curse has corrupted Milim.

This pendant was the secret jewel given to Frey by Clayman---The orb of domination. As for why she let Milim put on the pendant, it was because this was the deal, she made with Clayman.

*All right, I've done my part of the bargain. Then my duty is now done, what would happen to Milim---*

Frey begins to observe Milim.

She looks like a human doll with masquerade on, just standing there without any emotion.

For a moment, there were weak signs of struggle. Frey seemed to have crossed her eyes with Milim's blue eyes.

For that instant, Frey senses something was amiss.

Could it be---

*Right, that means... That's what it was, right, Milim---*

The dragon knuckles slipped through Milim's joints and fell.

Frey loosened her breath seeing this.

"It's done Clayman. Will this do?"

There was nothing in the shades of the room. Frey talked naturally towards a specific place.

There on the spot emerged a shadow, it was Clayman.

"Hohoho. Thanks for the trouble, Frey. Looks like now I've gained the strongest puppet! Gohahahaha! This is what happens when you look down on me as some newbie demon lord. How embarrassing you look now, Milim!"

Clayman lets out his laughter and begins to hit Milim hard with his hands.

Milim's tender cheek begins to swell and her lips are split.

Without the multiple "Barrier" to defend herself, even Milim would be injured.

This plus the opponent being Clayman, a demon lord.

Of course she would bleed.

Clayman, with a light smile on his face, decides to continue his attack, however Frey responded coldly: "I'd suggest you refrain yourself."

This is no comfortable scene to look at, besides---

"Huh! Don't you think that this curse is some cheap shot that would be deactivated with a couple of hits. This is a forbidden curse with a massive amount of my magic inserted. Aren't you annoyed too that she's always acting all smug? That's why you assisted me in the first place, right?"

"No. I did it to simply carry out our promise."

"Don't act all high and mighty now. You are welcome. This guy is just a puppet now, a very endurable one, as long as I repair it before breaking it completely."

Clayman's eyes showed signs of madness as he gives Milim a kick to send her flying away.

Frey looks at Clayman's actions with cold eyes.

*What an ugly man. So this is your nature---*

As such, Frey has seen through this man named Clayman. From now on, she decides to trust her instinct and take actions on her own.

"I mean, Clayman. You may not be aware but Milim has a self-defense mechanism. I once heard it from Milim that it is called 'Frenzy Berserk'. It would lead her to an uncontrolled state. You can go ahead and get yourself killed by it, just leave me out of it."

With Frey's reminder, Clayman finally regained calmness.

He smacks his lip with discontent.

"Tch, what's wrong with this demon lord... Anyway, if I play her right, I'll get more of a voice during my speech. Frey, you are my accomplice. So you'd better work for me like a doll."

"Are? Aren't we supposed to be on equal term?"

"You idiot! I made this plan. You are already my pawn. Or perhaps, you want to take a brawl with Milim?"

"---Are you threatening me?"

"Gohahahah! Whichever way you like to see it. If you don't want to die, you'd better stay on my good side."

To impose someone with both threats and compassion^[This is a Japanese idiom, 恩威並行 or 恩威並び行われる], that would be an appropriate phrase to describe Clayman's arrogant speech.

Indeed, the plan was made by Clayman, plus information from unknown sources. After all Milim can't quite resist the word "Friend".

Frey is merely following her deal.

But the reason why she committed to it was because she has faith in certain things---

"...I understand."

"That's right. Don't even think about betraying me. If you'd like to hear my request, I'll allow you to continue as 'Ruler of the sky'."

She is at the point of no return.

As such, Frey has fallen as Clayman's accomplice---or his puppet in reality.

---These are the events that took place several weeks before the day of destruction.

.........

......

...

Having withdrawn from the memory of that time, Frey sighs quietly.

Clayman has full control over Milim. With such violent power to back himself up, he's able to put high pressure on Frey as well.

Right now, Frey follows Clayman's order and is forced to be his accomplice.

This must have been her own doing---She mocks herself.

She was stupid enough to have trusted Clayman.

But, on the other hand.

Clayman is a cunning demon lord that can't be underestimated. He has too much confidence in his own strength.

---This is why it has colluded Clayman from seeing the nature of things.

But luckily, Frey possesses the insights to see the nature of things.

It is no skill, but simply the result of her interactions with other people.

Clayman only sees others as tools, thus he may never see the truth of things.

Frey decides to trust her own instinct and make a gamble.

No matter what the result is---

*Clayman, you won't live for any longer.*

Frey confirms the sequence of actions planned by her in heart.

Then she recalls the "Promise", and a smile crawls up her cheek without her noticing.

![hard scene break]

In the frozen land where the freezing breezes of icy wind blows.

The surrounding of this land consists of ice plains with permanently frozen soil. The temperature is below a hundred and twenty Celsius, which very few living beings could survive under.

A castle stands tall in the central area.

A castle of beauty and fantasy.

A demon fortress projected to the physical realm through the use of unimaginable amount of magicule.

Its name is "Palace of White Ice".

It is the residence of Demon Lord Guy Crimson.

Someone is stroking casually on the hallway of the castle.

The person has long blonde hair, below which his long and narrow blue eyes as well as his handsome appearance display a heavenly sight.

Those plus his smooth, white tender skin.

This is a handsome man with incredibly beautiful appearance that would make other question his gender.

He is Demon Lord Leon Cromwell, the so called "Platinum Demon" or "Platinum Saber".

He's treating the castle as if it's his home and stroking around the hallway without a care.

A giant door lies in front of him, along it are beautiful sculptures. This door leads to the main hall where the ruler of the castle awaits.

Leon came to look for the ruler Guy Crimson.

He stood before the door and waited for the two strong demons to come forth and open the door.

Afterward---

"Demon Lord Leon Cromwell-sama has arrived!"

A beautiful demon with female form stood in the inner side of the door and announces.

The powerful greater demons split into two rows and await by the two sides of the door.

They are all named demons with flesh. Their strength has already surpassed greater demon, and could even easily outrank greater majins.

They are all equipped with magical equipment and all seem to have evolved.

In total, there are around two hundred of them.

There are even ones that may rival Special A Calamity.

However, even though these demons are considered top-notch in strength...

Deep into the meeting hall, the demon lord Guy Crimson sits in his throne at the center. Right now there are six great demon lords awaiting his order. The rest of the demons seem far inferior when compared to the prestige displayed by the six.

![exact fit image](image6)

All six demons are named Greater Demon General.

They all possess combat abilities to crash many among the rank of Calamity. It is likely that they may even have power to rival demon lords.

---But, even these six Great Demon Generals are not allowed to speak without permission here. This is due to the uncrossable gap in authority---

Just now it was a green-hair demon that informed the hall of Leon's visit and a blue-hair demon that tended to him.

Their beautiful appearances are like human desire manifested.

Both of whose fit bodies are covered by dark red maid suits.

The green-hair demon is named Mizeri, the Blue-hair demon's is Raine.

They speak for their king.

These two great demons are the left and right hands of the absolute ruler Guy Crimson.

Their rank "Demon Noble", make them the strongest among the Calamity class.

Their power is sufficient to rival demon lords.

Leon walks down the central path and stops below the throne.

Mizeri and Raine bow to him and proceed to stand beside Guy on each side.

Meanwhile, the king stands up from his throne.

The only two persons who are permitted to move in the room are now only the two demon lords.

"Long time no see, my friend Leon. How have you been? I'm glad you've responded to my invitation. I should thank you for that."

That is a wonderfully alluring voice.

His crimson red eyes have sparkled gold stars within; His slightly curly hair looks scarlet red like burning flame, its redness is thicker than the color of blood.

He's about the same height as Leon.

As opposed to Leon's feminine beauty, Guy's beauty comes from a place of pride and lonesomeness.

Such eerily bizarre beauty exudes the aura of an overlord.

He speaks to Leon and starts to move down from his high throne to Leon's face. His hands gradually wrapped around Leon's chest and hugs him close tightly.

His hands continue to move and fondle along Leon's face, and without hesitation, kisses him.

Leon's face frowns with disgust and pushes Guy away. He starts to complain as usual:

"Stop it. I'm not interested in men. Haven't I told you this several times already?"

His face looks confused as it stares at Guy angrily.

"Ahahaha. You are such a cold man as always. But if that's what you want, I'm fine with being a woman. But let's put that aside and change a place to talk."

Guy sounds rather pleased this time and starts to move before hearing Leon's response.

This scene plays out every time.

In this frozen land, Guy wears a truly unique outfit.

The outfit he wears have many openings, exposing his skin.

But even so, as a demon, Guy doesn't mind coldness. To him it does not even tickle him.

A sudden bewitching smile emerges on Guy's beautiful face as he recalls the taste of Leon's lip.

He licks his bloody lips with his snake-like tongue... It's a rather intriguing scenery that bears a devilish charm.

Guy could switch his gender at will, and both men and women can invoke his lust.

That is him---her---This is the Demon Lord Guy Crimson.

The owner of this castle, the strongest, most ancient demon lord---The overlord of this forever frozen continent, who rules in the name of "Lord of Darkness".

Guy didn't tend to Leon and walk in front by himself.

Leon naturally follows behind him.

Before the two could exit the hall, no one present dares to make a single noise.

Since that is not permitted.

Everyone bows their heads low and await quietly before their master and the guest to leave.

After confirming Leon has left, Mizeri and Raine raise up.

They thus say:

"Dismiss."

Raine herself also gives order to several subordinates.

Mizeri and Raine thus leave to prepare tea for the guest.

They have the highest position among the demons in the castle, and their role, however, happen to be taking care of their master, Demon Lord Guy Crimson's daily chores.

There's not any work more important than theirs in this castle.

---Before their master loses his temper, they'd better hurry up with their work.

.........

......

...

Leon followed Guy to the top of the frost balcony.

Although the location is open to outside, not a single flake of snow is allowed to enter.

It has been made into a comfortable space after accommodation.

Guy isn't affected by the environment at all. However, the air-conditioning mechanism is specially made for Leon.

Guy is arrogant and prideful, but he's very caring towards those who he recognizes and his friends.

Guy's still the same way. Leon thinks to himself while he sits down with Guy's invitation.

The chair is made of ice, yet the there is no sense of chilliness felt from it.

Leon though isn't surprised at all. He instead inquires:

"So, why did you call me here?"

He falls back to his chair as the ice chair catches him gently.

The same as usual.

Somehow an ice table appears out of nowhere, and Raine begins to serve tea to them.

Mizeri quietly awaits outside of the balcony entrance.

They won't at all interfere with the conversation between their master and his guest. Not a single word is permitted to be spoken.

There is no equal relationship here. Before they receive their order, they can't even express any emotion.

If they are to do anything without Guy's order, they would be gifted with death on the spot.

It matters little that they are "Demon Noble" with immense power. They are nothing but tools in front of demon lord such as Guy.

That's how strong Guy is.

This is why even if Leon launches an attack on Guy, they will not intervene on their own.

Guy is the absolute ruler and it would be a great disrespect to even worry about Guy's safety.

That's why they are being treated like air. And the conversation continued.

"Hmm. As you can see, the Walpurgis Banquet is about to start. But I mean to take you there even by force this time."

"Ho? Forcing me to participate? That's unusual."

"Yeah. Consider doing me a favor, but I'm getting you to attend regardless!"

"---Why is that?"

"Ha, you're still the same way, always so careful. Very well, perhaps I'll fill you in then---"

Guy shows a joyful smile and said so, thus begins his explanation.

"---The one proposing the meeting this time is Clayman, no one special. But the strange thing is Milim was listed as seconder. Milim is one of the most ancient demon lord like me, how could she be playing along some scum like Clayman? It can only mean---"

"There's something strange about Karion's death. Is that where you are trying to get?"

"Ehh, so you do know about it."

Guy's mood got a lot worse having been guessed what he's trying to say. But Leon didn't seem to care and continues with his words:

"Clayman really went above the line this time. He's always been causing trouble for me without leaving any trace, but this time I can't just sit and take it. Apart from the whereabout of Karion, it'll be trouble if Milim moves out."

He says so.

Hearing so, Guy nods happily.

"Hmm, that's exactly my thought. It may be a game to Milim just like before, but if the balance among demon lords are to be broken, it won't be child's play anymore. I'll certainly have to do more work."

Guy regained his good mood, followed by Leon who asks the most pressing question:

"By the way, Guy. Do you think Milim have been manipulated by Clayman?"

The question is asked, but Guy's response shows his lack of care towards the issue.

"It won't matter much to worry over Milim's business. Smart people like me will never understand what an idiot is thinking. That is one of my few weaknesses."

He shrugs as he finishes and throws a smile him a smile. Then he turns the topic back on the original question.

"Look how concerned you look now. Leon, does this mean you are interested in taking part in the Banquet, right?"

There is no use trying to probe the thoughts of one another, so Leon decides to reply honestly:

"Yeah, I was planning to. Although I hate to spend time around others, I guess I'll have to participate this time."

"Oh? That's great. And I was planning to spend the night with you (on bottom) then---"

"I told you I don't do it with man. And even if it's a woman, I won't do it with ones I don't like. Plus I don't get stand to gain anything sleeping with you..."

"Ehhh, don't be so hasty now. If you really mean it, I can turn myself into a woman..."

As soon as Leon finishes, Guy begins to harass Leon all seductive looking. But Leon has expected that and gave him a perfect counter.

The two often play this game of offense and defense.

"Right, Leon. Ramiris seldom expresses her opinion, so how much do you know about the person called "Rimuru"?"

Since Leon won't bite, Guy changes to another topic.

This is also related to the topic at hand. There has been new demon lord after Leon, and the rest of the demon lords seem to be interested in this topic as well.

"From Clayman's testimony, he seemed to have crowned himself the title Demon Lord without our approval. I personally think that this Rimuru guy can be a demon lord if he is powerful enough."

"Oh, so you think he's qualified. Ramiris also came to stir the pot. I'm rather intrigued by this whole ordeal since it was sufficient to get her interest. I definitely can have some fun with this Rimuru."

Clayman was the one initiating the Banquet, and with Ramiris' request, the person involved Rimuru would also join.

So they can safely deduce that Ramiris has a say to Clayman's action this time.

"---Ramiris, well. I'm no good against that elf. Every time we meet, she makes fun of me. I kinda want to strangle her to death for a few times..."

But even so, since Ramiris has already spoken, Leon could only nod in agreement. He still feels some moral responsibility towards her, so he has to comply.

"Ahahaha. Come on now. If you kill Ramiris, I'll become your enemy then."

"I thought as much. But it's me saying. Plus I stand no chance against you anyway."

That's true.

Leon only dislikes Ramiris for making fun of him, he doesn't really mean any harm to her.

Besides, Leon stands no chance winning against Guy. That part is true too. Despite both of them are all demon lords, their difference in power is heaven and earth.

Guy's power is almost from a different dimension compared to people like Leon and Mizeri.

"Hmm? How could that be? If it is you, you still have a one in a million chance to kill me, you know?"

"No way. I only fight battles that I can win."

"Come on, don't be so modest. Basically, there're very few people who can hurt me. I may actually die in your hand, since you are a powerful guy, Leon."

"Heh, you don't say. It's because you are Milim are way too strong. Speaking of being unreasonably strong---"

Leon recalls something while saying so.

---He heard that "Storm Dragon" Veldora has awakened.

That would be a first that Leon has surprised Guy.

Suddenly, a voice cold as ice interrupts the two's conversation.

"Ara ara, now that is intriguing."

The owner of the voice is a beautiful female.

One with snow white skin like porcelain.

Her eyes that emits cold light is seductive and they are blue like the deep sea.

Her pearl-white hair droops down along her cheek and her light red lips look extremely eye-catching.

The woman walked forward and spoke without Guy's permission.

She possesses a beautiful aura around her more shining than jewels. People call her "Ice Empress".

Or perhaps---

She has a better-known name, "Frost Dragon" Velzard.

She is the one of the four remaining "True Dragon", a friend---and partner to the Demon Lord Guy Crimson.

In other words, she gets to sit on equal ground to Guy like Leon.

"Oh, It's Velzard. That being said, I almost forgot that there is a 'True Dragon' here too."

Leon plays dumb and says.

"Ayy? Aren't you cold as always? But, I'm pretty happy you decided to show up."

"Is that so? I also get to have a eyes' full of you."

Leon and Velzard exchanges some polite greets.

Both' are pretenses.

"Huh. You two are always like this, just can't get along with each other."

Guy's rather irritated while saying so.

With that being said though, Guy doesn't plan to help mitigate their relation at all.

If it's usual, they would continue to exchange those fake-sounding courtesy, but---

"...Right, so as you were saying..."

This time, Velzard took the initiative in changing the topic.

"Leon-sama, did you just say that my "younger brother" has awaken?"

Her blue eyes shine as she asks, meaning to see if Leon's shocking news is true or not.

"Is that true, Leon?"

"His presence disappears around two years ago, and I thought he was gone for good."

If Veldora is revived, the overwhelming magicule outburst will most certainly cause drastic change to climate of the land for them to notice. However, there was no sign of such a thing.

That's why both Guy and Velzard are surprised.

"There's no way around it. The source came from the spies I sent to the western states."

"Oh...? If that's true, why have that evil dragon been so quiet? Has he weakened so much that he can't even resupply his own magicule on his own?"

"On top of that, who could have broken the seal on that child? I thought he doesn't possess the power to break it by himself---"

Veldora was sealed by a Chosen Hero^[Differentiate Chosen Hero (勇者) and Hero (英雄). In English, this two words are interchangeable and would be justified to use "hero" for both in most cases. However, in the Slime series,"Chosen Hero" is a title like "Demon Lord", entailing the owner of the title to be the protector of mankind. A hero on the other hand can be anyone with remarkable achievements such as "Hero Youm". There are only handful of Chosen Heroes in slime so I'll use this to differentiate them from other "Hero".].

In Veldora's view, it was the appropriate punishment for her reckless brother. So she has intentionally left the seal as it was.

If he reflects himself well and finally decides to be a doll. Velzard would have given him a helping hand before he gets completely eliminated.

When Veldora first disappeared from the world, she was rather confused. Since the time of his destruction seems too early compared to the time Velzard has predicted.

"From the report of the spy, Clayman's conspiracy seems to have been the main cause. He forced the western state to take actions, the great kingdom of Farmus to be particular. He found people to instigate them to invade and eliminate the Jura Forest Alliance built by Rimuru. As it turns out, the Farmus army was completely decimated. And now Rimuru comes out and calls himself a demon lord."

"You know your stuff well, Leon."

"Of course. Unlike you, I used to be human. Apart from that, I confirmed that Veldora was indeed resting near the frontline of the battle. It is rumored that the truth of the matter is that Veldora, almost near his demise was able to awake after absorbing the large amount of blood tainted on the battlefield."

Rimuru was able to escape from danger after Farmus army was involved in this whole ordeal and was eliminated completely. Leon adds on top of his explanation.

"So that was the case. Then was the breaking of seal just a coincidence?"

"Don't know. I wasn't informed on that matter."

That's true too, Velzard nods in response.

Leon's correct, there's no way to judge that simply from espionage.

The Chosen Hero's Unique Skill 'Infinite Prison' was able to lock the targeted object into an imaginary space. It isn't weak enough to have it revoked from the affected individual trapped inside. But even if that's the case, the presence of Veldora has yet to influence the world.

"Perhaps there's some flaws with Chosen Hero's seal..."

That would make more sense.

Velzard thinks so, yet Leon expresses something unexpected to her.

"That's possible. But allow me to propose a theory. What if someone created a subspace that absorbed both Veldora and the seal?"

The theory interests with Guy as well.

"Interesting! If that's the case, this unknown individual could then unlock the Chosen Hero's seal. That seal seems to have a special tie with the Chosen Hero and cannot be undone using normal skills. It may be solvable if we are the one dealing with it, in other words, this mysterious person has power to rival us."

Guy says so with great pleasure.

"But regardless, it's just a possibility."

"So you think that mysterious individual is "Rimuru", right, Leon?"

"---That's right."

"I see. If that's the case, I do need to meet him."

And Guy thought Leon's difference in attitude in attending the meeting is a rare sight of a lifetime. But if this is the case, that would certainly make more sense. Guy finally realizes.

Clayman is being reckless.

Milim has been acting weird.

And Rimuru proclaims himself demon lord alongside with Veldora losing his seal.

If we assume all of these events are all connected...

This Walpurgis Banquet has indeed become very interesting. An intoxicating smile emerges on Guy's face as he thinks so.

But suddenly something came up on his mind that concerns him, Guy starts to mumble:

"But speaking of that, why has Veldora become so quiet?"

Velzard makes the following response.

"---He seems to have become weak. The reaction is extremely weak, hardly as powerful as before."

Velzard is also a "True Dragon", so Veldora's presence hasn't been so weak that she can't find with some efforts.

It would make the most sense if it due to him becoming weaker...

"But, it's rather disappointing that he hasn't gone on a rampage by now. If it's that child's personality, chaos is his way of life."

Velzard also doesn't get why that was the case.

"Anyhow, it doesn't matter. I'm not really interested in Veldora. If you guys want to get him on board, then be my guest."

Leon says so without a care and decides to stand up from his seat.

Unlike Velzard who are the same race as Veldora, or Guy who is worrying about what to about him, this is all none of Leon's business. As long as Veldora stays away from Leon's territory, he won't actively care about what Veldora does.

That is how difficult it is to deal with the evil dragon Veldora.

"Are you leaving already?"

"Yeah, didn't you call me for these?"

"Ehh, just wait a little longer, don't be in such a rush? Right, have you got any closer to your "specific summoning"?"

In order to prevent Leon from leaving, Guy asks him about the result of his experiments.

It is after all; experiments Leon spent all his life investing. So Guy is also quite interested in the result.

"...Well, about that, I haven't made much progress. I've changed my method to random summoning, but it always ended up in failure. It's also attracting too much attention. I had intentionally theorized "incomplete summoning" and leaked the news to the western states. But then the Freedom Association began to intervene. The current method is hardly efficient considering the probabilities, and since there may be more people come and try to intervene. I am considering trying an alternative in the future."

Honestly, Leon has little interest for the Walpurgis Banquet or the new demon lord.

He simply wants to eliminate any possible threat that may intervene his research early. That is all he cared.

"You said intervention?"

"Yeah. They saved a bunch of kids who were going to die anyway---before I could receive the them."

"I see. So they were taken away by force before you got the results. Then, these rescuers would likely intervene in the future too."

"That's probably the case. That guy seems to be also annoyed by the summoning of children around the countries, so he may even pressure these countries. Given the circumstance, I won't continue my experiment. If I am to continue, I may get exposed of being behind the scene one day."

"Hmm, why don't you just eliminate the nuisance?"

It should be a chore if it's you right? Guy sends the signal through his eyes.

But Leon instead sighs to Guy's words.

"The nuisance individual happens to be the "Rimuru" I just mentioned."

"Nani? Could this really be just coincidence?"

"Isn't that interesting? That's why I wish to see him as well."

Leon nods looking all serious.

With that being said, had Ramiris not come and stir the pot, he may have overlooked the issue...

"Is that so, now I'm even more interested in him. Perhaps Milim thought the same way like me. That girl may be silly, but her instinct is quite keen."

"Perhaps. Anyway, there's gonna be hell of a show during tonight's Banquet."

"Hehe, that's right."

Upon saying so, the two smiles at each other.

Velzard observes the two on the side with a gentle look in her blue eyes.

After that they continued to chat with joy for a while before Guy changed the subject:

"Speaking of which, I've been curious about something. Who is the supplier of your intelligences all this time?"

"He apparently came from the Eastern Empire. I've got no clue about the detail. He's a self-proclaimed merchant."

In order to summon otherworlder, it requires a large amount of magicule, specific conditions and rituals. There are many complicated factors involved.

The more sufficient one prepares with these factors in mind, the longer interval it will be for one to prepare a second summoning.

That is why Leon has made a deal with that merchant to have him conduct the summoning in his place.

"So, is this merchant trust-worthy?"

"Trust? I have no use for that, I'm simply manipulating him for now."

"Is that so? Do what you like, I've got no objection. But don't get careless with it! I won't allow you to die without my permission."

"Hehehe, are you worrying about me? How rare, Guy. Don't worry. I won't just die without achieving my goal."

"Here we go again... Is that thing really this important?"

"Yeah it is. To me, it's the most important thing in the world."

"Is that so? That makes me jealous."

"Spare the sweet talk. I'll keep your advice in mind. Then, I'll see you tonight."

With that being said, Leon leaves the castle.

This time Guy did not try to stop him.

There are crystals of light^[Not sure what this is exactly, apparently it refers the remains of some beams of light as Leon leaves.] left at the scene as Leon exits with "Spatial Movement".

Two pairs of eyes observe as he departed.

"He's always in such a rush. Well, that's Leon for you..."

Guy gives off a wry smile while saying so.

"But Leon has always been cautious. Yet this time his plans are flawed with exploits. He doesn't seem to know the identity of his assistor. Should we help him to find it out?"

Velzard asks in a cold tone.

"No need for that. If we trespass his business too much, Leon would be upset. I don't wish to be disliked by my friend."

Guy answers, without a shred of worry. To Guy, his friend Leon is a trustworthy man. He said so knowing Leon's personality. He knows it better than anymore that Leon is a hardworking guy. If Leon never sought to uncover the identity of his assistors, it simply means that it's not necessary for him.

"I'll help him out when he does come to seek help from me."

"I understand."

After which, the two ended the discussion.

Now, the list of attendees of tonight's Walpurgis Banquet has been settled.

The proposers are Clayman, Frey and Milim.

And of course Ramiris who requested an amendment of participant.

The shut-in Leon has also decided to join.

There's another person who hates to show up in public. That demon lord's whereabout has been unknown. But Guy has forced the person out using demon lords' special communication channel.

Additionally, there are Guy's old friend Dagruel and a certain other... He won't need to worry about him since Dagruel has agreed to bring him along.

Lastly, it's Guy himself.

Apart from Karion, who has been missing for some time. The Ten Great Demon Lords are finally reuniting after some time.

"This seems to be fun. Do you want to come along?"

"About that... No, I'll pass. But it will be a different case if I see my brother there, otherwise I'm not interested in demon lords."

"Is that so? It matters not. Then you can look after the house for me."

"Sure, leave it to me. You should go get ready too now."

Velzard leaves her seat after saying so.

Now only Guy remains. He looks far away to what seems to be the polar light spread on this frozen land and has his mind fixed on the Walpurgis Banquet.

Demon lords who only plays tricks and sabotages behind everyone's back.

Someone supposedly is a new demon lord yet got destroyed so easily.^[Still have no clue what this means after referring to JP source. But I think it's referring to Karion.]

His shut-in friend also got a move-on, which makes him reminiscent of the past.

And the birth of a new demon lord.

Interesting.

His mood hasn't been so hyped up for several hundred years.

It's time for some major reforms.

After all, the demon lords are never companions, but competing opponents.

At first, the number of demon lords are not limited to ten persons. In fact, there was once a time that there were more than dozens of demon lords.

It matters very little whether is it ten or a hundred.

If you can't do your part, you will get eliminated through the "Great War Between Angels and Demons"(Tenma Daisen) commenced every five hundred years.

There are always new power rising through the great war. But gradually the cap of members was fixed to ten persons. To the people who are aware of this, they thus call them the Ten Great Demon Lords.

But that's not approved by Guy.

To humans, it would be in their best interests to have the dangerous demon lords continued to fight against each other's rule and reduce in number through the process. But somehow, the Ten Great Demon Lords become an unspoken rule.

But this rule is about to be struck off.

The weak does not deserve the title "Demon Lord".

It's about time for the real deal to dominate the world again.

---That is Guy's opinion.

Guy was the first demon lord.

As one of the Seven Primordial Demons, he was summoned to earth as a Greater Demon General.

---The unnamed Primordial Red (Rouge) was unleashed to the world that day.

He granted the wishes of the humans without power to decimate what was suspected to their hostile nations in war against. He later also destroyed the human kingdom that summoned him.

As his reward, he gained this name.

The desperate sighs of humans that he heard sounded similar to the word "Guy". It became his name.

After obtaining a name, Guy discovered that he has awakened to be a true demon lord. Although to Guy, who had already believed deeply that he is the strongest being, the power was unnecessary.

Due to Guy's evolution, it also affected the Primordial Green (Vert) and Primordial Blue (Bleu) who were summoned to do his chores.

The two, who were called the shadow of Primordial Red, gained body like Guy and became "Demon Noble".

Guy, intrigued at the time, allowed them to follow him and granted them names.

Primordial Green was named according the painful expression displayed on the humans, "Mizeri".

Primordial Blue was named according to the red rain due to the bloodshed, "Raine".

From that day onward, he granted both permission to stay around him.

Sometime after Guy awaked to become a demon lord, it didn't take long before someone else awaked to become a true demon lord.

That someone was Milim. The ancestors of the four "True Dragons" emerged to the physical world and bred with humans.

What incredible thing was that the "True Dragon" who reproduced with humans were deprived of most of its power by their offspring. From then on, the breeding of True Dragon and Human became a taboo.

The true dragon who lost its power exploded into pieces. But it was successful in obtaining flesh on the ground world. It became the ancestors of dragon race.

The future generation would instead call the "Holy Will of Nature" as the "True Dragon".

Nowadays, the dragon race is able to prosper on this land and its origin can all be traced to this one ancestor dragon.

That was the "True Dragon"---"Star King Dragon" Veldanava.

The "Star King Dragon" Veldanava gifted his his reincarnated self---a small dragon to her daughter as a pet.

That small dragon was killed in a certain kingdom.

Those fools enraged the tyrant Milim.

Her fury tore through the sky and earth as she destroyed the country.

And later Milim was awakened to be a true demon lord.

---As Milim, who has lost her reasoning, continued on to rain destruction on the world.

The one that came forth and stopped her was Guy.

They fought seven days and nights.

They fought until the world turned dark, rendering the prosper land of the west a land of death.

But in the end, neither were able to come to a conclusion of victory.

Due to Milim regaining her senses, the battle got to be ended.

The one that restored her reasoning was Ramiris. She came down to the earth as the Queen of Elves and utilized all of power to neutralize the hatred within Milim.

But the price was nonetheless high.

Ramiris' power gradually dissipate due to the tainting of both the evil spirit of both Dragon and Demon. In the end she fell from grace and ended up where she is today. A fairy who is in perpetual reincarnations.

Although the price was so high, she was successful in stopping Milim from continuing her rampage.

To prevent world destruction, both Guy and Milim accepted a truce.

These three were the original demon lords.

Three persons pursued three different goals.

One pursued absolute power.

One wanted to live life freely.

One hoped for world peace.

But those would suffice.

The three got to know each other precisely for their difference in end goals.

After that, the Titan guarding the gateway to the sky and the ancient Vampire also become demon lord. The Fallen angel then took the sixth seat.

These are the second generation.

They are far from the ancient demon lords, but nonetheless, the pinnacle of the strong who may rule the world.

The Titan, due to the holy element he inherently possesses, has yet to show any unique character of a demon lord. But he is also a rather intriguing individual who possesses extraordinary power.

The ancient vampire is cunning and loves to come up with deviant ideas.

But the current generation of it doesn't seem as powerful as before, but perhaps---

The sixth seat is a special case.

He has undeniable strength, but he seems to have very little interest in the current life.

That's why he enjoys sloth. He has everything to become a king, yet he still leads a lifestyle of sloth.

There are in total six persons including Guy, apart from the Titan and the fairy, the remaining four all have awakened.

They are all survivors of several Tenma Great War; their abilities have undergone countless trials and prevailed.

Just like Guy and Milim, it shouldn't be any surprise if they have obtained some Ultimate Skils.

Apart from that, there's also Guy's friend Leon.

Leon was originally a human and a "Chosen Hero".

Due to encountering some special circumstances, he obtained his Ultimate Skil.

He's a strong man even recognized by Guy.

As such, there are seven persons in total.

*I wonder, how many people would be able to be an equal to all seven of them during this Walpurgis Banquet.* Guy smiles joyfully having stumbled on the thought.

---Clayman.

This fool tried to control Milim.

What an absolute joke, it's hard enough for one to even try to hide from laughing at it.

His goal is nothing but a lunatic's raving.

Mere Clayman couldn't possibly be able to achieve something even Guy can't do.

Those who possess Ultimate Skils cannot be affected by low level skills.

In this world's rule, only those who've obtained "Unique Skills" could resist against the strong control of magic.

They should still be subjected to elemental attacks that could target their weakness. But speaking of that, there's no way mind control would ever work. Whoever's mind is so fragile that can be manipulated with such skill could never obtain Ultimate Skils.

Ultimate Skils, as they're called, are devices to grant access to the ultimate principles of this world.

That is why, in order to combat against an Ultimate Skil, one must employ Ultimate Skil as well.

That is simply how this world works.

Clayman can't even touch Milim.

That would mean, everything has been under Milim's control.

*What an absolute fool---*

Guy shows a small smile and decide to observe how things go in silent.

The time when the weak can pose as demon lords is finally over.

The imposters shall be eliminated while the real demon lords assume rule.

Guy gives off a big pretty smile as he believes the arrival of the day is imminent.

---Afterward, the Walpurgis Banquet filled with climaxes unveils itself.
