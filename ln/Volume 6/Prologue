# Prologue: Majins'|Conspiracy

"I-I'm dying here, seriously..."

As Laplace speaks, he emerges before another man in the room.

As mentioned just now, his body is heavily wounded.

"You've taken quite a beating now, haven't you?"

The owner of the room, a black-haired young man, responds rather coldly.

This reaction provokes Laplace, prompting him to start complaining in a rude tone.

"Hold on a second here, wasn't this supposed to be some simple walk-in-the-park task? The infiltration was hard---much harder than anticipated but escaping from there was even more difficult. No ordinary man can get through that even with multiple lives..."

"That's because I have faith in you. That, and you can't be killed anyways."

"I see you're still as cruel as ever."

Laplace begins fake crying, but the young man continues without displaying any emotions.

"So, what did you learn from investigating the Western Holy Church?"

"---About that... I really don't wanna say this but... I seriously can't find anything."

The young man remains impassive as he listens to Laplace's report.

His reaction, or lack thereof, towards this report makes it feel almost as if he expected to hear it; he lets out a grin and replies:

"Oi---why are you doing this again, why can't you ever just be honest? You've probably already discovered something by now, haven't you?"

Laplace shrugs and sighs upon hearing the young man's reply.

"Ya got me there. These pieces of information were all really difficult to obtain, and I was planning to sell them at a high price. Yet you've seen through me like it was nothing. I'll accept this defeat."

"Hehehe, it makes me happy to hear your praises like this. But still, don't expect a bonus, okay?"

Hearing this, Laplace sighs: "What a mean character."

"Hey now, don't say that. I did say I'd give you the payment as agreed upon. Anyway, the consciousness of "that thing" has already been settled. I've transferred the demon lord inside me into the body of a homunculus."

The young man smiles gleefully at this declaration. He then rings a bell and summons the secretary that seemed to have been waiting outside of the room.

"Did you summon me?"

She looks elegant and dignified---a model secretary through and through.

Her beauty is decorated by pure, white skin which perfectly accentuates her braided blonde hair.

Her eyes are bright blue in color as if shining with mysterious lazurite.

However, while the light in her eyes looks enthralling somehow, it does not seem to bear ill will.

"Huh? Eh, could you be...?"

Laplace becomes suspicious of the woman's appearance, yet in her eyes, Laplace finds a familiar presence. He then seems to recognize her true identity, and the realization quells his inner confusion. He bursts into laughter.

"Why are ya dressing like this? Has your highness undergone a sex change? I'd say it hardly suits you to dress like this. It's completely different from what you used to look like."

"Shut up. It took me ten years to obtain a body that I can move around freely in. These types of inconveniences are more than tolerable."

The woman replies rudely, not willing to let Laplace berate her.

Her model secretary like behavior disappears as she intimately pats Laplace on the shoulder and lets out ruffian laughter without a care. Then she sits down on a chair.

"So, you let me meet this guy means I can put down the act now, right?"

"No, I hope you can still keep up the act at least on the outside. But since we're all familiar with each other here, it would be unnecessary."

"Oh? I suppose I'll just do as the boss says then. But for what reason exactly?"

"About that, it's because currently you are still too weak, Kazalim. You've yet to recover your full power, right? Until you've regained your full strength as the 'Cursed Lord', you should just sit back and observe Clayman."

Kazalim, the woman who looks like a secretary, sighed with discontent at his reply.

Kazalim.

That is the name of an ancient demon lord. There once was a human named Leon who proclaimed himself a demon lord near the border of Kazalim's domain. Kazalim had then attempted to punish Leon for such bold declarations but was unsuccessful in the end.

And this former Demon Lord Kazalim is the being that both Demon Lord Clayman and Laplace wish to revive, and who also happens to be the president of the Moderate Jester Troupes.

Yet nowadays, Kazalim is no longer in possession of such power and thus assumes the body of a fragile woman.

While near death, Kazalim was able to possess the flesh of this young man in a fateful encounter and thus cheated death. A few days earlier the former demon lord's Astral Body was finally successfully transferred to the physical body of this homunculus.

Right now, his power is much weaker than it was during the days of his prime. As a result, Kazalim decided to recognize the young man as his master and to serve as his subordinate. This was the agreement between Kazalim and the young man, which is why he made no objections.

Having spent his time with the young man for ten years, Kazalim fully recognized him as his master.

"That's right. My power has yet to fully recover. I was defeated by that Demon Lord Leon so badly that I even lost my physical body. Sure my soul is able to settle in this homunculus, but this body is too fragile. If I am to fully release my magicules within it, it would completely destroy this body. That wouldn't be a revival at all..."

"Is that so, now I see. So even the president is calling you boss. In that case, I too shall accept you as my boss. You are no longer just another client. I guess there's no reason to hide anything from you anymore."

"Seriously? You are one stubborn idiot. We've been collaborating for so long, and I even helped you revive your most precious president. Yet you still wouldn't believe me till now..."

"Hahaha, that's a totally different matter. Speaking of which, the president taking on the appearance of a super model is absolutely hilarious!"

"---Is that so? I don't really care about my appearance."

"No no no, the contrast between how ya look and how ya talk is just too much; it's absolutely hilarious."

"Whatev---No, I understand now. If I must keep up this act, I need to talk more like a woman."

"No no no, that isn't the problem here, is it? Anyhow, it kinda suits ya better... But, how should I put this... WHAHAHAHA!"

Laplace bursts into laughter, unable to continue.

"Oh now, please shut your trap. It's not like I wanted to end up like this. This body is a Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion's specially modified homunculus that boss has prepared just for me."

"Yeah. It's quite expensive. If we didn't prepare the container devoid of a soul, it may have contaminated the transferred soul, resulting in a failed transfer. Speaking of which, if Kazalim hadn't escaped into my body, it might have already been mixed up with impurities and would have made it impossible to separate. In other words, I can't really help with how it looks."

"I really appreciate that, Boss."

But there was no joy in the voice of this young man and Kazalim expresses gratitude towards him. Even so, he still seems rather irritated and was only able to bring his good mood back after Laplace joined in expressing thanks.

"I guess I'll let it go this time. I get that you two must be experiencing a lot of feelings right now, reuniting after such a long time, but I want to talk business now. Let's hear the results of your investigations, Laplace."

With that, Kazalim loses his smile and turns towards Laplace. Laplace also nods back, changing his attitude, and starts talking in a more serious manner:

"Since you kept your part of this bargain and granted my wish, I would like to show you my sincerity as well. I've infiltrated the Western Holy Church, wishing to discover its secrets. Yet I was unable to discover any deeper truths."

Laplace says as he begins to describe his investigation in detail.

Laplace's mission this time was to investigate the secrets hidden within the organization called the 'Western Holy Church'.

This organization in particular is based in the Holy Empire of Lubelius and claims to be an independent religious organization.

They portray themselves as "The Just Protectors of The Weak" and have significant influence over the western states. To the young man, this organization stands as an obstacle between him and his goals. This is why he hired Laplace, a member of the Moderate Jester Troupe jack of all trades, to help find any exploitable weaknesses.

The young man believes that there's a hidden dark side to the Western Holy Church.

If they are indeed agents of justice as they're meant to be, he will have to resort to damaging their reputation by any means possible. But that would be his last draw.

Now is not the time to strike yet.

This is because the Western Holy Church also happens to have the strongest of the Saints, the Commander of the Holy Imperial Guards, Hinata Sakaguchi.

However, Laplace isn't finished yet.

"And then, since Hinata was absent, I got to infiltrate the church, but I didn't find anything suspicious. So I decided to go to the Holy City of Lubelius and check out the holy 'Inner Sanctum' at the top of the Spirit Mountain."

As he becomes more and more excited with his explanation, Laplace begins to gesticulate with his hands and feet.

There, he witnessed something with his own eyes. A fearsome truth that he laid eyes upon.

"I was really surprised, you know. The holy land was filled with a holy aura."

"Isn't that only natural? It's a holy land after all."

"Did ya hit your head or what? Have you become dumber since I last saw you?"

"No way, I definitely did not! By the way, president, your old tone is back again."

"Again with the same shi~~t~~---My business is irrelevant. Please proceed."

Skeptical about the treatment he's receiving, Laplace continues to report everything he saw.

.........

......

...

After sneaking past the Western Holy Church headquarters, Laplace found himself before the Temple of Gods. This is the hall of the Pope, who acts as the Agent of God, but it is also the place where politics are managed.

As he entered the Temple of Gods, he started to feel something is amiss with the surroundings. He sensed a weak flow of magic that would affect one's psyche.

Laplace possesses the Unique Skill 'Deceiver' and because of its defense mechanism, he was able to detect the existence of such intricate magic.

*That's a surprise. I didn't anticipate there to be mental magic on par with my own here...*

From there on, Laplace became more cautious and proceeded towards the Holy Church carefully.

Laplace had some knowledge about the enemy organization. However, he had little to no idea about the connection between this Western Holy Church and the Holy Empire of Lubelius.

The Western Holy Church worships the monotheistic god Luminas as their deity. It's the same case for Holy Empire of Lubelius, and it can be said that both are disciples in the religion of Luminism.

But in terms of power, the Western Holy Church far outranks Lubelius.

The reason being Hinata.

The reasons why the Western Holy Church have grown to become such an elite organization are all thanks to the achievements of Hinata Sakaguchi, who dispatched knights to branches of the church in western states, organized group efforts to protect the weak, and more.

The Western Holy Church was once an organization that spread the teachings of their Goddess Luminas under the protection of the Holy Empire of Lubelius. Nowadays they've suddenly become "The Just Protector of The Weak" and lost their ties as a serving organization under the Holy Empire of Lubelius.

The reason of this transformation is the Holy Knight Order, which Hinata personally trained. They are the real issue.

They are the strongest human knights--- and the Holy Knight Order consists of many of these holy knights.

Even Laplace considers them to be difficult to deal with. The Holy Knight Order does not follow the Holy Empire of Lubelius but instead follows their one true Goddess, Luminas---In other words, they follow Hinata's every command, as she herself is a disciple of Luminas.

This is the reason why the Western Holy Church was able to cut its ties with the Holy Empire of Lubelius, thus becoming a force of its own.

But there was another problem.

The Holy Empire of Lubelius' military is not exclusively made up of the Holy Knight Order.

There is also the regular army of the Holy Empire of Lubelius, namely the Imperial Guards which serve under the Pope's direct command. This regiment serving the Pope is another difficult organization to deal with.

They preach the saying "in God's name, all men are born equal", which allowed them to garner a variety of talents to serve in the Order.

The conditions for joining are very straight forward: be a faithful follower of Luminas and have combat capability above rank A.

The conditions seem simple on paper but are more difficult to achieve in practice, which is why the number of knights in the regiment is so small. However, they are all exceptional fighters or mages who are allowed to recruit their own subordinates. This is why the Imperial Guards are not a force to be trifled with.

Even within such a powerful organization, Hinata is still said to be head and shoulders above everyone else as the top knight. Moreover, the archon (leader/highest ranking officer) of the Pope's ministry, Nicolaus Speltus is an admirer of Hinata. With all that in consideration, it can be said that half of the Western Holy Church is firmly under Hinata's control.

The biggest player in both organizations around the Pope, Hinata, refuses to pledge herself to said Pope. Due to people such as Hinata, the relationship between the Western Holy Church and the Holy Empire of Lubelius appears severely twisted nowadays.

*What a difficult woman to deal with...*

Having summarized all that information, Laplace sighs with disdain.

The holy church is filled with the power of spirits, calling forth the grand holy-element spirits.

Such a strong aura of holiness greatly affected the majin Laplace. His senses seemed to have become reduced, and he felt the desire to retreat as soon as possible.

Laplace tried to encourage himself to move on while thinking over his next move.

He decided to head over to the top of the Spirit Mountain. It holds the "Inner Sanctum" which seems to be the place used for communicating with the Goddess.

While infiltrating the holy church, Laplace's instincts told him that there were some secrets hidden there.

"All right, what should I do next..."

Laplace considered what he should do for a moment and then headed towards the "Inner sanctum" across the holy church.

Laplace had been concerned about the amount of time spent investigating, since Hinata would be returning at any moment. But since she wasn't there yet, he needed to seize the opportunity to have a sneak peek at the teachings of the Western Church---The identity of their deity.

*I'll just take a look.*

He made up his mind and began to climb up the mountain roads.

However, that was a mistake.

Well, in terms of results it was the right decision as it provided incredibly valuable information, but at the same time, it put his life in jeopardy and gave him an unnecessary arduous task.

Using the narrow stone steps that led up the mountain, Laplace was able to reach the sanctum at its summit.

The sanctum was rather small compared to the Holy Church, yet the two were similar in terms of aesthetics. This small sanctum must have been the real residence of the God.

The surroundings were devoid of any sound.

The holy aura there was much more intense, and it pressed against Laplace's body and heart.

Yet there was a rather familiar magical aura he sensed in such a holy environment.

*---How could this be, Isn't this a holy land?! Why is there a presence of magicules? This is strange, it's really giving me the chills...*

The biggest obstacle, Hinata, was indeed not there.

And if there were any other people around (though he would not take them lightly either way) they would not be dangerous enough to pose a threat---Laplace reached such a conclusion.

But, was it really the right judgement?

With how things were developing, unease wormed its way into Laplace's heart as he doubted his decision.

*I'm overthinking it. I could just go in with full stealth and run away against any overbearing opponents.*

Laplace thought so to encourage himself and decided to give it a go.

He carefully enabled his "Deception Technique" and was about to go sneaking into the sanctum.

Yet in an instant---

He "seems" to have witnessed a light shining through his body. Immediately, the panicked Laplace made his rushed escape to the outside of the sanctum.

"Useless fool. A trash like you dares to profane the residence of 'God'."

An incredibly powerful person emerged from the sanctum.

Under his dashing clothes, Laplace could vaguely see a strong, muscular body.

The short, energetic blonde hair on his head displayed his temperament.

The style of a king.

The two canine teeth that jutted out of his mouth were the most eye-catching.

"How could this...A Vampire!"

"Silence, trash. I shall punish you myself. You should feel honored to be killed by my hands!"

What followed right after were strafes of red beams, all aimed at Laplace.

With nowhere to run and no plans of escape, Laplace was beaten to a pulp.

![full page image](image1)

.........

......

...

Laplace shivers as he recounts his experience.

"That guy sure was strong. I really thought I would die there."

"Or rather...why haven't you died yet?"

The young man teases upon hearing Laplace's mumbling.

Kazalim jests, astonished: "Meh, you probably can't kill this guy even if you wanted to."

"It's really annoying; shouldn't ensuring an escape route and one's own safety be common sense? But I feel as though I've been getting beat-downs all the time lately. So it's about time for me to act cool for once and show off what I am made of a little."

"Yeah, yeah. But your role is to be a spy, so I'd advise you to not try anything crazy."

"Yeah, Laplace. The goal is the important thing, playing cool is irrelevant, no?"

"Sure, you are both right. I'll just allow them to beat me more. I may even become a masochist one day."

"Why does that matter? It makes no difference if you lose."

"Yeah, just to live on and win at the last moment is enough. Speaking of which---"

Kazalim's expression becomes serious upon reaching this point in the conversation.

Laplace also nods in response:

"Yes, yes, the more important issue is that he was able to beat the crap out of me, meaning that guy is definitely strong. The question here is, who really is this guy? Logically, the question is how could such a strong majin appear in a holy place like that? That's definitely the breaking point. Could this revelation develop into an issue to shake the foundation of the Western Holy Church?"

"Majin... The Western Holy Church has connections with even majin, and on top of that, a high-ranking Vampire..."

Laplace, as if in sync with the other's thoughts, pushes towards the core issue.

The young man nods in agreement. However, he is unable to hide the shock on his face at such an unexpected turn of events.

"Now this may be an issue. The man who beat Laplace, according to my available knowledge, can't be just a simple majin."

"Indeed. I agree."

"Hmm, how so?"

The young man responds dubiously, despite what Kazalim and Laplace believe.

"I'm not trying to brag here, but I am strong. For instance, against that Dryad back then, had I fought her earnestly, she wouldn't have stood a chance. I just thought it was disadvantageous to fight in the forest, plus it would get real annoying real fast if she called for backup. That's why I decided to run. There wasn't really any point in fighting her. However, that guy was different. His strength could rival a demon lord. That's why running away was my only option."

In the forest, the Dryads are particularly powerful. Due to their racial attributes, they can teleport to anywhere within the forest instantaneously through the touch of any vegetation within their domain. Not only that, they are able to "share" all their information among members of their own race. That's why under such circumstances, their companions would surely come to her aid.

Dryads are a difficult race to deal with, and it's for this Laplace had decided to flee. If it were only one Dryad, Laplace would be confident in his victory.

However, it's different this time.

"That guy was a monster. Definitely stronger than me."

Laplace asserts with confidence.

The air in the room suddenly grows heavier.

"I see, a Demon Lord... Kazalim, what do you think?"

Kazalim sighs.

"As I said---we may be in trouble. To my knowledge, there's only one person that fits the description."

"Oh? And who would that be?"

The young man asks upon seeing that Kazalim is beating around the bush.

"---Demon Lord Valentine. One of the ancient demon lords whose strength rivaled mine when I was in my prime."

"Yeah, no wonder. If he can fight the president on even footing, fleeing was definitely the right call. I'm glad I followed my instincts."

Laplace shrugs as he responds.

He went through all the trouble of infiltrating the Church when Hinata was away yet encountering a demon lord?---His expression tells the whole story.

"...Hmm---The demon lord resides within the Western Holy Church. Could it be---that the Pope is in fact Demon Lord Valentine?"

"Who knows? It's strange that a demon lord would seek help from the humans. President, what is this Valentine guy like?"

Upon receiving the attention of both the young man and Laplace, Kazalim begins to recall the past.

He begins to knock his temple elegantly with his slim fingers, closing his eyes as he looks back on a series of events in the past.

"Despite how I look right now, I've survived three of the great wars that have plagued the lands every five hundred years. This certified me as one of the ancient demon lords. However, when I formally became a demon lord, there were already six others---"

Starting with that, Kazalim begins to tell the story.

Demon Lord Valentine himself has far more experience as a demon lord compared to Kazalim. With immense amounts of power, the title of King of the Undead Vampires is not a title just for show.

The Demon Lord Valentine, who himself is the symbol of the undead, has always alarmed Kazalim who had evolved from the long-living elven race to the undead race.

"---As a matter of fact, I've fought against Valentine several times. But never did it amount to anything. When beings like us start fighting, even if we ourselves remain unharmed, our surroundings sustain heavy damages. That's why we began sitting down and talking things over---this later developed into a system which decides on issues based on majority of votes---the Walpurgis Banquet. And the reason why any decision would be passed with three votes is a tradition inherited from the time where there were only seven demon lords."

Or perhaps it's because everyone was too lazy to change it---Kazalim laughs elegantly. Kazalim's voice fluctuates between masculine and feminine, and while it is creepy, the owner of said voice doesn't seem to notice.

Kazalim's smile gives way to a stern look as the story continues:

"I'd say, as someone who has fought against Valentine, he only ever sees humans and demi-humans as tools. There is absolutely no way that man would go and become a guardian of humanity."

Laplace nods in agreement.

The young man also begins to mull over Kazalim's words.

"Right, then should we make a deal with him?"

"Come on Laplace. Remember, a deal is something that all parties involved have to agree to."

"Oh yeah..."

Knowing that he is not equal to the other party, Laplace immediately banishes that thought.

"In addition, someone as stubborn as Hinata would never collaborate with a demon lord. Which means the Vampire Laplace encountered must have just been some insignificant majin instead of the real demon lord, right?"

The young man claims, seemingly in agreement with Laplace. However, Kazalim disagrees.

"No, I'm sure that was Valentine. I've heard of the swaths of red beams attack before, and there's no mistaking it. Valentine's title was 'Overlord of Fresh Blood', and he's specialized in the ability 'Blood Flash Shockwave,' which turns blood into beams of magical particles."

It is said that the "Blood Flash Shockwave" is a diffusing particle beam.

It turns one's blood into magical particles and thrusts it out as a violent barrage---The only person who has the magicule reserves to pull this off is, without a doubt, Demon Lord Valentine, concludes Kazalim.

If that's the case...

"In other words, the Vampire who Laplace fought is most definitely Demon Lord Valentine. However, he would never collaborate with humans. If that's true, the only conclusion we can draw is that the Pope must be Demon Lord Valentine, right?"

"It's possible...and the most logical conclusion to make. But it's still confusing as to how he's able to keep Hinata in the dark about all this."

Seeing the other two hum in agreement, Kazalim also expresses his own agreement.

"Indeed, that would be the most reasonable explanation. Although I still have my doubts, there are things that just don't add up... But right now our focus should be the location that Valentine resides, where only the Pope could enter."

He says as he lists out the facts obtained so far.

"Let me confirm this again, he is a real demon lord, right?"

"Most likely. His appearance is rather identical to my recollection. On top of that, Demon Lord Valentine's pride would never allow him to work for anyone but himself..."

"That's right, there aren't many majin who are stronger than I am. If that kind of monster exists in that place, any investigations in the future may very well be in jeopardy."

Since Kazalim and Laplace hold the same view, the young man also begins to accept the hypothesis that the Pope could very well be Demon Lord Valentine.

"Anyhow, this information is highly valuable. You've outdone yourself this time, Laplace."

The young man is definitely elated to have obtained such a trump card to bring down the Western Holy Church. He shows no sign of concern despite learning that the enemy is backed by a powerful demon lord.

Based on the newly obtained information, the young man now begins to plan out his next move. As such, he enjoys the scheming of the coming events...

![soft scene break]

"My report ends there. By the way, how are things progressing on Clayman's side?"

Laplace asks as he suddenly recalls that upon finishing his report.

The young man shows an annoyed expression of displeasure at the question. He brushes up his shining dark hair and replies with a complaining tone.

"Well about that...he messed up."

"Did he fail?"

"Yeah. It was all smooth sailing until we had Hinata duel that slime you mentioned. However, things somehow didn't go according to plan afterwards..."

The young man says as he begins to briefly explain the turn of events.

At the start, Clayman was successful in bringing Demon Lord Milim to his side thanks to the secret jewelry the young man gifted him---all thanks to the dominating orb's magic.

In order to examine its effectiveness, he'd have to confirm the extent of influence the orb had on Milim.

"And so we decided to have Milim fight an appropriately powerful individual to test out her strength. Demon lords are all cunning and unfathomably powerful beings, so we decided to use the least intelligent-looking Karion as the test subject."

Kazalim also joins the explanation after the young man.

"And to top it off, the capital of Eurazania could be taken down in the process. There are many ex-human slaves that reside there, and their souls could be used to awaken Clayman as a true demon lord."

As they say so, the young man and Kazalim looks at each other and sigh simultaneously.

"To use them for Clayman's awakening...talk about killing two birds with one stone."

"But then Milim went out of control and decided to give a war declaration by herself."

In the end, Karion and his men got an extra week to prepare themselves, which allowed the people residing within the capital to seek refuge elsewhere.

"As expected, manipulating demon lords with magic items is no simple task. We need to make sure to give more detailed commands next time before we try anything else."

"You gotta have a bit of faith in me. I'm exceptionally good with mind manipulation magic, you know! My title 'Cursed King' isn't just for show. I made that domination orb myself; it is an incredible piece of magical equipment. The only reason our plan got messed up is because of that incompetent bastard Clayman."

"It's all water under the bridge at this point now. Anyway, the soul collection plan at Beast Kingdom failed so we set our sights on the Kingdom of Farmus."

"The Kingdom of Farmus?"

"Yeah, that country where they performed the summoning rituals in-house and gathered a number of Otherworlders. And because of that, I thought it was about time to reduce their influence a bit. I secretly found someone to leak some information regarding the Monster Kingdom and caught the interest of that greedy king and his subordinates."

"And given how greedy they are, they took the bait really hard."

The original plan of creating a new demon lord out of the Orc Lord failed spectacularly, so based on Laplace's report they decided on another plan---Instigate the Kingdom of Farmus to invade the Jura-Tempest Federation.

That Kingdom has several high level majin and we get to have them kill each other against those Otherworlders from Farmus.

It just so perfectly happens that Rimuru, the leader of that nation, was acting alone outside his country when Clayman's subordinate infiltrated it.

Rimuru was the ideal bait to draw Hinata out for a fight; the plan is truly killing two birds with one stone. However---

"But to our surprise, that slime named Rimuru was able to escape from Hinata! This is one slime that we absolutely cannot afford to overlook, just like you."

"That's a rather sharp jab..."

"There's even worse things to come---"

"In my opinion, Farmus's victory was all but guaranteed. However, once the leader of the monsters gets involved, the situation may very well be turned. But honestly, it makes little difference as to who wins. We would just have to negotiate with the side that wins. The real objective is to cause enough casualties---and gather souls. And I had thought we'd use those souls to help awaken our cute little Clayman, but..."

It was a complete failure.

The grand army of Farmus was completely decimated by a single slime.

"Unbelievable right, but it's the truth."

"It's the first time for me to have my plans derailed like this, even with my Unique Skill 'Planner'."

The young man is very disappointed and Kazalim looks quite upset about it as well.

"H-hold on! Taken out by a single monster, how is that even possible? Did Farmus really underestimate the Monster Kingdom that much?!"

Laplace shouts in surprise upon hearing such preposterous claims, to which Kazalim made the following response.

"As I mentioned, the Kingdom of Farmus was rather interested. It prepared a huge army of twenty-thousand soldiers consisting of knights and mages. Yet the entire legion was eliminated. As I said, there were no survivors."

"Ehhhh! That's just madness..."

Laplace was completely baffled to discover this series of bizarre events. However, more surprising new information awaits.

"What's more, according to Clayman's post-war reconnaissance of the battlefield, he claims that all the corpses have disappeared. It means that someone has used those corpses as a sacrifice to summon, or create some sort of monster..."

"If I could use all those corpses to create a magic golem, god knows how powerful of a monster could be created? On top of that, those aren't your run of the mill normal corpses; they're all highly trained soldiers. The negative emotions on the battlefield have also created the perfect environment for casting this type of magic. With all of these conditions combined, one can expect to summon monsters that can at least rival a demon lord."

"Is it even possible? The way I see it, it's our loss that we couldn't retrieve the souls. According to Clayman, he couldn't even acquire a single soul at the scene, so his awakening plan is once again in shambles."

Says the young man as he lets out a sigh.

The young man laments his losses and reflects that the reason for all of this failure was because he has been operating on too many fronts.

Over-emphasizing efficiency and neglecting each individual strategy, that's why they've been failing at every step along the way.

Perhaps I am being too greedy---thought the young man.

"Could it be that the slime named Rimuru was the one that harvested all those souls?"

"What nonsense are you suggesting, Laplace? That's a feat beyond even a demon lord, so how could a single majin manage that?"

Kazalim is right.

The collection of 20000 souls as well controlling them would be a difficult task even for someone skilled in the art of magic. If one is to proceed without considering their own limitations, it will no doubt result in losing control of the souls.

Besides, if someone did pull that off successfully---

"Hahaha, yeah right, Laplace. If this guy takes twenty-thousand souls in one sitting then he's probably evolved into a monster by now, right?"

The young man smirks at the possibility.

"I suppose you're correct. I might be overthinking this a bit too much, having so many bad thoughts running around in my head."

Laplace's doubts are ridiculed by the other two believing it to be an unfathomable idea.

The conditions necessary to awaken as a True demon lord---That's something even Kazalim doesn't know in its entirety. If anything, it would probably require an insane number of souls.

In order to confirm such a hypothesis, they'd decided to use Clayman as a lab rat. Clayman also attempted to experiment using the Orc Lord. However, all of these plans have since, to their annoyance, failed.

Under such circumstances, even someone as calculated as Kazalim could not have expected a slime of all things to out of nowhere evolve into a "True Demon Lord".

But Laplace's guess has been right all along, it's just that the three have yet to discover it.

"Speaking of which, what's Clayman been up to lately...?"

Having infiltrated the Western Church and almost dying in the process, Laplace thought that Clayman would probably understand his hardship. His eyes drift off as he asked dubiously.

"He's currently on standby. As it stands right now, it's better to be acting cautiously. But thanks to Milim doing what she said she would, the Beast Kingdom has now been turned to dust. For now, we'll slow down our pace and reassess our future strategies."

"Oh? So not all of our plans have ended in complete failure?"

"Oi oi, are you mocking me, Laplace? Even with most of my power lost, strategizing is still my specialty."

"That's right. I'll be really angry if all my plans just went awry like this! Despite the many setbacks to our plans, we are, at least, still successful in weakening the Farmus Kingdom. Consequently, the Western Nations will be more unified from now on, making it easier for us to control."

"And the Jura Forest can act as a defense against invasions from the Eastern Empire."

"I see. So president, if we are going to negotiate with the winning forces, then there's no need to destroy the Monster Kingdom."

Laplace fully agrees with the two.

Plans that change according to the circumstances to ensure that they are always profitable---These are the abilities possessed by Kazalim's Unique Skill 'Planner'. Laplace recalls this and praises it in heart "He sure has his way."

"Milim defeated Karion, which proves the domination orb is indeed effective. Our display of power should stop here, and we should wait to see how the other demon lords react."

"Right. That's why we've ordered Clayman to be on standby. The Eastern Empire is going to take action anyways, so there will be more chances for him to collect souls."

"Additionally, the Western Holy Church is also onto the Monster Kingdom, so keeping that country around should make things more convenient for us."

So that's why you two are saying there's no need to rush... Laplace realizes.

"Which means, our enemy at the moment is just the Western Holy Church?"

"That would be it for the time being."

"However, things aren't as simple as that. We must assume the enemy forces consist of both saints and demon lords, so it would be too dangerous to act without exercising caution."

They don't want to have a direct confrontation with the Church as they want to avoid disputes with the various other forces. Laplace asks if that is the current plan, to which the young man nods in agreement.

The Monster Kingdom will no doubt become an obstacle after they seize control of the Western Nations.

Apart from that, there is another reason.

They must reflect and take to heart the reasons of their continued failure. Next time, they must carefully assess their enemies and avoid taking a double-front approach.

The Western Holy Church and the Holy Empire of Lubelius behind it. These are the high priority enemies that they need to strike down first. This time, they need to be cautious and avoid leaving traces...

This is why it's rather convenient to have the Monster Kingdom around for the time being. By exploiting the Western Holy Church's doctrines, they can have the attention of people such as Hinata since she will focus on the monsters.

"The Church definitely won't ignore a majin like Rimuru. After the defeat of the Kingdom of Farmus , it's unlikely that they could convince the rest of the Western Nations to wage a holy crusade. But in order to avoid the loss of faith, they will definitely need to make a move."

"Indeed. If we are able to intervene somehow and instigate the two parties, they may kill each other off. We just need to wait for both sides' strength to decline."

Says the young man with an evil grin.

That majin alone annihilated 20,000 trained soldiers by himself. No one could deal with him except for Hinata. The young man must have concocted many plans waiting for this moment.

The arrangement of plans seems to be done. There is not a single sound of hesitation in the young man's voice as he explains them to Laplace.

"But the things you reported are beyond our planning, Laplace."

"Yeah. I can't believe that the Demon Lord Valentine came to mess things up. Could they actually be collaborating? Knowing Hinata's personality, she would never collaborate with a demon lord."

Both the young man and Kazalim note with a hint of anger. The tone itself is almost like saying that it would be much easier to deal with the Western Church if Demon Lord Valentine were never involved.

*It's not like it's my fault.* Laplace feels rather embarrassed as he tries to find an excuse for himself:

"I know. How about we draw out the demon lord to remove him from obstructing our investigation?"

"Hmm? What do you mean, Laplace?"

"Think about it, we only need to mention it to Clayman and tell him to convene the Banquet. Right now the Demon Lord Frey is on his side and so is Milim. Three demon lords should be enough to initiate a meeting."

The Walpurgis Banquet---As long as the meeting is being held, all the demon lords will be drawn to show up.

"---I see. In this way we'll be able to draw Demon Lord Valentine out of Lubelius."

The young man nodded with a smile, having accepted Laplace's proposal.

"Oh, it's rather rare for Laplace to act smart for once. Trying to find an opportunity to lure Hinata out of the holy lands again so your investigation can proceed."

"Huh?! Why me again?"

"It's only natural."

"You don't say?"

*Come on, seriously?* Laplace thought to himself.

But neither the young man nor Kazalim seem to care.

As such, without Laplace's consensus, the majins begin to draft a new plan.
