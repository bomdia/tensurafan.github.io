# Chapter 6: The Octagram

As soon as I finish consuming Clayman, the red-haired demon lord stands up from his seat.

He then begins to speak with much majesty.

"Nicely done. I will approve you to use the title of demon lord in the future. Any objection?"

There doesn't seem to be any objection. It looks like they've all recognized me as a demon lord now. Now I can be reassured.

Honestly, it would be a suicidal act to try taking the hostile stance against the rest of the demon lords around here.

However, those concerns seem to be unnecessary.

I disengaged from the battlefield and Ramiris approaches by flying to talk to me.

"I knew Rimuru could do it when he gets serious! That's why I told you, I'll allow you to study under me in the future."

"Huh, I'll pass, you can find student somewhere else."

"Why? Why does it matter? Just be my student (underling), pretty please."

Ramiris starts to complain.

Meanwhile, Milim responds to her proudly:

"Fufu! Rimuru is my besties. He doesn't seem willing to get along with you now!"

"Ehh? You must be kidding, Oi! Rimuru, that isn't true, right?"

"WHAHAHA! You've been elbowed out by me, Ramiris!"

"What did you just say! Then check this out!"

Milim's deliberate provoke was successful, leading Ramiris to throw a flying kick to Milim's face.

Milim laughs delightfully as she casually dodges the kick.

The two seem surprisingly close.

On the other hand---

Without my notice, Veldora began to chat to Demon Lord Dagruel intimately.

He seems to be showing off by discussing about his current training of surpassing aura.

He even points at me while saying "You see that, Dagruel? That's the best example.", looking all smug.

Dagruel replies "Indeed. It was only for a short while, but I felt it dearly. The burst of magicule is impactful. Yet he concealed it so perfectly.", as such, in agreement with Dagruel.

Veldora seemed to have acted as the live commentator for me during my battle against Clayman.

Please stop doing this and spare me the trouble. It is because I know you would have done such things that I wanted you to stay at home...

Dino seems to have lost interest once the battle was over and says dizzily:

"Oh well, that's cool I guess."

He simply throws out a line like that.

This demon lord is quite hard to see through and I have no idea what's on his mind. But at least he seems to recognize me as well, that should do.

Leon on the other hand acts as if it is none of his business.

"Huh, I'm not interested in whoever becomes demon lord. You guys can do whatever you want."

What a cold guy.

Frey and Karion don't seem object either.

Which means, there's only one person left...

At that moment, the previously silent Demon Lord Valentine takes a heavy step forward.

"Huh, a lowly slime wants to be demon lord. I would never agree to that---"

Valentine looks down to me with arrogance and said so to me in a glaring tone like an emperor.

It seems he's voted against me. However, by the system of majority votes, I'm positive that most of the demon lords here have approved of me.

Then there won't be a problem---I thought so and decide to ignore him.

"Ga---HAHAHA. Silly brat, how dare you insult my friend? Oi, Milus^[Veldora remembers her name wrongly, it's Luminas if you are not informed.], your underling is quite rude to his superior, should I teach him a lesson for you?"

Veldora said so to Valentine's maid without hesitation.

Eh, OI! What are you doing, mister??

"What do you mean by that? I'm just a loyal maid to Demon Lord Valentine-sama."

Her voice is cold, cold as her expression---as Milus responds to Veldora.

"Hey, you can't do that! Valentine's been hiding her true identity, Veldora, you shouldn't expose other people like that!"

Eh, Milim-san? Aren't you the one who's exposing other people?

I was already skeptical about it before and it would seem my guess was correct.

The beautiful girl wearing maid suit, Milus, is the real demon lord.

Her sights alone now could kill. That is the type of stare Milus is giving Milim right now.

"Ahh!"

Milim seems to have realized and begins to awkwardly whisper, trying to muddle through.

![exact fit image](image14)

You aren't even whispering out any sounds. Plus, it's no use for you to do something like that now. Milus doesn't seem to be the joking type, you probably can't have her forgive you after doing something like that.

Milus menacingly glares around her surroundings.

Her eyes tell that she wishes to kill everyone present to dispose of the witnesses.

She seems like the aggressive and dangerous type. But luckily Milus decides to give up the idea so as to not make her a public enemy here.

"Gee, you blasted evil dragon, ruining my^[Luminas is using "" which is how noble usually address themselves. Same for Roy Valentine] work every single time... Also, did you even forget my real name? You sure are irritating."

Milus---no, Demon Lord Valentine says so with her intimidating aura unleashed.

Veldora sure is casual, even remembering other people's name wrong. That probably have provoked Valentine even more.

"Enough. You may call me Valentine."

Valentine announces so with much displeasure.

Immediately after, she releases an immense amount of magic and changes her appearance instantly. Her maid suit disappears, and instead it was replaced with a luxurious black gothic dress.

That's magical dress change---The quick clothes change magic that Milim is also good at.

And a girl with heavenly beauty appears before us.

Ah, of course. The real deal is indeed different.

The male Valentine is rather strong too, but the difference between the two is heaven and earth. The demon lord with both beauty and power thus enters the scene.

"Roy, you can go back first."

Valentine displays the style of a king and orders the current Demon Lord Valentine after her dress change. It would seem that the Demon Lord valentine here is called Roy.

"But, Valentine-sama---"

"There's no point in keep acting now after we've been exposed in front of so many people."

Valentine asserts so while staring at Veldora. Veldora is looking all awkward and mumbling "It's not my fault, none of my business..."and tries to avoid eye contact with Valentine. These are barely excuses.

And the one who started all this, Milim, has it out of her mind completely now. To Milim, that's likely just a past event. Her habit of doing whatever she wants really can't be changed.

But she probably knows better than anyone that Valentine, apart from her rage, has no intention to extend her complaints any further.

Now she's changed her mood and gave some strict orders to Roy, who now is simply an underling:

"Besides, there's something on my mind right now. That guy Clayman has laid eyes on you, and his vision was frozen for a second. This may have something to do with the pest that invaded our territory. Go back and inform everyone to stay on guard."

She says so.

According to her, it would seem then Clayman has been meddling in other people's business all this time. No wonder he is disliked so much.

Perhaps he's just trying to find out more about the unknown domain of Valentine, what a reckless guy. Such love for information collecting is playing with fire.

"---Understood."

After his response, Roy leaves alone to return to his country.

He didn't disobey Valentine's order. This means that Roy has little reluctance for the seat of demon lord and was indeed just a body-double.

This also shows the authority wielded by the real Valentine.

As such, Valentine returns to her demon lord throne once more.

![soft scene break]

Now let's restore everything to normal.

I take out the round table from "Stomach" and place it properly.

It was the right call to absorb it to protect it from breaking. If we had broken out fighting without such preparation in the fighting area, it would definitely damage the table. It looks quite expensive, so I have no intention to compensate for breaking it.

The demon lords return to the round table while the two maids working for Guy begin to serve everyone with black tea.

Leon, slanting his eyes at the scene suddenly speaks:

"...Ah, now I recall. The name Kazalim sounds awfully familiar. It was the demon lord that I killed."

I almost spit out the black tea I just drank.

How could Leon just suddenly say that in monotone without a single bit of emotion?!

"Do you know him, Leon?"

How come YOU don't know about him, Milim-san?

The rest of the demon lords have a similar reaction to hers.

Who's that supposed to be? The majority think so.

Even Ramiris has completely forgotten about him. Don't you have any memory to those things? I want to tease her about that, but I digress out of pity.

---So where did the name Kazalim come from?

<<...Answer. Clayman just called out to a number of people. One of the names was "Kazalim".>>

Oh yeah! Now I recall.

Which other name did he call out now... Just to clarify, I remember everything very clearly, please don't treat me as the likes of Milim and Ramiris.

"So what would be the relationship between this Kazalim and Clayman?"

I attempted to ask and got an answer from Karion.

"Kazalim was the 'Cursed King'. Milim, didn't you and Kazalim recommend me to become a demon lord?"

"Oh, it's that guy. I remember there was a 'Cursed King'. Right, he's the demon lord that Leon killed.".

She can't remember the name but still recalls the title. That's somewhat acceptable, I guess.

So that's the only Demon Lord Leon has beaten. But in my view, she must have forgotten because it is unimportant...

"Yeah, I remember Kazalim was an Undead Elf^[妖死族 デスマン (Death man) - SInce it's explained that it's a type of undead evolved from elves I would translate it to undead elf. (more information on the race in volume 10)] just like Clayman. And it's the mutated species of elves that evolved through their own efforts. I used to have some connection with him in private and heard that Clayman took over Kazalim's territory. From that we can infer the two are connected secretly."

Karion reminiscent of the past and turns to tell me that. It seems Karion thinks Kazalim is not as bad as Clayman.

Wow, right, wait a second? I almost skipped through that, but since Kazalim is also undead elf...

"Could it be that Kazalim is still alive? Did he pretend to be killed by Leon and in reality, have hidden himself somewhere else?"

"Hmm, that guy is capable of that indeed. Kazalim, he's a much more difficult guy to deal with than Clayman. He is a smart man."

Karion agrees to my view, so I think it's likely the case.

"You say it as if I had intentionally let him slip. Unbelievable. He used to proclaim so arrogantly that he will assist me to become a demon lord one day as long as I serve under his reign. I didn't even bother to refuse and simply took his place by defeating. Whether he's dead or alive now is none of my concern."

Leon says so without any shame.

I suppose Leon just wanted to show his strength instead of actually killing Kazalim. That's why he doesn't care about his status now.

"Oi oi oi, Leon. It must be because this kind of attitude of yours that Clayman hated you so much."

"Huh, I'm not interested."

Karion decides to advise Leon but was met with a cold answer. But it probably would only trouble Leon more.

Speaking of which, I didn't know Clayman was working against Leon as well, he sure had a lot of enemies. Is he really a smart guy? I become more and more skeptical.

But if that's the case, I seem to have a rough idea of what Kazalim and Clayman's plan is.

I heard that it's been around two hundred years since Leon become a demon lord, and apart from helping Karion and Clayman becoming demon lord, Kazalim likely wanted to have more companions within the demon lord rank.

It is probably for that reason that Clayman carried out the plan to turn orc lord into a demon lord. It is to have more people to help out and have more of a presence during the Banquet.

This type of idea of creating big group of comrade seems to be quite scummy and isn't appropriate for a demon lord.

But it is indeed an effective plan, so I could understand.

"Among Clayman's companions, there is an organization called 'The Moderate Clown Troupe'. They seem to receive assistance from humans and it's likely the revived Kazalim has possessed onto some human."

I begin to explain my theory.

Having been defeated by Leon, Kazalim's body seemed to have been destroyed. This is why in order to revive himself, it must start with his astral body.

If that was the case, he would naturally want to possess onto other living being.

Besides, if he had revived in the resident area of other demon lords, he would have been discovered immediately. Kazalim, who has yet to be discovered till this day, must have hid somewhere other than the domains of demon lord.

"Maybe that's the case. Leon's attack could even destroy spiritual body. It's rather commendable that Kazalim was even able to figure out a way to survive. Moreover, it would take several hundred years' time for even us, the Demon race, to revive from our soul form. It's definitely worse for Undead Elf. So it's unlikely that he was able to revive himself with his own strength."

Guy surprisingly agrees to my view.

Unlike spiritual life form such as Demon race, the Undead relies on flesh. This is why the revival of his astral body requires a lot of time. It's a miracle that he was even able to survive.

That is Guy's explanation summarized.

In other words, it's highly possible that someone has been assisting him.

But there isn't any reliable source of information regarding these connections behind the scene.

"Anyhow, we'll leave it like this for now. Regardless, we must assume now that Kazalim has been revived. Stay on alert. Clayman has been killed, so I would think he will probably hate me a lot."

"WHAHAHAHA! Rimuru, you are quite strong, so don't worry about it!"

"Idiot! Don't you know you will get defeated for being so careless?!"

Milim suddenly replies as I spoke.

In a way I responded so to serve as a reminder for myself.

Our grand victory today wiped out all of Clayman's forces, so I'd think the enemies won't take any action any time soon. But I can't get careless now. It's fine if they go after me alone, but right now I have companions to take care of.

I need to put more thoughts into defense in the future and draft some response strategies.

![soft scene break]

The short break ended with the meeting once again held.

Clayman who was previously the host of meeting has now been forcefully retired. So Guy took his place and host the meeting.

"Our topic of discussion today is the betrayal of Karion and the rise of the Rimuru guy over there. And all these issues have been resolved. Karion never betrayed us and Rimuru has shown power worthy of the role of demon lord. I think the meeting is done so far. But since it's a rather rare occasion, does anyone have any suggestion to make?"

Frey begins to speak, seemingly awaiting that line.

"Could you allow me to speak for a moment? Right now we are during the middle of our meeting, so I have a suggestion to make, or rather, a request to make, I suppose."

"Fair enough, have at you."

Seeing Guy has approved, Frey nods and proceeds:

"From today onward, I've decided to follow Milim's rule. Based on that, I would like to give out my seat as a demon lord."

Such it's the big shocker she just tossed out.

"Oi oi oi, why are you saying this all of a sudden?"

"Wait, Frey! How come I never heard you mention about this?"

"Indeed, I've kept silent. But I've been thinking about it for some time now."

Frey squeezes her eyes and drifts afar as she speaks.

![hard scene break]

Frey recalls to herself.

She was talking to Milim then. Their conversation made Frey determine to have faith in Milim.

"Let me ask you this, Frey. Would you like to be my friend?"

"---Why do you ask that?"

"Because I made a friend like Rimuru! Friends are really amazing; they help each other out all the time."

"Well now, is that so? About that, Milim... If you are willing to help me, I would like to be your friend then."

"Really! Then I will definitely agree to you."

"Haha, that's pleasing. However, I am rather cautious. So if you are willing to follow a "promise", then I'll trust you."

"All right I know! Then we can be friends together!"

Frey doesn't trust Clayman, that's why she chose to believe Milim. She gets to keep herself safe while pretending to have accepted Clayman's advice.

If Milim didn't follow the promise, had she actually been manipulated...

Although she feels unease, Frey decided to gamble on Milim.

And so in the end, it was her victory.

That is the reason.

The reason why Frey decides to put her faith in Milim and follow her.

This lone and arrogant Queen has not trusted anyone before, and this is the first time she entrusts herself to any individual.

![hard scene break]

Frey seems to have recalled something and had a chuckle about it. Then, she announces with determination:

"Anyhow, there's a lot of reasons for why. But the most important one of them is that I feel like I am too weak to be a demon lord. After witnessing that battle just now, I was further convinced. If I am to fight against Clayman, I could barely manage to make it a draw in the end. Not to add that Clayman became awakened mid-fight, so there's no way I could have won..."

"But Frey, aren't you good at high-speed aerial combat? Is there really a need to look down on yourself like that?"

Dagruel tries to defend her, but Frey seems already determined.

"Indeed, I'm more advantageous in aerial combat. But that's no excuse for not being a demon lord. Moreover, I know it's not enough to just have some advantages---"

Upon saying so, Frey peeks at me.

![soft scene break]

Then she proceeds with the words.

"---So, that's why I decided to work under Milim. Besides, Milim can't always act so stubborn, right? She needs to learn how to run her own territory now, shouldn't she?"

That means Frey isn't saying so just for her own sake.

Milim is indeed a dangerous individual that can't be let loose on her own. There needs to be someone who can assist her and watch over her.

Frey understands her short-coming. But in my view, she's not as weak as she describes. It can be said that she is a different type of strategist from Clayman, one whose ideas can't be seen through. It's quite terrifying when you think about it.

In anyhow, she is the typical type of person that let you go "women are terrifying". I suppose that's why I feel she's particularly scary.

But what would really happen if that's the case (Frey serving Milim)?

If she is no longer a demon lord but proceeds as a servant. Her combat ability is undoubtedly worthy of Milim.

There is no recognized nation under Milim's name, but would she now possess territory once Frey becomes her subordinate?

When the time comes for me to build an alliance with Milim's country, the engagement may be complicated with Frey's involvement.

Or rather, it would be more interesting that way.

"So, do you accept my proposition?"

Frey looks towards Milim as she continues her speech.

"B-but I don't give out visas..."

Milim doesn't know what to do.

But as she attempts to reject the proposition---

"Hold your horses. I've got something to say about this as well."

With such statement, Karion joins in their conversation, "I, too, has lost to Milim during a duel. I think life is all about being straightforward, so I want to surrender to her. In terms of our titles, the demon lords have the same place. It's a different case when fighting against a Chosen Hero, but now I've lost to another demon lord, so I ought to step down. Which means there's no excuse for me to keep being a demon lord. That's why now I'll be Milim's subordinate from now on. Please take care of me, BOSS!"

This one just decides to straight up ignore her personal will.

I understand that power is everything to all the demon lords, but this is just...

Milim doesn't take any subordinate and so she won't get objection from them. But now suddenly two current demon lords fall under her reign, how does that even make any sense?

"Wait a second, Karion! The duel thing was all Clayman's doing! I was manipulated, I've got nothing to do with that!"

That's just quibble.

I don't think excuse like that would work, Milim.

The other demon lords are also looking at her, dumbfounded.

"Hey now, stop lying. You did just say "It's impossible to manipulate me!", and you said it so confidently!"

Karion's impersonation is really on point and was able to reenact Milim's words. I'm surprised he turns out to be so talented.

"Hm? T-that, that was..."

"It's okay, don't mind that idiot who's all brawn and no brain, you will take me in right, Milim?"

"Y-you are saying that hoping to trick me, right? Becoming my minister or underling, and you won't talk to me like an equal again, right? And you won't play with me or do pranks with me either."

Frey shakes her head hearing Milim's words.

"That's not true. We get to be together forever in that way. And we get to do more fun things together."

She begins to brainwash Milim with such things---Trying to instigate her.

You see, it's this type of things that makes you cautious around her.

As for Karion, he does have a strong personal style and cuts to the trace:

"Bottom line is, it's all because you've trashed my kingdom to shreds! Rimuru-san promised to help us, but you'd also have the duty to take care of us."

I don't think that type of duty exists, but Milim seems to be clueless against this type of logic.

Karion, is surprisingly witty.

Milim seems to have taken Karion's words for it and almost fainted. But then she bursts out as if she doesn't want to care about any of this anymore.

"So ANNOYING! All right, all right, whatever you guys want!"

Smoke begins to flow out from Milim's head like the eruption of a volcano. Milim.exe has stopped working.

Sasuga Milim.

She seems smart but never actually uses her brain.

"Karion, do you really wish to do that?"

"Of course. I've thought through a lot already. I don't intend to retire from being the king of the beast kingdom. I merely wish to pursue Milim and build up a new system."

Karion gave a simple and clear answer to Guy's question.

"I was rather fond of you. Perhaps you'll also awake given another couple hundred years and I was looking forward to it."

Guy sighs through his nose and says so with disappointment.

But he immediately switches to a smile and announces.

"Very well! From now on, Frey and Karion are no longer demon lords. You two can go server Milim as you desire."

With Guy's words out, the two are officially released from the duty of demon lord.

No one present seem to object.

And of course, I'm none the wiser.

And so, I've officially been approved and inaugurated as demon lord. I eliminated another one alongside with the retirement of two other, who decided to be Milim's subordinates.

The Ten Great Demon Lords are now Eight Great Demon Lords.

![soft scene break]

And just as I thought the meeting is over, there seems to be another issue to resolve in the end.

I said it without much care and started the whole ordeal.

"Oh yeah, so it's not Ten Great Demon Lords anymore."

This quickly sparked responses from all the demon lords.

"That's quite annoying indeed. It's a matter of prestige, so we've got to come up with a new title."

Dagruel says so.

Eh? Is it really that important?

"Glad that the banquet has yet to be dismissed. Now that all the demon lords are gathered, we may come up with some good ideas."

Even Valentine who doesn't take jokes lightly begins to follow with a serious expression.

Oi oi oi, we don't need to be that cautious with something like titles.

Even if we let it slide, the humans will definitely make up names for us by themselves.

"We've gone drained our brain doing this last time. Every time we decide to change our name the number of members just keep fluctuating. And then several banquets just pass with no result---"

Ehhhh! Did you guys seriously hold the Banquet just for some boring trivia like that?

I recall Ramiris was being exaggerated when she mentioned that the banquet is a special meeting that all demon lords must attend...that doesn't seem right or is it just simply a tea party in the beginning.

I feel whatever changes would be okay.

"Yeah, like the last title 'Ten Great Demon Lords' was in the end how the humans call us. We wasted so much brain cells just trying to come up with a name. So leave me out of this one, I've got no more strength to spare---"

No no no, whether you can do it is a different thing. You are just too lazy to think at all. So stop saying that as if you've gone through much serious contemplations.

"Quiet, people. All you've been doing is complaining. There isn't anything constructive at all!"

"What do you mean by that Valentine. You sure talk the talk when you push all the work to Roy."

Valentines says so which resonates with me, yet it was countered with a single line from Dino. Unlike Milim or Ramiris, this lazy bone here has sharp words.

But why would it cost so much time just trying to come up with a name. Or rather, they seem all so pumped up by it, could the demon lords be really bored in life?

After asking around I learnt that it took them several years to settle for a name last time. But as they were halfway through, the humans began to call them "Ten Great Demon Lords". Thus, the demon lords in favor of naming drastically decrease. As long as they can come up with a good name, they seem to be fine with moderating the number of demon lords.

And so they decided to use the title officially, but not everyone was fine with how it sounded.

That's one nonchalant info.

"You guys need to calm down now. It is time like this we need to show some comradery to sail through difficult times together, unlike how we usually behave."

Guy was straight to the point about their lack of unity in most days.

Ramiris begins to mumble to herself hearing Guy's word.

"Eh, but... This time is, Eight Great---"

Even though she says so, her mumbling dies down under the immense silent pressure exerted by the rest of the crowd.

She then restarted with something else: "Ah yes. What a great speech by Guy! Let's work hard together now!"

Everyone seems to be against the title Eight Great Demon Lords.

But this is not a symbol of unity.

"WHAHAHA! I'll leave this task to you!"

"I'm tired, time for bed."

It didn't take long before the unfitting bunch starts to appear one by one.

But I should have guessed that, they are indeed demon lords.

I'd say it would be an impossible mission to unite them all, and my guess was right.

However, someone suddenly appeared to break this awkward atmosphere.

This brainlet of a man now stands right behind me.

"Oh? If that's the issue, my friend Rimuru is pretty good at it!"

It's Veldora.

Veldora who has started to feel bored and wanted to go back soon, said this out of nowhere.

OH NOO, the demon lords' eyes now have all fixated on me.

Why don't you go read you damn manga instead of spilling nonsense here. But, could it be that he has finished all his manga? Even the last volume?

Milim has her eyes locked on Veldora, no, Veldora's mangas in his hands. Those eyes are sharper than those of eagles' when locking on prey, causing me to feel a lot of unease.

But it's not the time to worry about that.

Someone agreeing with Veldora appears.

It's Ramiris.

"Speaking of that, he also named my Beretta super-fast!"

Now she's tossed me the hot potato with all that nonsense.

This girl... She's getting more and more casual with me. It vaguely reflects a sense of dependence she's growing towards me.

While I turn unconsciously, the rest of the demon lords are also looking at me with expectation.

This is bad. I've been surrounded!

The demon lords exchange looks, and Guy stands up to speak in everyone's name.

"Rimuru, the newly risen demon lord, today I shall grant you an epic special privilege."

"Ah, no thanks. I don't need that."

I attempt to cut him up as soon as possible. However, my imaginations were too naive.

Chong-dong! As I hear the loud noise, the giant round table that reflects with textures of obsidian and looks quite expensive is now severed in half with by someone.

Guy ignores my rejection with a smile and continues:

"Of course you need it, the privilege to create a new title for us. This is of great honor, you must really want to accept it, right?"

He walks towards me casually and proclaims to me and fondles my cheek.

Is this some sort of flighty display to ask for a favor?

Although he looks gentle like water, his tone sounds irrefusable.

I am speechless. Neither could I accept, nor could I reject, so I decide to exercise my rights to remain silence, however...

Guy starts to push against my cheek hard with his fingers, while biting my ears and whispers: "By the way, aren't you the way causing our layoffs of members today? You will take responsibility and help think up a name now, won't you?"

It may seem to the rest is some lover wanting to get spoiled, but it's not the case at all.

This is a threat!

Alas, I couldn't refuse anyway considering how everything went.

I can't believe how troublesome this has become.

Never mind.

"All right, all right. Gosh. Then don't complain later that you don't like the name I make."

I took the task with much unwillingness after giving up struggling.

The demon lords are all with smiling faces as if saying "That's great, now we are reassured."

Some people even ask for more tea and decide to rest from then on. They always like to push their work to other people.

Fine then, I won't care about them either.

We are eight demon lords in total, so Eight Great Demon Lord is okay... But it seems a bit too straight forward.

Whatever Ramiris was just about to say is probably Eight Great Demon Lords, so I'd refrain from using that. After all, you could feel the immense pressure emitted from the rest of the group, telling her to stop. I definitely won't make it now if I get those threatening stares.

So "Eight Great Demon Lords" is a no go.

Then...

Speaking of which, tonight is the new moon.

The shining stars in the night sky are very pretty---

"Hey, how about the Octagram? You know, like an eight-pointed star?"

It was greeted by silence, the demon lords closing their eyes and scrutinizing the word. Then they all reopened them in unison.

"That would be it, it sounds very nice."

"We can definitely win with this name! A new age has arrived!"

"That's right! I know Rimuru could do it!"

"You sure know your stuff. As expected from candidate nominated by Veldora."

"Oh, sounds all right. Then I shall agree with you a little."

"You got it in an instance! That's pretty cool. I don't know why we wasted so much time on this last time."

"...Hmm *~~Dino Approval Sound~~*."

There doesn't seem to be any objection.

That's great. And if anyone would like to object, I'll have him think of a name.

Although I don't know who Milim is trying to compete with or win. It's a bit concerning but I won't go after it.

Also Dino, I want to ask you what the blaze were you all discussing before...

Some of the people here's reaction raises a lot of question for me, but I manage to play dumb like an adult to make it through.

Just like that---

From the moment onward, the demon lords introduce themselves with a new title to be respected by the world.

![soft scene break]

We were called the Octagram:

![break]

Demon --- "Lord of Darkness" Guy Crimson

Dragonoid --- "Destroyer" Milim Nava

Fairy --- "Fairy of Labyrinth" Ramiris^[Katakana of title is "Labyrinth"]

Titan --- "Continent's Wrath" Dagruel^[Katakana of title is "Earthquake"]

Vampire --- "Queen of Nightmares" Valentine

Fallen Angel --- "Sleeping Ruler" Dino

Ex-Human --- "Platinum Saber" Leon Cromwell

...and me:

Monster --- "Newbie" Rimuru Tempest

---In total, eight members as mentioned above.

From today onward, the new age of demon lords has arrived.

But first, we need to divide territory.

My domain would be the entirety of Jura Great Forest.

That's a nice treatment.

But, Milim got it better.

The combined territory of Frey, Karion and Clayman is now under Milim's control.

But she only rules it in name.

The inner work of the territory would be run by Karion, Frey and the Worshippers of Dragon who follow Milim.

In addition, the previous territory belonged to Clayman now falls in the buffer zone with the territory of eastern empire. They must investigate how he has run it and built up defense line.

That seems to be a difficult and time, labor-consuming job. However, that would be Milim's worries. I'd rather prioritize my works at hand.

The rest of the demon lords' territory remain the same.

Some of which simply wanders around without territory, some of which hides their territory, or lives in a different continent. As such, no one really knows about other people's territory, and thus there's no notion of changing.

These demon lords all act according to their wishes and have their own means of communication.

The "Ring" I received as the proof of being a demon lord, not only can it identify the person itself, it is able to make "Cross-Spacetime Communication" with other demon lords.

It even has the secret call function for individuals, and also the ability to make a group call. What a convenient magical item.

With this ring---demon lord's ring, you can even make call from "Infinite Prison".

Since it's so convenient, I would like to put it in 'Analyze and Assess' and mass produce it. But that would be a secret.

After Clayman's conspiracy---the series of unrest within the Jura Forest, these are all finally settled. I've gained approval and become a new demon lord.

Although Clayman's master---Kazalim does raise concern for me, the issues regarding the demon lords are at last resolved.

---As such, I've become a member of the Octagram.
