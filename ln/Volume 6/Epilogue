# Epilogue: In the Holy Land

I thought I was dead for sure---bearing this in mind, Laplace tries to escape with everything he's got.

According to the plan, once the banquet begins, he would attempt to invade the holy land. He was planning to go to infiltrate the "Inner sanctum" where he last encountered the demon lord. Laplace headed towards the interior of the holy church, however...

He encountered the person he least wanted to see.

That was the strongest beauty "Head of knights of the pope's Imperial guards" and the commander of the Holy Knight Order, Hinata Sakaguchi.

*What the hell! How did this happen, this isn't going as he promised at all!*

Laplace complains in heart about his employer who's not present.

After all the promise and meetings, the employer decided to take care of distracting Hinata by asking her out.

Ahaha, sorry, sorry! He seems to hear the casual apologies of his employer. This is clearly a hallucination, but Laplace is still pissed about it.

But even so, this is no time to complain.

"How dare you infiltrate such holy residence; you pests surely are annoying."

Laplace got scared almost to death hearing Hinata spitting out that line cold-bloodedly. He escaped without hesitation and was able to save his ass.

How could he be motivated at all to explore the "Inner sanctum", the mission was a failure.

But, it's not Laplace's fault.

*And just when I thought demon lord Valentine is out... I won't stand a chance if that woman is guarding the place...*

"How the hell I am supposed to win against that type of monster---"

Laplace mumbles, he's already given up and decided to retreat.

Speaking of which... Laplace thinks to himself--- I've been running away a lot lately.

I am good enough to be able to escape from Hinata---he wants to praise himself that, but he still feels rather conflicted. Lately his luck has been on the downside, so he'd better not get cocky now and thinks he'd be able to escape---

Laplace's thoughts were paused at that moment when he senses a strong shockwave of magic while seeing a distortion of space outside in the surrounding of Lubelius.

"Ehhh...no...way..."

I'm dead---Laplace wants to cry.

Whatever is causing the phenomenon is already far beyond the realm of higher majin, it's clearly a powerful individual on a different level. Moreover, Laplace is somewhat familiar with that wavelength.

"Trash, how dare you show yourself before me again!"

The rage of Demon Lord Valentine burn, his furious shouts spread all around Laplace.

"Damn it! And now we get a demon lord!"

This is the worst; Laplace wants to exclaim out loud for his misfortune. But right now, there's no time for such things. He again braces himself to escape with all he has.

"Huh! You trashes are all the same. Why are you all so fond of running away?"

---At that instant, Laplace is estranged by the words of Valentine. He stops his footstep.

"What do you mean by that?"

"Huh, it's none of your business, but I'll tell you anyway. Just now, Demon Lord Clayman is dead. That moronic, treacherous trash is just like you, running around with his tails tucked. He even cried embarrassingly in the end."

Valentine spitted out the line, unimpressed and mockingly.

"WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?"

"Hahaha, why are you getting so pumped up about it? This is none of your business, right?"

"Shut your mouth! Oi, you said Clayman is dead, is it true?"

"HA-HAHAHA! Trash, now you've slipped up. Of course you are all in this together. Everything is as Luminas-sama predicted!"

Laplace is frozen in shock watching Valentine laughed out loud.

Clayman is dead, he can't quite process that for the moment.

It's not exactly impossible to believe, but he's not willing to do that. To Laplace, Clayman may be a bit psycho at times, but he's still his companion who shares the same dream and ambition, more importantly, a good friend to Laplace.

"What are you laughing at, you bastard!"

"Trash, who do you think... Guwu!"

"YOU SONUVABITCH! STOP LAUGHING AT MY FRIEND!"

Beaten to death with bare hands.

That would be the words most suited to describe the scene. Laplace's fists did not stop for an instant.

"Wuu, don't get all cocky now, you trash!"

Valentine's face started to turn red due to the anger and humiliation, shouting and staring at Laplace.

The opponent it's Valentine who possesses "Ultraspeed Regeneration", no matter how you beat me it won't work at all. The fools must be punished and killed. Valentine thinks to himself.

He unconsciously rubs away the blood that has splashed out, no, he was turning the blood into a red mist of blood fog, spreading it to the surrounding---

"Go to hell, 'Blood Flash Shock Wave'!"

---Being trapped in the inescapable blood barrier, the blood beam fired towards Laplace who is impossible to escape---Yet it didn't go as he wished.

"It's futile, you are already dead."

"---Wuu!"

Valentine couldn't react in time. He, who possesses immense power is being played by such low life trash. He planned on using his strongest skill to take his life, yet strangely, his ability is not activated.

Tonight is indeed the night of new moon; it is the day when Valentine has the least amount of power. But it matters very little when you've reached a level such as demon lord.

Perhaps the weakening didn't really have an impact. Then, there is only one logical explanation.

Laplace is very strong.

That explanation is quite correct indeed.

Laplace is holding something in his hand, something that is still beating.

"---Wuu!"

"That's right, this is your heart (core) that I hold in my hand. You can't move now, can't even make a sound, right? This is all my work."

He announces that cruelly.

Unknowingly, Valentine's body starts to tremble. Almost if...

*Is, is this fear? Am I afraid?*

"You are rather late to realize that. Yeah, I'm pretty strong."

Color begins to fade on Valentine's face, and he begins to show a desperate expression.

What Laplace is holding is indeed my heart---Valentine realizes that in shock and realizes his defeat. Seeing the expression on his opponent, Laplace begins to laugh hysterically and smashes the heart into bits.

The victory has been settled.

Laplace won't stop laughing.

---Ah ah, Footman is gonna be pissed.

He laughs as he kills off all the guards who discovered him.

---Ah ah, Teare is definitely gonna cry.

He bears his head deep and attempts to escape.

---That's why, I'm going to laugh.

He thinks "You are one big dumbass", this is Laplace's teasing of Clayman.

Because he thinks, that's the best way to send off "The Laughing Clown".

He won't be angry and won't cry.

He will laugh in place of his friend who can no longer laugh.

Laplace laughs.
