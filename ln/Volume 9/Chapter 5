# Chapter 5: After the|Festival

On the last night of the festival, we made sure to go out with a bang, hosting a grand banquet.

Chefs like Shuna and Yoshida-san were going all out to provide us with some breath-taking and extremely luxurious cuisine. All of this was to make a good impression on everyone.

Perhaps some new relationships had sprouted over the past three days since I could see nobles having a great time together. Unlike the first night, the mood at the banquet was a lot more relaxed.

Right, except for Veldora, Ramiris, and Milim staying inside the labyrinth, people like Karion, Frey, and Midley all came to attend. Everyone was enjoying the night cheerfully.

Treyni and the elves were also preparing dishes enthusiastically. I would have to show up with some dessert later on, as thanks.

And the townsfolk were not idle either. Visiting merchants, adventurers, nearby farmers, and the town residents were all enjoying the food and drinks in harmony. None of the stores were charging service fees tonight, it was a rowdy scene with people drinking and singing all evening. Everyone seemed to have lowered their guard, monsters, and humans alike, all were happily enjoying the night.

We also had music at the scene, some people were singing along to the tune, and some others were dancing to the rhythm.

*It's a shame it's going to be over so soon...*

Starting tomorrow, everyone would be back to work. The thought of it made me sad yet excited at the same time. What a bewildering feeling. Even if I wasn't the only one thinking along those lines, everyone was enjoying the moment.

*Maybe this is what happiness looks like.*

Watching this joyous scene, I sincerely hoped that this peace could last a long, long time.

And just like that, the night quickly passed---

![hard scene break]

After everything that happened, the festival was finally over.

In Gobta's absence, Rigur was kept busy taking care of security---the roads could barely contain the flood of visitors returning to their own countries.

"Wouldn't you have wanted to sleep until noon on the day after the festival?"

"Hahaha, Rimuru-sama. Those foolish enough to lose themselves to things such as alcohol can't manage the security force!"

Rigur was earnest. As expected from Rigurd's son.

If it were Gobta, I'm certain that he would have said something along the lines of "I wanted to sleep until the afternoon for at least the day after the festival." Although I myself felt the same way, which is why I often spoil the guy by accident, *it's for the best if I just don't bring this up.*

Unlike Gobta, Rigur swiftly ordered his subordinates to move without a single complaint. Thanks to his efforts, we were able to move the guests without any big problems.

The road was wide enough so, as long as the road wasn't blocked by the carriages, there wouldn't be cases where the line for humans would stop. I left the traffic control to Rigur and went back to do my own job.

![break]

That's right, today was the day I gave out gold coins as payments.

Over a hundred merchants gathered at the conference room.

Currently, Rigurd and Myourmiles were sent to do the explanation, but it seemed about time for me to take the stage as well. I knew that what came next would be the main show, so I lightened myself up and went to the venue.

As I arrived at the conference room, there were noises of arguing coming out of there already.

"As I've said before, we will pay up the fee in time, so please calm down and wait!"

"Are you saying so just to deceive us?"

"We've already waited until the festival ended. Pay us our money right now!"

"Hold on for just a moment, please! You all have a point, but is it possible for you all just to sell me a favor?"

"Indeed. Are you planning to destroy our reputation after we have already introduced you to our friend Myourmiles?"

"Let's not put it that way, my lord. After all, we only wish to be paid by the amount promised by them---"

"That's why I'm asking you to wait for another moment. This country is not going to run or disappear. They've already said that they have other means of paying than through dwarven gold coins. Can't you guys let this pass for our sake?"

"No way we'd believe that---!"

"Yes, that's right. Pay up already---"

It seemed like Myourmiles's friends---the big store merchants, were stepping up to comfort the retailers.

Although they may have just been acting in accordance with the way of a merchant, I still felt very happy about it. It showed that Myourmiles had keen eyes when examining a person's character^[Therefore, who he befriends.].

"Now, now, everyone, how about we all calm down? I am Muze, the representative for the kingdom of Guston. Even the people of the monster kingdom wouldn't dare repudiate the debts of those people. Am I correct, Myourmiles?"

*Looks like there is some big shot here.*

Representative of the kingdom of Guston---*in other words, does it mean he's a noble from the trade nation Guston near Ingracia?*

"Yes, Duke Muze-sama! That is correct. But---"

Hmm, although Guston was not a big nation, this was still the duke of the kingdom. Noblemen were already of high social status, and to have the title of duke implied he was some big-shot nobleman.

"Then I hope that you will reassure these people quickly. Let us proceed according to the international charter designed by the Western Nations and conclude the payment as soon as possible."

Looked like Duke Muze was not only a powerful nobleman, but a gentleman in negotiation.

While Myourmiles was a key figure in our country, as of now, he was not given neither a title of nobility nor a status. He was someone who was serving as my substitute and had only temporarily been given authority. In terms of his political stance here, he was probably the equivalent of "a guest that was invited for a meal."

While Rigurd was present as well, not only did he remember Myourmiles's name, he even responded to him personally. Perhaps this might have been the highest degree of courtesy to him.

For a noble to remember a commoner's name---while most nobles would not be able to remember, even those who did remember would probably just act ignorant to abide by the noble way. This was something I heard from Myourmiles; I could only imagine that he himself was the one most shocked at the scene.

"P-please hold up a second, Duke Muze-sama. We said from the start, when signing the contracts, that we will be paying according to the custom. And naturally the custom is---"

"Myourmiles, I don't really care about those minor details. It's the same to these merchants for whatever you were going to say. Trust is the most valued aspect in an exchange between nations. And trust only seeds when both sides follow through with their promises, isn't that the case?"

"What you said was correct. But---!!"

"Shut it! These people made a deal with your people because they trusted you. Are you perhaps planning on insulting this trust?"

"Of course not. But we have our reasons as well---"

"Heh heh, I see how it is now. Myourmiles, luckily enough, I got a solution to your worries. Would you mind having a chat with me in private? Rigurd-san over there can come as well."

---*Ahh, now we can confirm.*

This had unfolded just as Elmesia predicted.

It was like looking at an exam question that you had studied for, a feeling of relief that I couldn't put into words started to flow inside me.

*Now we can win with ease.*

"W-what do you mean?"

Myourmiles was acting in a meticulous way. As expected from an experienced merchant, he was both bold and great at acting. Just like me, he had already realized the truth, yet he continued the conversation without a change in expression.

I think the problem could have just been solved with our competent Myourmiles alone. But if that were to be the case, I wouldn't be able to get over my anger.

*Well then, let's move out. There is no point in just listening here so let's just quickly resolve this mess.*

![break]

Diablo pushed the door open with great force.

"There will be no need for that," I announced while entering the room. Benimaru and Shion followed. Diablo entered last and quietly closed the door.

"Have we kept you all waiting for too long? The arguing here just now sounded quite intense." Benimaru glared at the merchants as he finished.

Surprised by my appearance, the merchants turned blue upon hearing those words. They probably assumed that I would leave the matter entirely to Rigurd and Myourmiles to handle. But now that I had shown up with my executives like this, these people didn't know how to react.

"Demon Lord Rimuru-sama has arrived. Salute at this instant," Rigurd said while giving the merchants a hard glare.

Some of them immediately stood up and bowed in salute. But at least half of the people instead looked at me with confusion, they simply sat in their chairs and observed the situation.

Well, for retailers that did not get proper education such as the nobles, this was probably how they would react in such circumstances.

Even Duke Muze tried to stand up, but I spoke out to stop them.

"No need to abide by the formality, Rigurd."

After I said that with a smiling face, I glanced around the conference room. Rigurd obeyed my order and fell quiet and observed the room.

I could see not only the merchants, but also disguised reporters. It seemed like in the case of our nation doing anything inappropriate, they would go back to their respective country to report the matter.

Whether we were to cry and beg about how we couldn't pay or to shut the merchants up with violence, no matter how we reacted, they would probably report something ridiculous regardless.

But we were already informed about that. They couldn't expect that some of the more friendly reporters had already let Diablo in on the plot beforehand.

*Kufufufufu, how very moving for them to have such a thought*---Diablo complimented the reporters with this line, but they only seemed to respond with a numb smile out of fear. They had probably experienced something horrible in the past and had sworn not to antagonize Diablo---that's the strong will that was giving off with their reaction. They may have received some form of threat, but that was between the reporters and Diablo.

*I shouldn't really ask too much about the matter.*

![break]

"I see it is Your Majesty Rimuru. A pleasure to meet you. I sincerely apologize for only greeting you just now."

Duke Muze had quite the style of a nobleman as he bowed elegantly. He only panicked for a second upon seeing me before regaining his composure. A gentle expression emerged on his face as he greeted me in the place of everyone else at the scene.

"So you are Duke Muze of the Kingdom of Guston. Why are you here? Shouldn't you have no business here?"

I smiled and said the line that I prepared.

There was no need for me to be timid just because he was a nobleman, so I responded quite smoothly. Practice and rehearsal sure are important.

"The thing was, a lot of these people were trading with your nation for the first time. They came complaining to me about how their legitimate rights were despised upon. It is the duty of a nobleman to protect my citizens. So I came despite knowing the rudeness of my intervention in order to have a verdict on the matter."

*How shameless. This guy's a wolf in sheep's clothing.*

*Although with that being said, I'm not any better than him, except that I'm a slime, so I'm pretty transparent.*

"I see, how tireless of you. But there's one strange thing I must say, Myourmiles over there said that our nation has a big enough budget to afford the payment, but there was a delay in the final transaction, how was that the case?"

"Well, about that, it's because these people would only accept dwarven gold coins---"

Myourmiles was a good actor. He pretended to panic upon hearing my question and tried to explain. But he was interrupted by Duke Muze.

"That is only natural. Myourmiles, if you were a licensed merchant in the Kingdom of Blumund in the past, you should be well-versed in the international charter with regards to trade! Unlike whatever rubbish that's been carried out in that Freedom Association, these people only trust dwarven gold coins," Duke Muze explained calmly to back up the merchants gathered here.

He was definitely acting like a neutral third party with good intentions on purpose, trying to mend the matter for us and sell me a favor. That's why no matter how you looked at his attitude now, it would appear justified.

But this is no different from forcing others to follow their rules.

I quickly glanced at Diablo.

Having understood, Diablo smiled and nodded back in response.

*Now we have everything prepared.*

"I see, so that's how it is. I was wondering what happened when I heard that reporters from all the nations gathered here. So this is for something this minor."

"So Rimuru-sama, please just leave me to handle it..."

Seeing the pressure coming from Benimaru, some of the merchants were terrified. Everything seemed to be going according to plan, they were taking the bait that we were pressuring them into submission.

"Don't get so worked up, Benimaru. It is understandable why the merchants were worried after hearing their explanation."

As I tried to calm Benimaru down, he seemed surprised. He almost looked unpleasant as the ordeal got interrupted despite the smooth smiling before.

"But Rimuru-sama, I am confused. Even if we didn't have dwarven gold coins, we still have ancient gold coins. If they won't take that either, we can always just give them the equivalent value of our nation's specialties. Why won't they accept these terms?"

"I believe that the merchants surely had their reasons as well."

I observed Duke Muze's reactions while making these conversations. It seemed like he was looking for an opening to interrupt. He wanted to be the guy to convince the merchants and lend us a favor.

"How about we do it like that? Would you first place your trust in our nation and as Benimaru-sama suggested, to conclude the transaction with a certificate or actual goods?"

To finish things once and for all, Myourmiles took the first shot.

If they agreed, then everything could be concluded peacefully.

But if they were to decline...

*If they won't even step down now with my presence, we will be forced to act with resolve.*

"H-how can we entrust you with that!"

"T-that's right."

"It was precisely because this was the monster kingdom, that we wished to be paid in a safe currency such as the dwarven gold coins. I do hope that your nation will b-be considerate about it---"

It seemed not all of them were merchants who were not accustomed to such situations, there were people who knew how to deal with the nobles. But what they said was all incredibly selfish and didn't consider us at all.

*Ahh, what a pity*---I thought.

![hard scene break]

Muze believed that the time was now.

He was worried that after being intimidated by the demon lord, these merchants would leave out of fear. But they were still listening to Muze's order.

But that was natural, to be honest. Muze was the duke of Guston. Even though he was of the young age of thirty-five, he managed to be acquainted with the great Rosso family.

They were one of the dominating forces of the Western Nations, with extraordinary statuses. Only a few had this power.

Therefore, in reality, those who dared to oppose Muze's order were less than few. The plan he was sent to enact this time came from the divine order of the elder of the Rosso. He ordered Muze to "Give favors to Demon Lord Rimuru and earn his trust". He also promised to promote him to one of the Five Great Elders when his task was completed.

The Five Great Elders---the people who stood at the top of the world. Muze was overjoyed. And he swore to carry out this order with all the power he had, no matter what.

Muze promised those greedy merchants that he would help them rise to affluence. He dragged the reporters of different nations down with him in order to ensure his personal safety. Muze was going to confront Demon Lord Rimuru himself. This was a job only he could accomplish.

It was said that Demon Lord Rimuru, not long after his birth (as demon lord), butchered Demon Lord Clayman, who was known for his cruelty. He then established himself as the new demon lord. Moreover, according to rumors, he was also acquainted with the "Storm Dragon" that massacred twenty-thousand soldiers in the past. He was a fearsome demon lord.

He was initially afraid to be in contact with Demon Lord Rimuru directly, but when comparing his fear to the future glory that he would bear, he managed to overcome his fear easily.

Muze was a man that only saw profit. And it was for this reason that he was manipulated by people, which he himself had yet to notice.

All of this was exactly as predicted by Elmesia El-Ru Sarion.

It was honestly surprising to Muze that the demon lord would personally come to such an occasion with his executives. He was planning to take down the man called Myourmiles before requesting to meet the demon lord.

Although it turned out differently from what Muze had planned, this in a sense had saved him plenty of work. There were reporters at the scene right now, and apparently more reporters were flooding in on the main lobby downstairs.

That meant that all his preparations were in place.

When the merchants rejected the demon lord's proposal, Muze's plan would be a success. The rest would be for him to calm the merchants and take over the situation. This alone should have Demon Lord Rimuru in his good grace already.

Muze was convinced of his success, and spoke with a calm expression---

![hard scene break]

"I am unsure about your view on the situation right now, your Majesty. But if you are troubled, would you mind discussing the matter with me personally? One should treasure every encounter, and I would love to offer my aid to your Grace---"

*Should I say that I've seen this coming, or should I call his acting too horrible.*

This was the suggestion that Duke Muze came up with.

Every executive standing behind me was giving the duke a cold glare. Observing their expressions, Duke Muze looked quite anxious. It seemed that he had realized that something was not going as expected.

*Now, time to wrap things up.*

"How kind of you to have such a thought, but there is no such need. Come in."

Geld entered the room upon hearing my command. In his hands was a plate with mountains of gold coins piling on each other.

"Uh?!"

"No way..."

"Are those all...?"

The room was riled up.

Duke Muze's expression changed drastically upon seeing the gold coins. It seemed that he had realized the failure of his plan.

"Since you've asked us to pay. Very well, here are the dwarven gold coins as requested."

Rigurd announced. At that moment, the room fell silent.

"P-please...hold on a moment, Your Majesty Rimuru!"

Duke Muze was panicking. But it was already too late.

"What is it?" I asked coldly as Duke Muze asked me with a desperate expression, "A-are all of these dwarven gold coins? Y-you know it's illegal to make counterfeit coins!"

*Heh---and you dare talk to me in that way?*

*How very rude of you, Muze-kun.*

"You dare say something so disrespectful towards Rimuru-sama---"

Diablo walked forward as he finished. Benimaru also gave a furious expression while Shion who stood behind me had been giving off a dangerous aura from just now. It was precisely because this was how things would turn out that I had hoped Muze would mind his tone.

"M-my apologies for the intrusion. But, but are these really all---?"

"You may have them appraised if you have doubts."

As I said so with a smile, Duke Muze shivered.

"Then do indulge me and allow me to use my precious magic item to investigate."

It was already rude enough for this person to interrupt my conversation between Muze... Never mind, there's no need to penalize him. This merchant was probably one of the co-conspirators under Duke Muze's command. Out of panic, he might have forgotten the good manners he was raised to abide by.

This guy was all pretending to be courteous to begin with. Although I was no better, I cut out to be a ruler either, so I couldn't really judge them.

*Whatever the case, we should continue the conversation.*

"Rimuru-sama, many reporters were asking if they could document the negotiation as part of a news report. What do you think?"

Shuna asked from the other side of the door through 'Telepathy Net' after she had acted in accordance with my plan.

The reporters had gathered outside according to the demand of Diablo. If I gave the order, they would rush in as witnesses.

"If that's the case, isn't it perfect timing? We will have the reporters as witnesses to your appraisal on the authenticity of these gold coins," Benimaru announced, playing along with Shuna.

And as planned, the reporters entered the conference room.

"Th-these are authentic---!!"

*Muze's henchman shouted in astonishment. It took us so much work to get these, of course they are all real.*

"There's no way these are fake. From appearance alone you can tell they pack a punch. Some even looked quite dated, they must not have been flowing in the market," a reporter who looked knowledgeable commented. Those were probably the ones exchanged from Elmesia.

That gal seemed to have saved up as much as she could.

Now that even the reporters were analyzing the authenticity of the gold coins, Muze's henchmen couldn't really do anything to aid his cause. The reporters were useful in that they could prevent these people from switching the gold coins to counterfeits. But even if they did, Souei, who had been observing in the shadows, wouldn't allow it to transpire.

"Now, is that enough? Those merchants looked quite concerned about the payment, hurry up and pay them already."

As I announced so arrogantly, Rigurd and Myourmiles nodded and said: "Yes sir!"

They then began the process of verifying contracts and paying the merchants.

![break]

And---

There wasn't much slip up later. Under the watch of the reporters, the transactions were completed smoothly.

"Looks like you were the last one."

With that, all payments were delivered. This concluded all transactions during the festival.

"Ha, hahaha, as expected of Your Majesty Rimuru. How did you manage to gather so many dwarven gold coins..." Duke Muze said with a stiff face.

As we finished counting, there was a mountain of gold coins before Muze's eyes. A mountain of shining, almost uncountable amounts of gold coins. The merchants looked confused. They probably didn't know what to do either as things had deviated so greatly from their original plan.

It was then that the suspected henchman spoke again.

"Well, since your nation has done according to the international charter, we have no more complaints. We will be in your care from now on as well---"

"Oh, that wouldn't be necessary," I answered.

The merchants looked shocked as they heard my words. So were my executives.

"Wh-what would that mean..."

"Our business with you all ends here, from this instant onward. There won't be a next time. That's what I meant," I announced casually.

The executives were all filled with surprise. Except Diablo, who had been giggling at my answer. Only this guy saw through my thoughts. *There's nothing I could do with this lad.*

"I don't quite understand what you are getting at..."

"Wh-what are you planning? Isn't it enough that you've earned our trust by paying us?"

"Are you looking down on us because we are just retailers? But without us wandering merchants, nations can't do much of any trade among each other!"

They finally seemed to come back to their senses as the merchants began to shout and complain.

"You people, don't you think it was *a bit too rude* to speak to Rimuru-sama, the ruler of this nation in that tone?"

Shion spoke with a hidden cluster of fury. Realizing this, the merchants all shut their mouths.

Since they all went quiet, it was time to finish the whole ordeal.

"Since it'd be too much trouble to be subtle about things, I'll just put this out there. Weren't you guys complaining about how our nation has no 'credibility'? This so-called credibility should be established on the basis that both parties trust each other, not for one party to force the other into accepting their own terms. That is just how I see it. Didn't Myourmiles already requested many times for you guys to trust us?"

"T-that's..."

"But..."

"Well, I can't say that we don't understand your sentiment. We are monsters after all, even when we announced that our nation wished to communicate with the Western Nations, you were still unsure as to whether we would really follow through with regulations set up by humans---that must have been how you felt."

"Ye-yes that's it! So that's why---"

"However, we did make compromises as well. Didn't we offer you to exchange goods as well as payment in forms of ancient gold coins? But none of you even cared to consider these options once."

"...!!"

"Ugh..."

Myourmiles had already desperately tried to negotiate with these people countless times, even humbling himself to begging for a solution. Yet all of his efforts were rejected by the merchants here. *That I cannot forgive.*

"Just like you all wanted to trade with trust-worthy partners, we too would only want to deal with trustworthy people. That's why all of you, from now on, are forbidden from trading in our nation. We will not allow you to enter our kingdom, nor will you dream of getting a trade license."

The merchants realized the severity of the situation upon hearing my announcement. On this land filled with potential, they were no longer welcome.

Duke Muze looked pale as he seemed to have realized his plan had been foiled completely.

"T-this is outrageous! These people were merely defending their rights based on the international charter---" Muze, having lost his temper, protested.

*It'd be the end of him if they can no longer trade with our nations*. He must be thinking so.

Indeed, this land was expected to develop into a town with significant economic influence. It may be as powerful as the entire Western Nations combined.

That must have been why he tried to befriend us in the first place---*if you have already seen that far into the future, you shouldn't have played tricks like these.*

*Because I show no mercy to my enemies.*

"Rights you say. You seemed to have been mistaken. Allow me to clarify, our nation has yet to join the Western State Council. We did have the intention to join, but it's really not that big a deal even if we don't'."

"What---?"

"Well you see, this land will no doubt grow to be an important economic hub. This is an undeniable fact at this point, or at least that's what I am driving towards."

"What nonsense!! By what? Your own will? How dare you say something this arrogant---"

"It's not arrogance at all. Everyone here has united to head towards the same goal. And in the end, there will only be one outcome. I'm simply part of our momentum."

I tried to make it sound nice... But in reality, I did put what I personally wanted on priority and to make them into reality. That's why I honestly couldn't deny it when he called me arrogant. But nonetheless, I still managed to argue back sounding all justified.

"I also wanted to build an equal relationship with the Western State Council. But the deal's off if they try to suppress our nation in any way. We don't really need to play along with them as long as we trade through the Freedom Association. Is that understandable to you?"

Besides, even if we needed to, we could always just make an exclusive deal with countries such as Blumund or Dwargon. We only had to make such deals with countries we trusted.

We also had plenty of tricks up our sleeve, so there's no need to panic. We could also just develop our country and raise our influence until countries willing to trust us stepped forward. This thought had solidified in my heart.

![break]

"Uh, I understand. Then allow me to be the bridge to connect your nation and the council. It seems that there has been a grave misunderstanding, but I still hope to be at least of some use to you, Your Majesty Rimuru."

*You sure tried your best, Duke Muze. Seriously though, had you decided to stand down early on... I didn't plan to say what I have to say now.*

"Huh---I can't really have Muze-san as my intermediary. Since you've lost the power to do such a thing?"

"What?"

Duke Muze was shocked by my words and wasn't able to react for some time.

Since the whole ordeal has already concluded anyway, I didn't want to say this to his face directly. But at this point, I suppose explaining things thoroughly to him would be a form of mercy.

"Every reporter in this room will write about this incident in their respective nation. The content will be that there was a secret power struggle behind the Founding Festival of the Monster Kingdom, which has to do with the payment for the merchants. They will make sure of the facts and write what must be very interesting articles."

"..."

Duke Muze was completely baffled at the moment, upon thinking what would happen later, his expression looked dimmer and dimmer. This was precisely why I didn't want to say those things.

"The merchants ignored our request and would only take dwarven gold coins. The strange thing was, despite being completely unrelated to the whole ordeal, some big-shot nobleman came forth all of a sudden and managed to calm all these merchants down. I wonder what people would think when they see news like this."

"Th-that's..."

Well, this was Diablo's plan.

He gathered a bunch of reporters for them to observe all of the details. This way our nation would be portrayed as the reasonable side while the merchants would appear as though they were all working towards some sort of a conspiracy.

I agreed with his method.

Since information was only useful when used correctly. As opposed to allowing people to fabricate stories about us, I'd hope that facts of the matter could be reported word for word from the start.

That being said, it was thanks to Gazel and Elmesia's advice that we were able to come up with such a strategy.

Even Diablo said that "I still have much to learn" before expressing gratitude to them both. This time we were totally in their care. I'd have to thank them properly when such opportunities arose.

"That's how it is. We have no need for you to do anything. Also, I have one hundred percent trust in Myourmiles, who you have looked down upon. I'm even willing to hand our nation's financial sector entirely to him to manage. He's a lot more useful than you."

"Uhhh---"

Duke Muze's face twisted out of humiliation.

The merchants all looked desperate.

In comparison, the reporters looked happier than I expected. Since they were not the victims here, instead, some of them were even writing down the details of the negotiation with much vigor. Some have even brought expensive magic items such as video recorders. Surely the story of this incident would quickly spread among the nations.

These merchants brought the reporters here as insurance, yet now they had become their doom.

"I'll leave the rest to you."

"I will take care of everything now, Your Majesty Rimuru."

Myourmiles acted with extreme courtesy. As I passed him, I gave him a pat on the shoulder and whispered: "Be counting on you, Myourmiles-kun". After which, I left the room with the executives.

![exact fit image](image12)

I thought I saw Myourmiles-kun giving off a wry smile. Well, it wasn't really a physical one. And next, he switched to his elite look, unique to a merchant, and turned to Duke Muze, as well as glancing around the merchants.

Surely Myourmiles's prowess had also been observed at length by my executives.

People shouldn't have any complaints now, even if I appointed Myourmiles as the minister of finance.

"Then the transaction has been completed successfully, and our festival is officially over. Please follow me to a different venue---"

Myourmiles's stately voice came out of the room.

Now we could finally say that everything had concluded.

![hard scene break]

Having chased away Duke Muze and his lackeys, there were still many problems left for us to tackle.

We would hold our routine conference to reflect on ourselves.

We were not going to the guest lobby, but the usual large conference room. We gathered there on the night following the end of the Tempest Founding Festival.

Gazel, Elmesia, Youm's party, Fuze and even Yuuki, Hinata and Masayuki got a seat as visitors. There were also a few rare guests that had come upon receiving my invitation.

Since all of my executives had gathered as well, the room felt crowded.

I didn't invite Milim and the other demon lords. If there were too many people, the conference could last for days. Especially considering the many incidents that occurred during the festival, there were tons of motions for us to go through.

My only concern was Veldora. He was moping in the corner of the room, and he was bound to interject at some point. Probably along the lines of "No challenger came to fight me," etc. *Ah, what a bunch of useless complaints.*

*It's best that we don't complicate things further. Let's get the reflection conference going.*

![break]

"Eh---first off, I want to say this to everyone, thank you all for the hard work this time!"

I started by praising everyone and began the conference.

The first one to speak was, surprisingly, Benimaru.

"I was genuinely shocked just now. I didn't expect Rimuru-sama to punish those merchants like that."

The executives nodded in agreement.

Most of them probably thought that I would conclude the matter after the payment. But upon seeing my serious treatment towards them, everyone, without exception, looked surprised.

"Right, I didn't expect you to give such a severe punishment," Rigurd agreed with Benimaru.

Gazel, who had been listening to our conversation, intriguingly asked me: "So? What was your verdict, Rimuru?"

Having been asked, I retold the whole story.

![break]

"To have severed ties with them while mustering such resolve..." Gazel said, rather dumbfounded, after hearing the story. But he wasn't mad, quite the opposite, as he actually agreed with my method.

"Heh heh heh, I think you did the right thing. An eye for an eye. That being said, have you considered what to do afterwards?"

*I've really been outsmarted by Elmesia.*

Her insight was to the point of being frightening. It seemed that she had seen right through me.

"What did she mean by that, Rimuru-sama?"

Since Benimaru asked, I had to express my view.

"It's like what I said before, I'm not gonna play to the Council's score. If possible, I wish to be on equal and friendly terms with them."

"I understand that. That's why, in my humble opinion, we need to make a certain level of compromise."

I nodded to Rigurd and continued: "Listen well now! As Elmesia-san has said, that Duke Muze was just someone else's lackey. We followed their rule and rejected Muze. That's why, next time it will be his boss taking the lead in person."

"That is most likely the case."

"---In other words, will we be able to negotiate with them once more?"

"That's right. Since it was them that first failed in negotiating with us, when the opportunity arises, we can utilize our advantages in that regard to have better terms in negotiation!"

"I see..."

"In my opinion, they didn't want to antagonize us directly. That's why they wanted to put a collar on our neck by first befriending us. Now that they've failed, surely, they will have to consider us an opponent to be reckoned with. In that case---"

"Surely they will come across us again if they intend to launch economic warfare. Neither of us is prepared well enough to be able to do that. Therefore, both can form their own self-sustaining economic circle even without the opponent. That's most likely the case."

Gazel continued to further elaborate. For now, things had concluded with our negotiation. And it would seem that we had the upper hand in the long run.

"In that case, we don't need to be restrained by the international charter set by the Western State Council, and will be able to take over different nations by ourselves. But this will not be a militaristic invasion, but rather an invasive act via economy."

"Kufufufufu, leave it to me. I shall put all of the Western Nations on a platter for Rimuru-sama!"

*You don't have to. That's not what I wanted anyway...*

Diablo's comment was giving me a headache again.

"Diablo, if you do something like that, you will only make our life more difficult!"

Rejected, R E J E C T E D!

"A-apologies for my offense."

"Cut the crap, errand boy, go fetch Rimuru-sama more tea, now!"

Shion gave a finishing blow to the frustrated Diablo.

She also made me upset to be honest, but I'd give her a pass for now.

"I think what Diablo has just suggested may still be achievable given time. But right now, doing that serves no purpose. We may give it a try if conflict breaks out, but it will, nonetheless, be a lot of hard work. We just need to build a friendly relationship. Honestly, I don't want any more trouble to deal with."

As I explained matters like that, everyone seemed to agree.

We just had to try our best at making our own nation better. To create a firm economic circle on this land---that was our priority.

"Indeed, there's not really any other option than to negotiate with your opponent. But I'm actually pretty sympathetic towards them. They can't really restrain you with economic sanctions nor through military suppression. It'll really be hard for them to give any condition."

Elmesia shed a crocodile tear for our opponent.

*But doesn't that logic apply to Sorcerer's Kingdom Sarion as well...*

However, she had a point. Now our opponents were limited in their methods of comeback.

"I see. I am aware of these already. But, did Rimuru-sama have other plans as well to have treated those merchants so harshly---?" Geld asked.

He thought that I was being too harsh. Not every merchant was Muze's lackey, some were probably just pressured into doing it, having been blackmailed by Duke Muze. The fact that I punished them regardless of that was truly surprising to everyone.

Naturally, I had my reasons.

I smirked and was about to explain before Myourmiles, who was all smiles, interjected first, "Fufufu, that's very simple, everyone. Just as Emperor Elmesia said, we were simply giving them an eye for an eye."

"What does that mean, Myourmiles?"

"An eye for an eye?"

"I still don't get it..."

Whether it was Benimaru, Rigurd or Geld. All of them were still confused by this explanation.

Diablo seemed to have understood, but he was still quietly making tea. It would seem that he hadn't recovered from his frustrated defeat just now. Seemed a bit beaten.

*Aren't you a demon and all, are you really that weak-minded...*

"Rimuru-sama said that I would handle the rest of the matter. In other words, I was to do a favor for those merchants that now had nowhere to go, and convert them to our side instead."

Myourmiles sure was amazing. I thought that he might have known what I meant, but I didn't expect him to understand this so clearly. I was going to confirm with him later, but that doesn't seem necessary now.

---If you want to make these people behave, rather than resorting to threats or intimidation, it is better to do them a favor. It is much simpler and has a higher rate of success---

*It was what Elmesia said, and I'm putting it into practice. Sticks and carrots all at the same time. That's pretty much our tactic.*

"I see, as expected of Rimuru-sama."

"So that's the case. You have my approval."

"So, Myourmiles-san, did we really manage to convert those merchants?"

"Fufufu, we are guaranteed not to fail. I said that I would personally plead for them, and that was already a favor for those merchants. Thanks to Rimuru-sama's threat back then, this whole thing was surprisingly simple!" Myourmiles, with the expression of a scheming merchant, reported joyfully.

*It's great that we have succeeded, but this seemed to make me look like some sort of a villain. I'm somewhat offended by it, but I'll give it a pass.*

And as such, everyone was on the same page and we proceeded to the next motion.

![hard scene break]

Rather than calling it the next motion, I should have called it the main issue of the day.

"As I've just said, the matters regarding those merchants will be handled by Myourmiles-kun. The problem that has been troubling us for days has finally been resolved, I want to have everyone comment about how they felt during the Founding Festival. Any thoughts are welcome, don't reserve any of your opinions!"

As soon as I finished, Gazel let out a few dry coughs before quickly interjecting, "Rimuru, as the leader of your ally nation, there's something I want to bring to your attention. I've already commented on your out of line actions last night, this time my question is the same. What were you thinking when you did it?"

"Eh, what do you mean?"

I didn't quite get what he said, but considering how pissed Gazel looked, I may have messed things up again.

*However, I still have no clue. If I have to decide, it would be with regards to the handling of the merchants mentioned just now, but it didn't seem to be the case...*

"Are you really that self-aware? That's why I have to keep an eye on you this entire time! Vesta, weren't you and Gabil-san the ones that developed the projector machine? Wasn't it also your idea to give it some advanced application so that even long-distance images could be replayed in real-time?"

"King Gazel, a-about that..."

Vesta's face had "Oh shit" written all over it.

*Did Mr. Vesta get so into researching that he forgot to report back to King Gazel?*

Kaijin also muttered rather perplexedly: "This guy is still as careless as always." It looked like he was right.

"King Gazel, it's not like that. Vesta-san and I indeed developed what you just described and proposed to keep Demon Lord Clayman's legacy. However, the one who wanted to combine video recording magic items and the projector, was Rimuru-sama!"

Gabil was famous for his frankness. He revealed the whole ordeal without hesitation.

His words made Vesta look awkward while I looked troubled.

"---It's just as I thought. Next time before you go public, could you at least give me a heads up and discuss it with me a bit," Gazel, looking worn out, gave me this rather straight-forward bit of advice.

To us, the projector's value was that it was a convenient and irreplaceable invention for entertainment. But to the eyes of the kings and nobles of the Western Nations, it was an entirely different case.

"This thing has way too many applications, to the point that they're uncountable. At least to the crowd at the scene, everyone could tell its value," Gazel said unpleasantly.

*I just thought that it would be great to have a large screen to watch the expanded footage of the martial tournament and the labyrinth interior. And the people loved it too...*

But the device had given the officials of different nations quite a cultural shock, it seemed.

"With something like that, it would change the whole concept of war," Gazel's friend Vaughn said, Dolph-san also nodded in agreement.

They said that an immediate application would be in the military. One huge advantage was that they could now command the army from a safe distance. The officials of the army no longer had to risk themselves in any dangerous situation. Instead they could send out scout troops to check on the enemy status and quickly gain feedback to apply to their own army.

As opposed to the one-to-one "Magic Communication", this method would enable many times more volume of intelligence transfer. Everyone could share the same batch of information, and the accuracy of command would be greatly improved.

We published the technology at random, and it could already be called ultra-futuristic. It seemed to be a revolutionary technology.

I was only thinking "It'll be good to have something like this" and ordered people to construct the device. Yet it turned out that we made something incredible.

I muttered unconsciously that "You should have told me this earlier," but I was met with Gazel's stare and scolding "That was my line!"

*I am reflecting now, but that's not the point of this meeting. Not everything in this world will go according to our heart's content.*

"B-but, you must require a high level of magicule to operate the machine. If the mana of the user isn't high enough, it won't work. The distance and quantity of the intelligence transfer also depends on the user's ability. It's not that simple to apply it universally!"

I managed to cover my tail with this explanation. I had actually made improvements regarding these drawbacks by developing a system to store magicule. But it would be wise to save these words for later discussions with Gazel in private.

"Anyhow, just don't publish something that can be suspected to be of military usage so casually. You're the only one who wants to use it for entertainment..." Gazel told me, baffled.

![break]

And when I thought it was over, it was Elmesia's turn to cut in.

"I can actually purchase similar inventions in the future. I heard that there's something called a 'patent' in your world, right? I'm willing to pay the necessary price to purchase the rights for your invention, and grant me the privilege to use it first."

"Ah, then El-chan, please get this nation's bathing technology as well!"

"I got it, Elen. My negotiation with Yoshida-san has also gone well, you have to drop by my place more often in the future!"

"That's for sure!"

I didn't even get the chance to respond before Elen cut in to add to the mess. Elmesia also agreed happily. The two were sitting together like close siblings. This was the emperor, who Elen was facing, so at the end of the day, even if they were related by blood, this attitude was still way too casual.

On the other hand, I saw Elalude, her father's expression changed drastically as he began to shout in panic, "Elen, what are you doing!"

"Y-your Majesty! Even though she's my daughter, please don't spoil Elen! Also, Elen, you can't just call her Majesty the emperor 'El-chan'."

"Elalude, why do you talk so much?"

"Seriously, dad's always so dramatic."

I had a feeling that when these two got mixed together, things may get dangerous. I suddenly felt bad for Elalude. Elen and Elmesia also shared a surprisingly good chemistry. You can't fake a friendship like that, they were really close to each other, going so far as to give high-fives. I couldn't feel their difference in status at all.

Even the aristocrats of the Western Nations couldn't approach her---to most, Emperor Elmesia El-Ru Sarion was indeed such an elusive top figure. Yet the sight in front of my eyes was really hard to imagine. Even the members of the Emperor's Imperial Knights standing behind Elmesia looked surprised at the scene.

"Members of the Magus! What you saw is the equivalent of a national secret, you must not leak this information!"

Although Elalude came out to give closure, there's no saying as to how effective it was.

Elmesia, on the other hand, paid no mind to what Elalude or anyone else said, she was gonna speak her mind regardless.

"Given this to be the case, I hope that you will send researchers to our kingdom. Of course, it will be considered an official employment. We will be paying the proper fee for instructing tech research."

"In other words, will you be in charge of finding the labor as well?"

"About that...I do want to do that. But if you are afraid of a possible leak of your core technology, we can also export the necessary instruments to address the issue."

"Um um, in that way, there will be a need to transport components made in our nation."

To respond to Elmesia's request, many conditions had to be satisfied first. For instance, the plumbing required for facilities relying on water, such as a kitchen, bathroom, or toilet, were all the product of dwarven technology contributed by Kaijin and the other dwarves. I wasn't sure whether technicians from Sarion could recreate them or not, but it would also take too much time for them to learn the technology from scratch.

With that being the case, it would be faster for us to export the domestically produced machine parts directly to Sarion.

"Since you are sending the parts, I hope you will be using that thing called a train. I will be providing funds for that as well; can you finish developing it faster?" Elmesia said, seemingly having seen through my thoughts already.

*Gazel has a Skill that can read minds, but does Elmesia have one as well? So far there's no sign of that, but I better not get careless. Regardless of that, her proposal is still worth considering.*

"We still have yet to develop the train itself. That's why, if any scientists or experts in magic from your nation are willing to offer assistance, it will certainly help speed things up."

"Of course we will! Elalude---?"

"Yes ma'am! I'm on it right now."

Elalude was as loyal to Elmesia as it gets. He didn't look like a nobleman of high authority, instead he seemed more like a conveniently placed errand boy. Seeing how Elalude was behaving, Gazel turned to him with a sympathetic look. Gazel had also previously mentioned that he couldn't raise his head before Elmesia either, surely, he related a lot to Elalude.

And as such, Emperor Elmesia of the Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion was willing to personally provide assistance to us.

Sooner or later we would be signing a research agreement and begin research cooperation officially. On one hand, we had Sarion with its pride of magic science, and on the other hand, we have the spirit engineering developed in Dwargon. It wouldn't be long before the dream of uniting the land was accomplished.

![break]

As for the "Surmounters" sent by Luminas, we considered also letting them join based on the circumstances. We would have to wait to see what kind of people they were. *However, they may actually come up with some interesting ideas, nonetheless.*

"That's truly reassuring, Elmesia-san. Now that our research program has been settled, surely our magitrain will be on its way soon."

"Ho? Is its name 'magitrain'?"

"Yes, it is installed with a motor using spirits---the 'Spirit Magic Core'---and manipulated using magic spells that would be implemented by magic science. Isn't it perfect?"

"Hmph, as if it's that easy."

"How interesting! How very interesting. I really hope you make it real soon."

Gazel was calling me overly optimistic, but he said so with a smile on his face, confident in my future success. *It seems that he won't be giving me life advice anytime soon.*

Elmesia's reaction on the other hand was like a child discovering a new toy. Her eyes were sparkling. It left a big impression on me, as it drew a very deep contrast with the gloomy face on Elalude.

*Anyhow, there's bound to be a lot of progress from now on.*

"Let's lay down the tracks to Sarion first. We can build it alongside the road construction. It will save us time as well."

Since our country was leading the charge, it was easy to standardize things. Laying down the tracks wouldn't be throwing up any issues.

I responded based on these considerations.

![break]

"Hold on! I have a question about the 'tunnel' proposed by Benimaru-sama in the past, is it really needed in the future?"

An unexpected question from an unexpected person. It was Momiji.

She asked us "Whether the tunnel was necessary," *does it mean that she's willing to let us dig through their mountain?*

"If it's possible, I hope to dig tunnels in the future. First, we will set up a checkpoint in Blumund, and then go through Farmenas until we reach the west gate of Armored Kingdom Dwargon. Based on that, in order for people to be able to move south from Blumund, we are expected to lay tracks to the streets of the Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion. It is hard enough to get the rights to use the land in western kingdoms already, we will also run a lot of losses by taking the long route around the mountains. But if this is something you dislike, then I wouldn't pursue the project any further."

"I see. Then I will trust Rimuru-sama's words. If you guarantee not to cause any harm to the holy mountain, I may consider giving you permission to dig this 'tunnel'."

"Really?"

"Yes, however, I have one condition. I hope that you can send Benimaru-sama as the person in charge---" Momiji said while blushing. It went without saying that I was an understanding man.

"Benimaru-kun!"

"Hold on! Rimuru-sama, are you selling me out?"

"Don't put it that way. Geld is handling some major cases now. If anyone's better at leadership than him, it would be you."

Geld nodded in agreement to my words. In contrast, Benimaru looked shocked.

"There's no way I can handle it. To begin with, I don't even have any relevant knowledge about construction work!"

*Oh yeah, I guess he has a point.*

"I see, so it really can't be..."

I was thinking about sacrificing Benimaru to get this thing over with. It would seem that life just doesn't always go my way. I wasn't planning for Benimaru to stay out for too long to begin with, this deal couldn't be done from the get-go.

"It is unfortunate, but Benimaru is my right-hand man. I suppose we still can go together to inspect the construction at times---"

"Ah, that would do just fine. Please come and rest at our village when you do," Momiji said with a smile all over her face. Seeing Hakurou on the side, smirking like his plot had come to fruition, it seemed that both of them had figured that this matter would quickly solidify Benimaru and Momiji's relationship.

"Benimaru-kun, why don't you just give in to this?"

"I'm not doing that. But I suppose I can be Rimuru-sama's guard during inspection," shrugging, Benimaru replied.

This was perhaps as much as Benimaru could back down for. I guess I'll take what's on the table, Momiji was happy as well. If I pushed now, it would be abuse of power. How their relationship would play out from here would be their own doing.

And so, I managed to profit from it.

"Please just call me Momiji, Rimuru-sama."

Hakurou acknowledged as well, apparently, I didn't have to be that respectful after all.

"Then, Momiji-san, is it okay for me to run an investigation to see whether the locale is convenient for tunnel drilling?"

"It's fine. We don't have a problem with it, though I hope that you will run your investigation carefully."

In other words, if the investigations showed that there was no issue, we could begin the tunnel drilling.

The attitude of the Tengu clan had softened on the matter. The project could finally proceed smoothly. How wonderful.

*Next time I should also visit Momiji's mother Kaede-san.*

I'd go with Hakurou when the opportunity arose.

"As you can see, Elmesia-san, we still hope that you can grant us the permission to cross the border into Sarion and run the investigation---"

"Everything has been approved. Elalude, do as you see fit."

This was my ideal model of a ruler---Elmesia's attitude of pushing everything to someone else to handle was giving me a lot of ideas.

"Yes ma'am. Your Majesty Rimuru, I will print out the necessary permits. However, regarding the construction within our nation, please allow us to prepare civil engineers."

Elalude seemed to have grown more and more wary. There's no way he wasn't an excellent minister, having worked under such a free-spirited emperor. But Elalude was still unwilling to comply with our terms without his own additional condition.

If we were to handle all of the construction, it would probably cause much inconvenience to them. I personally didn't object and agreed. Since both sides had agreed to help each other, the deal was sealed.

We were going to open a reflection meeting, yet the important topic suddenly got settled.

Since all of the big heads were gathered here, we skipped all the complicated procedures and went straight to the deal-making. Everything progressed surprisingly fast.

Well, most of this was thanks to Elmesia.

![break]

Under these circumstances, Youm, who had been listening to us quietly, had something to say.

"Young master---no, Your Majesty Rimuru. I have a question to ask, if it is convenient?"

With all these powerful figures gathered at the meeting, raising his own opinion already took a lot of courage. Youm seemed to have grown considerably since the last time we met.

"What is it, Youm-san?"

"I was going to explain it personally, unfortunately, I'm not as educated, so is it okay for my wife to explain?"

*Wife? Does he mean Myuran? It'd be surprising if Youm got some concubine, surely that wouldn't happen to Youm.*

Although it turned out that my worries were unnecessary, the one who stood up next was indeed Myuran.

"You look just as great as always, Your Majesty Rimuru."

"You too. Myuran-san, you look good, how wonderful."

"With the great debt I owe towards Your Majesty Rimuru, it is fine for you to call my name directly."

*No way. The meeting has been foiled by Elmesia with a bunch of casual nonsense, we can't have ourselves stray from formality, though it seems it's too late to say such things.*

*Then we will leave that for future discussion. Let's just talk casually now.*

"Then, Myuran, what's on your mind?"

"Yes, your Majesty, the question is about the proposal Rimuru-sama just mentioned---the route starting from the the Kingdom of Blumund, crossing through our nation, and reaching Dwargon. I believe you used to have a goal---to strive for the common prosperity of man and monsters---could you consider the project as part of this goal?"

Man and monsters... Circle of common prosperity^[This section's translation slightly deviates from the source, as in Japanese, the "Circle of common prosperity for men and monsters" was a short phrase as opposed to this very long sentence in English. Rimuru's inner monologue praises that it "sounded good to him", it was actually referring to that the phrase Myuran used was smooth on the mouth. The phrase was used a couple more times (as a name) later but would not be reflected in the English translation.]?

*That sounds good to me.*

"I suppose you can see it that way. By the way, great choice of words. You get the idea immediately upon hearing the phrase."

![break]

To work towards a state where humans and monsters could prosper together. Monsters as a whole came in a lot of different varieties too, though many of them should actually be called demi-human. But putting that aside, the phrase common prosperity really reflected my ideal.

With Tempest at the center, there was Dwargon in the east, Blumund in the west, and the huge monster circle led by Milim in the south.

There was also a large area of human residences further past the Kingdom of Blumund. It was connected to the Kingdom of Farmenas in the north, as well as the grand domain of the Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion in the south.

In addition---the Kingdom of Blumund was the window to the Western Nations.

If we had these kingdoms cooperating as well, the circle for human-monster prosperity was gonna live up to its name.

![break]

"Thank you for your response. Then my question is this: our kingdom will do what we can to help Rimuru-sama achieve this goal. Fortunately, our nations' nobles were all very initimi---persuaded by Diablo-sama there, they have become very obedient---I mean willing to help, well, mostly to the two of our opinions. That's why we plan to start a national business as the first step of a newly-rising nation. Based on these considerations---"

What should we do as business? That was Myuran's question.

"S-surely you should operate just as we planned before, running agriculture---"

"It shouldn't be an issue. Everything has been proceeding as planned, we've ordered people to handle specific crops."

"I see, what about---"

*Huh---what about what?*

I tried asking her about all the ideas I had, but it seemed that she had arranged everything in order. Diablo had obviously tamed the noblemen, Youm also gained massive support among his people. In terms of the military might of different factions within the nation, a consensus had also been reached.

The old Farmus had fallen, and the new nation of Farmenas had risen in its place. The first step was to end the unrest within the nation, which seemed to have been accomplished. In addition, they needed to comfort the citizens and gradually move the nation's industrial focus to agriculture...

Diablo must have been behind the scenes to help, but Myuran also seemed to have executed the long-term plan extraordinarily.

"Then could you gather those who are currently unemployed?"

"We shall obey Rimuru-sama's order. If possible, we were actually thinking about using our own manpower to lay down the railway tracks. Since it will become a method of transportation for our agricultural products, surely, the transportation network will be a major lifeline for our nation."

"Hmm, it would indeed. If you are not just growing the amount for your own nation's consumption, you are going to get a lot of surplus in the future. You will need to ship them to other nations in need, before they go bad. I think it will be an important industry for your nation."

In the past, the Kingdom of Farmus would resell goods from Dwargon, those were mostly handcrafts and gear, there was no concern over any items going bad. The merchants were responsible for transporting these items, and the country could easily profit via taxing tariffs.

This would no longer apply. The merchants would no longer be the sole responsible party for the goods, the nation itself would be forced to raise its own credibility. In store for them was the era of nations ensuring the legality of the flow of goods.

"I look forward to the day when the magitrain runs through the great plains. Surely the merchants in the future will change their trade model as well. We will need to continue to learn in order to catch up with the trend."

"It will be faster than horse carriages. Goods that are expected to be delivered in a week, it will only take three hours in the future. The storage space required will probably be a hundred times more than before."

" " "WHAT!" " "

Gazel and Elmesia had seen this coming, so they didn't seem surprised, but the same couldn't be said about the rest of the people at the scene. The news was probably too shocking, making everyone go numb. As for Yuuki, Hinata and Masayuki, they gave off a slightly different dry smile respectively.

"Anyhow, we need to purchase the land for laying tracks early, I want to plan out a straight and effective transportation route. Geld's men, as well as the beastmen studying at our town, have already learnt how to survey land. I will still do the final confirmation, but the rest of the work will be left to them. Myuran, you can find labor for them to command. Please bring someone who's literate to lead them and also divide them into different platoons."

"Understood. It's truly making me look forward to it," Myuran accepted my proposal.

Apparently, they were planning to offer us aid in the first place, the matter had been resolved smoothly.

![break]

Then it was Fuze's turn to raise his hand.

"Because of all the important figures gathered here, I waited until now to say anything," he ended his sentence with a wry smile.

Fuze was there since the pre-festival night. But he was timid, seeing all of the people gathered around, and didn't come up to talk to me.

I noticed that as well, but I couldn't find the appropriate time to talk with him. Although he seemed to have enjoyed himself during the festival, I planned to greet him later and just forgot about it.

"Ah, sorry. I was going to greet you back then."

"Rimuru-sama seemed busy then as well, it's all right. By the way, my friend wanted to talk to you too, this is great timing. What he has to say relates to what has just been discussed."

Fuze then introduced me to Baron Veryard, who I also knew well. I recalled him to be an experienced man who should not be underestimated.

"I am Veryard. I kind of forced my way to the meeting today. First of all, I want to thank Your Majesty Rimuru. And to everyone here, it is a pleasure to meet you."

He stood with great gesture and bowed elegantly. He clearly knew how to deliver a good greeting, nothing like some lowly noble from a small kingdom.

"Then, allow me to ask a question in the stead of the ruler of the Kingdom of Blumund, King Dolam."

Veryard suddenly squinted his eyes at the seats next to him.

The aforementioned royal couple were sitting there. *So, you guys actually came? I'm really not sure, considering how little presence you've shown throughout the meeting.*

I told King Dolam that we would have a proper conference planned after this meeting, now it would be unnecessary. This was the equivalent of the later conference.

Although Dolam was smiling like a nice guy, I couldn't help but ask, "Is this really okay." *Let's put that aside for now*, Veryard began to speak.

"As Fuze has mentioned, what Rimuru-sama has said is highly relevant to the future development of Blumund. King Dolam also predicted that our nation will become an important hub for the flow of goods. I've also had my theory before finally understanding after hearing your speech. In other words, your Majesty wishes to make our country a gathering point of all exports, is that right? Your Majesty mentioned that once this magitrain appears, the concept of logistics would change forever. If you are making our nation into a hub of sorts, surely goods from all over the continent would come through. In that case, we will need people managing these goods. In addition, if your Majesty wishes us to investigate what each nation is lacking in supply, that should also be properly arranged. Rimuru-sama, is this the role that you wish our nation to play?"

As expected from Veryard, being nothing like Fuze, he was quick on his feet.

He had spelt out everything in my head.

"That's the role indeed, will you be willing to do it? While it goes without saying, you can also just provide us with the venue to operate. I shall promise to pay up the fee for using the land with the amount of tariff we earned each year."

"Surely you jest. You shouldn't underestimate our people as folks who are satisfied with a lazy life of making profits from margins, and exclude us from the system. We will be training our people from now on, so as to prepare for the future!"

*Oh snap. Just how far ahead is this guy planning?*

I at least had the very competent Raphael-sensei with me, but how could this guy catch up with me, using just a human brain? This was beyond being a visionary, this man was very intelligent.

Surely the Kingdom of Blumund would have dramatic change that completely altered their past values. That was not just limited to Blumund, but surely there would be some major reformations.

Veryard had seen that clearly from the start, and so he had announced that they were already preparing for it. This man was something else. No wonder he managed to get his way with me. I was right to not underestimate this type of person.

*It's a relief that he's not an enemy, seriously.*

"Then there is a favor that I must ask. I'll need to trouble you guys with investigating the export items to each nation and build a system that delivers what is needed to where they are needed. Since your kingdom has a good intelligence network, won't you be great at the job?"

"Aha, I see Rimuru-sama is not one to be underestimated. Very well, I shall reflect in detail regarding the matter when I return."

*You can say that about yourself*, I thought to myself as I nodded.

![break]

I was only planning to open a reflection meeting about the festival, yet it turned out to be something so troublesome that it had worn me out. But it had a lot of value nonetheless, since our negotiation with Blumund was successful. I thought it would take a lot more time to finish this difficult negotiation. Thankfully, Baron Veryard was there.

*I'm unsure as to whether that was a blessing or a curse, but since we've reached this point, let's just ask them nicely for cooperation.*

Upon thinking so, I began to worry over what to ask of Veryard.

![hard scene break]

All right, now that we had finished talking about the difficult topics about running the nation, it was time to proceed with the reflection meeting.

I switched up my mood and wanted to hear what everyone had to say.

"Next---does anyone else have any opinion---?"

Hearing my words, someone stood up anxiously.

*It's Veldora.*

*I've got a bad feeling about this, so I'm just gonna pretend that I didn't see...*

"Rimuru, what the hell was that?"

*How am I supposed to answer that?*

"What do you mean?"

"The labyrinth! Of course. I was looking forward to it, and in the end, no one managed to get to the 100th floor!"

*Didn't I just give him a good scolding? Was he not reflecting at all?*

He really just ignored everything I said.

And I wasted my time practicing what to speak---Veldora kept on complaining, which really made me want to reply with a "so what." But I held back. If I were to say something like that, he'd definitely lose control.

"Well, personally I'm not that satisfied with that part either."

"Right? You are still so reliable as usual. How do you plan to adjust things going forward?"

It wasn't as if I would get an immediate result upon making adjustments. At least not until we had adventurers who had the abilities to reach there.

"In any case, based on what happened, there's no way we can proceed with this. Those adventurers were mostly either average or somewhat experienced. They are already pretty good challengers---"

"Pretty good..."

"That sounded pretty rude..."

"But I don't feel like we can deny it either..."

The Kabal trio seemed down, *but you guys spent all your time treasure-hunting, so I can be a little salty*.

"Don't be discouraged. All I did was walk the entire time. And for some reason we ended up at level ten. By the time I realized, my companions had already killed the Floor Boss..."

Masayuki was probably trying to comfort them, but no matter how you saw it, he sounded like he was ridiculing them. But Elen didn't seem that discouraged by it. Perhaps, to the trio, it didn't sound as bad. They looked surprisingly calm, so it was probably okay to leave them alone.

"---In other words, you should think that it is still not your time to shine yet!"

As for Veldora, there'd probably never be a chance for him to shine.

"WHAT! Then were Milim, Ramiris and my efforts in vain?!"

*Please count me in as well.* While I thought this to myself, it'd be best not to quarrel with him for too long.

"Don't worry. The labyrinth demonstration had a very good promotional effect on the different nations."

"Huh?"

"Myourmiles-kun, please come and explain!"

As I ordered, Myourmiles stood up.

He then began to explain very confidently to Veldora.

"Due to the public display of the interior footage of the labyrinth, all of the nations were very intrigued. The fact that a random treasure chest had the chance to give rare-grade items also added on to the promotional effect."

"And it's all thanks to me..."

*Um---I suppose you can put it that way... I guess?*

"All the noblemen from the nations would definitely want to send their adventurers there!" Myourmiles concluded his explanation.

It seemed that many noblemen hired adventurers or powerful mercenaries as guards. In other words, once these people caught wind of a labyrinth with piles of treasure, they would probably send a large group of adventurers to strike it rich.

Myourmiles also mentioned that the noblemen may sponsor challengers in order to obtain the treasure. In addition, unemployed adventurers may want to get involved for the money. They may try to challenge the labyrinth repeatedly.

They could probably tell from the experience of that Gai guy, that it was very difficult to obtain rare-grade gear.

I wasn't gonna reveal anything here, but Myourmiles is in fact planning something even shadier. It was something like a lottery, he had decided to spark people's desire to draw lottery tickets. He was gonna intentionally let people see others getting expensive items from the lottery in order to create a competitive spirit. His plan was to make the adventurers and the nobles be our captives (money trap).

Moreover, Myourmiles had other things planned out as well.

"In addition, I also want to establish a prize system. We will tell everyone that once they reach level 100---in other words, when they actually conquer the labyrinth---they can receive a huge prize. Naturally, many nobles would want to sponsor adventurers and other challengers and send them down there," Myourmiles said with a smirk.

*As long as we make the impression that the labyrinth is a place that will generate enormous profit, even the scrooge of noblemen will fall for it. They will probably hire the best of the adventurers, sponsoring them with gear to have a better shot at challenging the labyrinth.*

These noblemen were the so-called benefactors. If their adventurers performed valiantly, the nobles themselves got to share the glory. Moreover, this had tremendous potential for profitability. In other words, this was enough to motivate the nobles.

Moreover, while the noblemen sponsors stayed in our nation, they would also enjoy all the entertainment.

It also seemed like a good idea to use the live footage of the labyrinth walkthrough as an attraction. We would also be opening a variety of other projects as ways to attract more consumers.

Speaking of sponsors---I was even more impressed by Myourmiles upon hearing his proposal. He was already a bad boy in my book, but I didn't expect him to take it that far.

*Indeed, surely the sponsors will be happy as well if their challengers acted violently.*

He really did think of everything.

![break]

One last thing.

I needed the help of the Freedom Association with several project ideas I had with Myourmiles.

Veldora also seemed to have been suppressed by Myourmiles's presence and became a lot more well-behaved. This was a good opportunity for him to bring it up. Myourmiles began to discuss the matter.

"Leader of the Freedom Association, Yuuki Kagurazaka-sama, the thing is, we have a favor to ask, or rather, we have a proposal."

"Proposal? What would that be?"

"As I have just mentioned, our nation will be providing prizes for the labyrinth walkthroughs. I would like the Freedom Association to handle the matter."

"Why?"

"The biggest reason is for the promotional effect. Your association has divisions set up in different nations. It will be the fastest and most effective way to promote."

"I see, that makes sense. But what other reason do you have?"

"Yes. In order to manage the challengers, I would like to utilize the identity cards of the adventurers."

"I see now. Seriously though, that's some idea you've come up with..."

I'm not sure if Yuuki was impressed or shocked, he fell into his own thoughts as he sighed.

Our nation could also issue the permits to enter the labyrinth, but that would take a lot of extra work. We wanted to lower the budget as much as possible and borrow the labor of the Freedom Association. Such planning to exploit others was the core of Myourmiles's proposal.

"There're also benefits for the Freedom Association."

"Umm?"

"Due to Rimuru-sama's rule, the monsters in the Great Jura Forest have been under control. We would be running the long border near the Great Jura Forest. With that being the case---"

"I see, so you are saying that there will be less work for monster extermination?"

"Indeed. However, there's a solution. It can be imagined that the interior of the labyrinth will spawn a large number of monsters. By defeating these monsters, you can gain 'Magic Crystals', fur, monster teeth, claws, etc. You can farm monster materials on the regular---"

"...!"

"Surely the guild would gain profit through it?"

You could gain materials by exterminating monsters. Adventurers would sell the materials as rewards. If not, the Freedom Association would act as the middleman for purchasing these materials before selling them to buyers that needed them, making money via handling the transaction.

And our nation could hand over part of the management of the labyrinth to the Freedom Association and tax them for it. In this way, even if adventurers lost their job in the future, they could also find new employers. This project would provide multiple benefits.

*How would Yuuki react to this?*

"Will Rimuru-sama help out with ideas in the future as well? You must be Myourmiles-san. I will consider your proposition; we will handle the matter and build a division of our organization in this town. Will you be able to provide us with the facilities?"

"Most certainly. When the staff are settled, we will discuss further."

"I'm truly defeated here, Rimuru-san..."

Yuuki gave off a wry smile.

And so, Myourmiles's and my proposal were taken.

![hard scene break]

I spoke to Veldora.

"Have you heard, the proposal has been accepted. There's gonna be more adventurers coming in the future."

"Um, um."

"Within the first year or so, it may still pose a huge challenge. But after two, three years, I think there will be more capable people."

"Ho? Do you have any proof for that?"

"Well, the reason is simple. There is a very low chance of dying in the labyrinth, so you can practice your skills in it. There's no reason why you wouldn't become stronger throughout the process."

"I see. As expected from Rimuru, now I've got to look forward to it!"

To someone with longevity such as Veldora, two or three years would pass by in the blink of an eye. That's why his face was plastered with a smile as he commented about his expectations.

*Right, right, it's great now that I've managed to convince him.*

While I was laughing internally, Hinata suddenly raised her hand to speak.

"Can I interrupt for a second?"

"What is it?"

Although I didn't think she objected to the matter until now, my nerves were still kind of tense. *I suppose I'm once bitten, twice shy.*

"I have a request, or rather, a proposal."

Her tone was giving me a bad feeling.

Myourmiles on the other hand, was sweating while trying to avoid eye contact with her.

"...I'm listening..."

"Thanks, then allow me---"

What Hinata brought up was "Crisis awareness may be reduced as a result of labyrinth activity."

If they become accustomed to not dying in the labyrinth, it may cause them to become careless outside. That was Hinata's fear. I was worried about that too, but I felt that the adventurers should see to that themselves. I was a bit short on words while Hinata pointed it out.

"Uh---I guess we can only remind them to pay more attention..."

"Don't think that you can just hand wave this away, this is a matter of life and death."

"Ayy, let's not put it that way."

"No."

"Come on, Hinata-san?"

I begged Hinata. She finally decided to bring up her own proposition.

"---But, if you are willing to accept my proposal, I may just approve your plan."

"What proposal would that be, please indulge me?"

*Making Hinata angry will make me die pretty horribly. That's why I should humble myself.* But I may have worried too much.

"Hehehe, Rimuru, Rimuru---it's nothing really. You don't have to be that nervous, this proposal would benefit us both."

"Eh?"

"The labyrinth poses a pretty good challenge. Not only can one train their ability down there, we can also practice effective fighting strategies against monsters. However, I'm worried that people may put their guards down against death. That's why I want to dispatch the Priests of the Western Holy Church there."

"The Priests! No way, are you serious, commander Hinata-sama?"

It was Fuze who suddenly interrupted.

Many at the scene were shocked, and upon inquiring about it, I learnt that Priests were very capable users of holy magic.

*Now that you've said so, I believe I've heard similar rumors.*

There was a group of people whose ranks were above the average ministers and have learnt the secret "Holy Magic" of the Western Holy Church. And Bishops, as well as higher ranked personnel, could even perform "God's Miracle", a spell strong enough to restore damaged body parts.

"Yes, I'm serious. It was indeed a secret technique, but with how things are progressing, they won't grow in the future. Even though these people may have the talents of geniuses, none of them are able to cast God's Miracle "Resurrection". If this is to continue, the knowledge passed down from ancient times will be buried. It may be a different case when it comes to wartime, but such a technique is difficult to pass on during peaceful time."

*In summary, are their resurrection skills rusting because they don't have people to revive?*

While I felt that something was off, I understood what Hinata meant. She wanted to use our dungeon in order to train their "Holy Magic".

This was also pretty beneficial from our perspective.

Even though not everyone could practice God's Miracle of "Resurrection", if people capable of using revival magic in general increased, combat outside the labyrinth would be safer as well. In addition, it was also helpful for me to quickly fully understand the "Ultimate Secret of faith and grace" of Luminism via actual information of their practices.

*I don't oppose the idea.*

"Same here, we would be troubling you as well."

"Hehe, I knew you would say that."

Disregarding the shocked crowd, Hinata and I agreed to each other's proposals. Now the matter of dispatching Priests into the labyrinth was also settled.

![break]

Just as I thought that the matter was finished, Hinata raised another proposal.

"By the way, there's something else. I want the Holy Knights to challenge the labyrinth as well as part of their training."

"Huh?"

"Veldora-san over there---eh, weren't you selling takoyaki out there?"

"T-that's irrelevant to the topic, right? Let's get down to business already!"

"R-right, I definitely did not sell takoyaki under an 'alias'!"

"...Oh, and I almost managed to convince myself otherwise... It was you after all. Never mind, it's really nothing," Hinata muttered to herself tiredly.

It was impossible to deceive Hinata. Honestly, to anyone who had heard of Veldora in the past, there was no way you could fool them either.

Because Veldora was insistent on opening up a takoyaki shop, I asked Myourmiles to help him prepare shop staff. Veldora later came up with some ideas and requested Kurobee to prepare some iron griddles. It was the specialized iron griddle that is commonly seen in Osaka, Japan for takoyaki.

The condition for Veldora to open shop was to not expose his own identity. With that being said, the residents of the town already knew who he was. That's why I told him to at least hide his identity from the staff, and use an *alias*... And Veldora actually decided to use the name "Alias."

Allegedly, the shop called "Alias Takoyaki" had quite the popular sale.

*But that's really irrelevant to our topic right now.*

"Please forget about that first, I want to discuss in detail about the Holy Knights' training."

I managed to force the topic back on track. Hinata didn't seem to mind, so we continued as if nothing had happened.

"In my opinion, those who have just been enlisted as a Holy Knight wouldn't be able to win against Gozer. That's why I want to split them into groups of five to six people to challenge the labyrinth. On one hand they can practice combat, on the other hand, we can also train the Priests we mentioned. I believe anyone with experience can easily break through level 50."

"Ho? I'm fine with that. In fact, that's just down my alley!"

Veldora's spirits were high.

*Indeed, all members of the Holy Knights are over Rank A. Considering their abilities, only a group of a few Holy Knights may have a chance against Gozer.*

"In addition, I wish to let some of the captains join."

Hinata dropped the bomb on everyone at the scene.

"Are you serious? Hinata-sama!"

"Are we to join the labyrinth challenge as well?"

Arnaud and Bacchus, who were stationed in our nation, immediately asked Hinata. She was not fazed one bit and answered quite casually:

"Isn't that only natural? This is the perfect training ground, there's no worry of death. Since there is already someone that strong guarding level 50, surely it would mean there would be even stronger guardians as you go further down, perhaps someone even you guys won't be able to win against."

"Um um um," I heard Veldora responding as he listened with extreme satisfaction.

On the other hand, Arnaud and the others began to protest. It seemed that their displeasure was at the maximum as well.

"No no no, there's no such thing, Hinata-sama. We are the strongest of humanity, the Holy Knight Order---and 'Saints' who can stand against 'Demon Lords'."

"Indeed, we would agree if the opponents are the demon lord's subordinates, but mere labyrinth monsters---"

"If that's the case, show your strength to me now."

Arnaud and Bacchus's opinions were crushed before Hinata.

*Indeed, if they could manage to break through all 100 levels of the labyrinth, they may stand correct.*

*That would be a simple truth that cannot be rebutted.*

However, the sad thing was---

"Eh, hold up a minute, could the one guarding level 100 be..."

"Kukuku, GA-HAHAHA! This is supposed to be a secret, but let me tell you real quietly here. Indeed, the guardian on that floor is me, 'Storm Dragon' Veldora!"

Veldora-aniki looked really happy about that. In comparison, Arnaud and Bacchus were white as sheets out of despair. The yin and yang here made a pretty drastic contrast.

And so, I agreed to Hinata's proposal.

![hard scene break]

Given the state of the matters, everyone seemed to have spoken.

There was one more thing that I hoped to confirm with the opportunity. Or rather, it was the reason why I gathered all my connections.

"There is one thing I hope to ask---"

With that said, I began to ask about the eastern merchants.

I was guessing those people had been busy scheming behind everyone's back, mentioning this matter was also a reminder to everyone.

"Dwargon welcomes and accepts all, so with everyone coming and going, the eastern merchants probably also passed by. However---"

"To answer your doubts, King Gazel. All people entering and exiting our nation are under our surveillance."

While near the border of the Armed Nation of Dwargon, anyone would be under the surveillance of the spymaster Anrietta. To try to sabotage things would be the equivalent of committing suicide. So, the eastern merchants would probably behave there.

"Unfortunately, our nation was too weak as a trading partner. Moreover, the only advantage our nation had was the espionage department. Even though we do have a record of the flows of relevant goods, we don't often see any eastern merchants."

"Oi oi oi, your king is present right here, how can you say something like that..."

It seemed that not many people traveled to the Kingdom of Blumund. And since the nation itself was capable of surveilling these people, we didn't need to be worried about them.

"Is our nation fine in that regard?"

"Of course. All the foreign imports are overseen together, the thirteen royal families were not given authority over them."

Basically, Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion was almost in a lock-down state. There wasn't much communication with other nations, so the eastern merchants wouldn't be able to sneak in there. Moreover, there were few people that could manage to fool the eyes of Elmesia, so I didn't think it would be an issue.

The only nation that concerned me was the newly established nation of Farmenas run by Youm.

"Right, Diablo-san did order Razen-san to run the books logging trades."

"Seriously, don't put it that way. Excuse us, Diablo-san asked Razen to read through all the materials and check on the influence of the eastern merchants in order to cut them off from our nation."

*That's reassuring*, Diablo seemed to have handled everything. He's way too competent, how scary. I was going to praise him, but perhaps not in front of the guests.

"As for the Freedom Association, I'll have to leave the judgement to each division."

He had a point. Not all eastern merchants were schemers, surely there were people who just wanted to do business normally. You couldn't order the association to just suddenly pause trade with these people. The members of the association needed to make a living as well.

To this point, Yuuki promised to send people from the Freedom Association HQ to instruct things in secret. I'd leave it to him.

"The Western Holy Church---actually, Holy Empire of Lubelius have ceased trading with any eastern merchants."

"Eh?"

Hinata said something unexpected.

Upon inquiring, I learnt that Hinata was almost manipulated.

"The merchant's name was Damrada, some kind of a big-shot. That's why I trusted his words... And it turned out he deceived me."

"Deceived you?"

"Right, that night---Demon Lord's Walpurgis---someone invaded Lubelius. I managed to get back in time to chase him away, but in reality, the enemy seemed to have a meeting with Damrada."

"Um, they must be connected."

Upon hearing Hinata's explanation, Gazel also agreed that Damrada and the invader were in the same band.

I concurred.

The mysterious rival Hinata mentioned---*are these people tied in with the eastern merchants?*

*Speaking of which, it was the day that Demon Lord Roy was murdered. Could it be, that it was the invader who killed Roy?*

"Right, anyhow, I hope everyone has an idea of the situation now," I concluded as everyone nodded in agreement.

*That's good. We are going to put up our guard against the Eastern Merchants, and we should do our best in getting hold of their future movement.*

After confirming everyone's will, the meeting was dismissed.

![hard scene break]

Later, the conference room was left with me and my companions alone.

"So, Rimuru-sama, do you have a conclusion?"

"Um, I'm certain now. 'That lord' spoken by Clayman must have been Yuuki Kagurazaka."

"Kufufufufu, my thoughts exactly. The only major hindrance was the lack of evidence, however, it was definitely him."

I answered Benimaru's question with Diablo's agreement. There was no longer any doubt. After hearing Luminas's advice, I was mostly certain about the fact. While I'd reserve my judgement about the other person, Yuuki was no doubt the puppet master.

After all, there were few people that knew about my relationship with Shizu-san. I was wondering who gave the information to Hinata, and she admitted herself that it was the eastern merchants. Moreover, as I was gathering information, I came across something interesting.

"Myuran claimed that she has never heard of the Moderate Clown Troupe."

"Clayman was a conniving demon lord, but he didn't even trust his own subordinates enough to reveal the existence of the clowns."

I nodded to Geld's words.

Indeed, Clayman didn't trust anyone, and so no one knew there were the clown troupe behind the scenes.

"But on the side of the eastern merchants, the result checks out with Shuna's investigation. Clayman seemed to have publicly gone into contact with them. Myuran has seen them a couple of times, she was even a consultant to the merchants."

"Ho, in other words---"

"Have those clowns been disguising themselves as merchants and kept on being in contact with Clayman?"

Geld and Gabil seemed to have understood as they nodded in response.

"Regarding that, Adalmann also provided us with some evidence. The Moderate Clown Troupe seemed to have revealed themselves before him. They didn't disguise themselves as merchants in front of Adalmann and didn't care to hide their tracks."

It was now for certain that the clown troupe appeared near Clayman's base, though no one in the castle had seen them. *In that case, my theory may turn out to be correct.*

"The Moderate Clown Troupe has ties with the eastern merchants, that's gotta be how it is," Diablo's smile deepened as he commented.

"It would also mean that the person that murdered Demon Lord Roy was Laplace. The guy that vanished during the great war."

Benimaru gave off a smirk as he presented his own theory.

We knew that there were three clowns in total, with Footman and Teare acting behind the scenes during the great war. They seemed to be managing majins that were suspected to betray Clayman.

*Under those circumstances, what could the last clown be doing...*

According to Benimaru, we could assume that he invaded Lubelius in search of a certain object.

I nodded and continued:

"Those who knew my relationship with Shizu-san have all been present during the meeting just now. That's why I asked him that one last question."

With the exception of Kabal, Elen and Gido, both Gazel and Elmesia were also off the list. As for Fuze, Veryard and the Blumund Royal Court (the King and Queen), I guess you can say that they've washed themselves of suspicion. Since their connection with the eastern merchants was decidedly minimal. There also wasn't any clear motivation for them.

There was also Hinata, but given the fact that she was almost manipulated, there's no way she was the one behind the scenes.

That left us with Yuuki.

"He has admitted that he has ties with the eastern merchants."

"He couldn't really deny it. For instance, the high-quality paper they use were obviously exported from the Eastern Empire. The fact that Yuuki had plenty in stock meant that there's undoubtedly a tie between him and the eastern merchants."

"Kufufufufu, if he really wants to deny it, we can use this against him. What a missed opportunity."

*A missed opportunity indeed, but you don't have to be too pessimistic.*

I didn't tell anyone unfamiliar to the whole ordeal about my special relationship with Shizu-san. If someone deliberately leaked out such information, it would obviously mean that such a person was hostile towards us. More importantly, the same person was certain that the information would enrage Hinata---that's gotta be Yuuki.

I had my doubts towards other people as well, such as Kabal's party. However, it was thanks to Elen's suggestion that I decided to become a demon lord in the first place. And after learning that she had Emperor Elmesia behind her back, to leak my information to the Eastern Empire would gain her nothing.

Such an important secret must have only been leaked as bait.

The same logic could apply to the people from Blumund. In the hypothetical scenario that they had wished to be hostile towards us, why sign all the treaties. They should have been quietly observing and profiting from the start and wouldn't have tried to find ways to communicate and deepen our relationship.

"I'm afraid that the goal of these eastern merchants may be to expand their influence on the western continent. Is that why they felt that the church was in their way?"

"I think so too. The reason why they had Hinata and Rimuru-sama duel each other was probably to exhaust both of their strength."

"It didn't matter who would win, their goal was very obvious."

Benimaru and Diablo agreed with my views, and so I continued:

"Among the Western Nations, there are the two major powerhouses that are the Council and the Western Holy Church. I believe the eastern merchants have infiltrated both. They were probably thinking about expanding their influence slowly over time. And the organization assisting their goal would be---"

"The Freedom Association?"

Hearing Diablo's response, I nodded deeply.

This was the most likely explanation in terms of motivation.

Although I didn't have any concrete evidence, I was almost certain.

"Well then, what should we do?"

*Let's go kill him right now*---that seemed to be what Diablo was hinting at, *please stop*.

"Let's watch what they will do next, first. Since he has already generously agreed to provide aid, I almost doubted whether my suspicion was misplaced. But we must act cautiously from now on to catch their tails."

"Understood. Then I will be observing the newly built department of the Freedom Association in our town first."

"I'll be counting on you, Souei. And everyone, you must not act on your own!"

" " "Yes sir!" " "

![break]

This would do.

Honestly, I really wanted to just question Yuuki now. But we didn't have any evidence, and he may just run away after spouting out some clever rhetoric. Yuuki was the head of the Freedom Association after all, we couldn't touch him without proof.

*There's also the possibility that I may have misunderstood him.*

<<Answer. The estimated chance for that case is extremely low.>>

*Estimate, you say. I suppose it's the same for Wisdom King Raphael-sensei, even you can't make a definite claim without concrete evidence.*

"Anyhow, in the country I stayed in my past life, there's a principal that protects people who are not guilty. The general gist of it went 'One is innocent until proven guilty.' With that said, please don't put your guard down!"

The lieutenants nodded firmly to my words.

*What was Yuuki thinking---that I have no idea.*

Me, Hinata and Clayman.

Even the eastern merchants, the Freedom Association, or perhaps the Council itself. Everyone had been manipulated by Yuuki.

While we couldn't prove that yet, it wouldn't be the same in the future. Right now, he was a target that had been locked on by us. We just had to prepare quietly before our final confrontation---

![break]

The happy days of the festival had ended.

The busy daily life returned.

There were still tons of things for me to do, and there were still more problems for me to resolve. Right now I had no time to be upset.

The thought that I'd have to put on a mask during my future encounters with Yuuki made me sigh with sadness.
