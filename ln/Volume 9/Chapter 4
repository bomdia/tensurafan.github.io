# Chapter 4: The Final|Round and the|Dungeon Opening

On the third morning of the Founding Festival, I set off to the Dwarven Kingdom in order to exchange our stellars for gold coins.

Now that our problem had been resolved, we would have to see how the conspirators would react. With this done, I had nothing else to worry about, so I could just enjoy the celebration.

We would be starting the day with the final battle between Masayuki and Gobta. The stands were packed with anticipation and people were all enthusiastic about making their predictions about who would be the winner and some even opened up a betting pool.

Myourmiles was hoping to make the most of this by making the only winning play---be the guy running the business. No matter your prediction, you'd still make money. This is the secret to any gambling operation.

I put my money on Gobta, mainly to make some more pocket change, not because I expected to win, however. Yeah, nah. I only put money in due to the enormous return in the event that he was actually successful.

*Cough!*, that was irrelevant. The important thing was to give Gobta my support.

![break]

"NEXT---WE ARE FINALLY ENTERING THE FINAL! WHICH CONTESTANT WILL BE CROWNED THE CHAMPION? WILL IT BE 'SHINING' MASAYUKI, OR THE CHIBI WARRIOR GOBTA, WHO'S FIGHTING FOR HIS PLACE AMONG THE 'FOUR HEAVENLY KINGS'?"

Souka's broadcast was on point as well.

She was praising Gobta relentlessly, making it impossible for him to escape. I wasn't sure if Souka was aware of this herself, but pushing people like this was truly cruel. It was then, that Diablo raised his hand and the arena fell into complete silence.

*What the?* Even some female audience members looked mesmerized... It was best to just not think about it and pretend I saw nothing. If Gobta beat Masayuki, all the problems would be resolved.

But if Masayuki turned out to be just as strong as Hinata, Gobta would have no chance of winning. Ultimately, no matter the outcome, I would be able to obtain some information about that swordsman. If Masayuki fell into a hard battle against Gobta, I could at least confirm that he was not going to pose any threat.

Moreover, Gobta's natural good luck was combined with the presence of Ranga. This was actually quite the ideal circumstance for testing out Masayuki's strength.

Onstage, Souka finished introducing the two contestants smoothly. With that, the match began. All right, time to see what percentage of Masayuki's strength Gobta was going to force him to reveal.

With that thought in mind, I watched intently---

![hard scene break]

Masayuki's head was burning with anxiety.

After watching the battle between Gozer and Mezer yesterday, and knowing that he had to fight against the winning contestant of that match---

*I'm done for. F-fighting against a monster like that. I'm gonna get slaughtered!*

The very thought of the upcoming match made the blood drain from his face.

When he managed to trick Gozer with his speech and got him to give up the match, Masayuki really wanted to praise himself. But upon seeing the match afterward, Masayuki was plunged into despair yet again.

*How am I supposed to win?! What the hell, are all the participants in this martial tournament actual monsters?*

He felt the urge to curse impulsively again. The people he would be fighting against during the final were all monsters even stronger than Gozer. He'd lost his appetite last night, and instead spent the night like a death row inmate awaiting his execution.

*Now that I think about it, everything went all too smoothly.*

The constant praise as a hero---a 'Chosen Hero' no less---and his overconfidence in his companions' abilities, had led him into a complacent mindset. And as a result, Masayuki thought he could have an easy life, with minimal effort, and easily eliminate any hurdles in his way.

To this day, he'd been able to get through all tough situations like that, giving him no reason to question his strength.

---No, he just never bothered to put much thought into it.

Without much proof, he just went around arrogantly believing his squad was invincible and that they could defeat whatever enemies they encountered. It was this thought that kept Masayuki composed internally.

*But...how the hell can I hold on to such an ignorant delusion now? ...I want to run. I want to run away from this place!*

The thought of making a run for it had actually crossed his mind multiple times...

"Yo, Masayuki-san. After winning tomorrow's tournament, are you going to duel the demon lord right after?" Jinrai asked casually, which made Masayuki want to argue back, "What kind of joke was that?"

It was all Demon Lord Rimuru's fault. It was all because of the demon lord's gentle and fragile appearance, that Masayuki let his guard down. Or else he would have acted more cautiously for the sake of self-preservation.

"It's only a matter of time. Masayuki-sama will defeat the demon lord and save this kingdom."

"Before fighting the demon lord, should we perhaps discuss this with Yuuki-san? We should, nonetheless, remain vigilant, despite the easy win today. We don't want to lose tomorrow's match out of carelessness."

"Bernie, my man, how is that even possible?"

"Lion-Mask might have been dangerous, but that hobgoblin named Gobta should be a piece of cake. The match will be over before he can summon that troublesome beast."

*Easy my ass.* Masayuki had absolutely no clue how to fight these enemies. All he could think about was how he was going to get crushed. But after seeing the faith his companions had in him, he couldn't bear to tell them his genuine thoughts. With that being the case, he forced out a simple: "I'll just try my best."

The beginning of the final approached relentlessly. Masayuki went to the toilet several times to avoid pissing himself during the match. He had to make sure his bladder was empty before going on stage.

*UHHHHHH, what do I do? How can I make it back alive??*

The fighter in front of him was daunting. The announcer had called him Gobta earlier. Even Kyu said that the Hobgoblin was nothing, but Masayuki begged to differ.

*Hobgoblin? That's a total lie! Aren't goblins supposed to be the weakest kind of monster? How did he evolve to become so strong?!*

"And now! We will witness the very first Tempest Martial Tournament finale! On one side, we have the fierce warrior, lieutenant of Demon Lord Rimuru and young captain of the goblin riders, Gobta! His opponent, the hero of the western nations, the 'Shining Chosen Hero', Masayuki! What sort of match will they show us---? Turn your sight to the center of the stage---what an intense staredown! The match will begin in---"

Masayuki knew that as soon as she finished her announcement, the match would kick off.

*Damnit, I don't have much time left.*

Even though Masayuki had just relieved himself, he was still on the brink of pissing his pants out of anxiety. If he had had any nerves to spare, he would have kept listening---mainly because he wanted to see what the announcer lady's tail looked like. But right now, Masayuki had neither the time nor spirit.

He instead contemplated his own powers. He considered his Unique Skill 'Chosen One'---this bizarre ability. He recalled hearing a stone-cold voice ringing in his mind, telling him of his Skill. He'd only figured it out recently, but his Skill did seem to have a variety of effects on the people around him.

He found that people would speak in favor of him or praise him without any of his own input, to the point that he was even worshipped as a hero. His entire reputation and title were due to his it. But at the same time, this Skill was completely passive and unalterable, leading him to where he was now---standing before his inevitable doom.

*---Right. Yesterday, when I talked to that monster Gozer, my power worked on him too. Best case scenario, I just gotta make it through this match in one piece and this one might just give up...*

From Masayuki's understanding of it, his Skill made people automatically admire him---he was so confident in this ability, that he would wager his life yet again.

Now having finalized his plan calmed him down a bit. Masayuki then turned towards his opponent. One should call it a coincidence perhaps, but the two happened to cross eyes. Upon close inspection, Masayuki found that his opponent was also sitting anxiously.

*Eh? By the looks of it, maybe I still have a chance...?*

His opponents during the martial tournament held in Ingracia were also like this. They believed that Masayuki was stronger than them, and ultimately let that lead to their own demise. Masayuki had dueled tons of people like that.

Thinking of it that way, perhaps Masayuki had a chance to win this time as well. Upon thinking so, his legs stopped shaking.

*If things go smoothly, perhaps I can win without fighting once again.*

After reclaiming some of his energy, Masayuki hatched a plan. But he would soon realize that this thought was way too naive---

![hard scene break]

"Now then, let the match begin!"

On Souka's command, Gobta was the first one to rush forward.

"Woah---here I come!"

Earlier, I was worrying that Gobta would attempt to forfeit before getting wounded or something, but it seemed such worries were for nothing.

The fishing pole as a reward was a great motivator to Gobta. His face-to-face confrontation with Masayuki was more serious than ever, as he smoothly moved towards the outskirts of the arena, almost sliding. From what I could see, he was planning to use the same tactic from his fight with Karion yesterday, by positioning himself near the edge of the arena.

In contrast to Gobta's extreme caution, Masayuki didn't make a single move. He merely slowly turned towards Gobta and made a "Heh," sound, with a cold smile on his face.

"Ho---so it's true that being more attractive also means that you're stronger! In the face of Gobta's funny antics, Masayuki proves this with his ineffable serenity---"

*What hurtful words*. Hearing this broadcast, not just Gobta, any self-conscious folk would start crying. Masayuki was indeed quite handsome, but she was definitely exaggerating.

"Heh, hehe, just as I thought... From your reaction, I can tell that, no matter what I do, it would be futile. Although I really would like to try and fight you with my strength alone, to see how far I can go... I can see that it probably won't hurt you. So let me try this, my newly acquired ultimate power!"

*Ah, this brat... He was about to be reckless again.*

*That guy was definitely going to mess things up.*

At this point I'd grown tired of stopping him from doing dumb things. But seriously, I really hoped he wouldn't mess around during such formal circumstances.

<<Report. Last night the individual "Gobta" acquired Unique Skill 'Magic Wolf Summon (Give Strength)'. Deduced reason being that the individual "Ranga" intervened forcefully. Extra Skill 'Unification' therefore was combined, and it now seems to be capable of summoning a Magic Wolf to perform Skill 'Unification'--->>

*What? So Gobta learned the Skill 'Magic Wolf Summoning' and is now capable of merging with Ranga? How in the world...? Eh, now that I think about it, Wisdom King Raphael-sensei seemed to be hesitant in saying something, could it have been this?*

<<Regarding the matter--->>

*Regarding what matter?* Raphael-sensei was stuttering, meaning things weren't as simple as they seemed. It was already very strange that Gobta had suddenly gained some powerful ability. It probably came to Gobta's aid and granted him a new Skill.

Confronted with my doubts, Raphael-sensei remained silent. It wouldn't lie to me, but this time it was also unwilling to tell the truth. I could try to force it to answer, but there was no need to go that far.

All in all, things were going in our favor, so I decided to just quietly observe.

![break]

"Allow me to demonstrate! Magic Wolf Unification^[The note Fuse added states this skill is essentially へんしん/変身 (transformation)]!"

As the space around him distorted, Ranga was summoned behind Gobta. Then, Ranga fused with Gobta's body and "Merged" with him. The resulting creature looked nothing like Gobta. To put it simply, they became a bipedal Ranga. Honestly...it looked super cool.

*Damnit, Gobta, of all people, actually got to transform!* I protested internally.

![exact fit image](image10)

"WOAH, WOOOOW! So cool, what is that, that's super-duper cool!" Milim shouted next to me.

She was very excited to see Gobta's transformation. *Uh, I mean, I totally understood*---I never expected someone like Gobta could look so intimidating...

"T-this-! Contestant Gobta's appearance has changed dramatically...?"

"Yes, this is a rare ability that allows one to borrow the power of a summoned beast."

"In other words, Gobta has taken the power of the summoned beast we saw yesterday as his own? That's one impressive skill! This is truly incredible!"

Even Souka's broadcast was full of excitement and joy. Diablo, on the other hand, seemed extremely calm as he answered Souka's questions.

"Does that mean that Gobta can freely utilize Ranga's power?"

"If he can, I'd be impressed. Ranga seems to have handed his autonomy to Gobta, so the two might become an incredibly strong duo."

"Ehhh, but that's Gobta we are talking about."

"Kukuku, Gobta is my disciple after all. While his physique may not be as strong as others, he has fought against majin stronger than himself in the past. Now that he has full reign over Ranga-san's power, he may unlock more of his potential---"

As I muttered, many lieutenants watching the match next to me made their own comments. In addition, the audience were watching nervously.

"Hehe, my turn now!"

*Weren't you the one who struck first?* I thought to myself spitefully. Masayuki didn't even get to do anything.

Before my eyes, Gobta suddenly vanished.

---Correction, I obviously saw him move, but to the eyes of the ordinary person in the crowd, it really looked like he disappeared.

"C-contestant Gobta vanished! Where did he go---?" Souka exclaimed for the audience.

*She could see it as clearly as I could; what a drama queen*. It was right in front of her---

![break]

BOOOOM!

![break]

The battle stage exploded. The impact struck the wall right beneath the audience's seats, the side where our VIP booth happened to be situated, which was also why I got to see things very clearly.

---Gobta spared his opponent a few words before---looking mighty fine in his new form---charging towards him. He was unstoppable---so much so that he managed to sail past Masayuki and run straight into the wall. All of this, I saw with my very own eyes---

It was because of *this* that I opposed Gobta being so reckless. Even if he hadn't done anything yet, I knew that there was a good chance that things would go badly.

"Ara, contestant Gobta isn't getting up, is he all right?"

Gobta was defeated by the wall and passed out instantly. Not to mention, dashing off the stage like that was equivalent to forfeiting anyway, and so he had lost the match.

Gobta didn't know how to control the extent of his strength. He did gain amazing power after merging with Ranga, but he failed to manipulate it competently. Simply speaking, Gobta's "run and stop" fighting style was based on his old physique and didn't account for Ranga's power-up. One second to Gobta was completely different from one second to Ranga. In other words, Gobta didn't manage to "stop" himself before being slammed into the wall---

And just as Souka said, Gobta hadn't gotten up. It wasn't because he was incapacitated by the physical impact, but instead he had passed out due to shock. Not sure what I should say about him...

The handsome look he just gave off, followed by the utter embarrassment on display now. From a certain perspective, the situation could only be described as "A Gobta Thing".

"..."

I seriously was at a loss for words.

"That idiot..." Benimaru yawned.

"That's the Gobta I know," Shion was barely hiding her laughter.

"..." and there was Hakurou, sitting there without a word, as the veins on his forehead were throbbing.

"Hmm---so this is what father dear's disciple is like," Momiji's words only made Hakurou even angrier.

The situation turned super awkward.

All of this was the doing of Gobta himself. The audience in the arena seemed to have only just realized it as well. Among them, some had no idea what had happened and attempted to rationalize Gobta's actions. There was muttering along the lines of:

"Was that a shadowless body slam?"

These words were extra loud in the stunned silence of the arena.

"Y-you have a point. That's the only possibility."

"He sure got some moves, as expected from Masayuki-sama!"

"WOAH, WOOOOAH, so strong, soooo strong!"

"We didn't even see a thing, that was just way too powerful!"

Everyone had praise for Masayuki, and soon the phenomenon spread across the Colosseum. And in the end, people just seemed to take that as the truth, as the arena was filled with thunderous cheers. Even without Souka and Diablo's judgement, the whole place was already celebrating Masayuki's victory---

Next to me, a certain someone was furious to the point of shaking.

"T-that guy... Was he mocking me? How did this happen after he managed to turn into something so cool?!"

For Gobta to have such a cool transformation, yet still turn out to be a major disappointment---it turned all of Milim's previous excitement into murderous rage, all to be unleashed on Gobta.

"C-calm down, will you. Despite how he looks, he has already worked very hard," I offered as defense.

"Rimuru, it does him no good to keep spoiling him like this!"

"Indeed, Rimuru-sama. I have been too loose with Gobta. I shall train him more strictly in the future," Hakurou agreed with Milim.

Maybe it was just me, but the news that Hakurou had "spoiled" Gobta was a first.

"All right! I shall train him personally. Rimuru, give Gobta to me and I will make him an incredible warrior!" Milim's eyes shone beseechingly. It honestly sounded more like she was asking me for some rare Pokémon.

If I nodded and gave my approval, Gobta would suffer in his own brand of hell... On that thought, I recalled something.

"I have something else to entrust you with, actually. If you are willing to accept, I might consider your first offer."

"Okay, shoot."

"The thing is, there are ruins located beneath Clayman's base. I don't think it should be explored in a careless manner. However, they may hold some valuable information about the ancient times. That's why I ordered people to maintain them in their original state."

"Umm."

"I want to investigate that ruin; I hope you can give us the green light."

"Why ask me for it?"

*Because it's your territory now*---I thought to myself.

"Milim, who exactly is running that land right now?" Frey calmly asked Milim, before I could tease her about it.

Prompted by Frey, Milim suddenly straightened her spine and nervously said, "O-oh yeah, that land belongs to me now. Umm, of course I remember something like that!"

At least she remembered that the land was hers.

"Then---"

"Of course it's okay!" she agreed promptly.

Perhaps Milim just wanted to change the topic, but to me, verbal confirmation was good enough; nothing else mattered that much.

Although I did feel a little sorry for Gobta, a good deal is a good deal, I was very satisfied. He was completely useless. He went on to eliminate himself before testing even a single thing on Masayuki, so at least he was useful in this regard. Moreover, Gobta got to be trained by someone, that's one idiot goblin for the price of two.

"By the way, Rimuru. When you go for the investigation, will you bring me along?"

"Umm---that depends. I've actually invited an expert from the Freedom Association. If you think it's fine, you can come along."

"Yeah, I'll look forward to it!"

"Is that so? It may be quite tedious if there turns out to be nothing of interest."

While waiting for the referee's judgement to be pronounced, I discussed the issue with Milim.

![break]

A few minutes passed. Souka and Diablo finally finished their discussion.

"The results are in! While it is worrisome that contestant Gobta has yet to recover, the winner of the match is---"

It was pretty obvious. I was ready for Souka to announce the outcome and for this to be over---

![hard scene break]

"I'll give you a taste of it! Magic Wolf Unification!" Gobta shouted to Masayuki during the standoff.

In that instant, Masayuki realized he had been hopelessly idealistic.

*Hold up! What the hell is that? I've never heard about that skill before!*

With Masayuki unable to stop the summon, Gobta had already turned into a different form.

Masayuki could not have predicted that. His opponent exuded a powerful aura. Even an amateur such as Masayuki could tell that his opponent was the real thing. Even though he heard that there were healing potions prepared for the contestants, he still had no chance.

*Oi! If I get scratched by giant claws like that, my garbage armor will turn straight to scrap. If I'd known this would happen, I wouldn't have turned down wearing that full set of heavy armor...*

That being said, Masayuki was still pretty sure that wearing magisteel over his entire body wouldn't save him anyway, even if it was appealing.

It was then that Gobta shouted, "Heh hehe, my turn now!"

Not waiting for any response from Masayuki, he began to draw energy.

*Hold up, I want to forfeit---!* Masayuki tried to shout. Given how things had developed, Masayuki realized that he needed to put his dignity aside and save his ass first and foremost. Against someone like the transformed Gobta, victory was unimportant for Masayuki. Yet the situation just kept going downhill for him.

Masayuki didn't even get the chance to utter: "I want to forfeit"---

There was already a loud "BOOOOM!" echoing in the arena.

Gobta knocked himself out.

Masayuki didn't even have time to react. He stood there dumbfounded. There was a massive gust of wind and the shockwave sent shrapnel from the stone walls flying everywhere, stinging Masayuki's cheeks. The sense of pain dispelled any illusions that this may have been a dream.

*N-no way... I couldn't have dodged that hit. People seem to be explaining this in my favor, no matter what I do, no one would believe my account of what actually took place. What should I do...*

If this were to continue, Gobta would be disqualified and Masayuki would be the winner. He thought to himself: *What's good about that though?*

What good was winning in a tournament like this?

*Earning the right to challenge a demon lord? Are you kidding?? That would be suicidal!*

Masayuki wasn't dumb. He understood that if he won, he would have to fight Demon Lord Rimuru. Masayuki was no match for the dark wolf that just shot past him, or Lion-Mask among the other contestants. Yet Demon Lord Rimuru was the head of all these majins. To pick a fight with that kind of character would only result in him getting beaten to a pulp.

*Or I will most definitely get killed!*

It was not a matter of whether his Skill worked or not; the two of them were on completely different levels. How could Masayuki beat a demon lord?

*Perhaps I should just admit defeat*---Masayuki made up his mind, concluding that this would be the most appropriate.

*What shadowless body slam?* The chatter from the crowd was really annoying.

If he did nothing, Gobta would be disqualified and lose the match.

Masayuki thought hard---it was the first time in his life that he'd used his brain this much.

*What can I do to lose the match---*

"The results are in! While it is worrisome that contestant Gobta has yet to recover, the winner of the match is---"

*Shit.* Masayuki immediately took action.

"---Hold on," he interrupted.

He was dying of panic inside, yet from the outside, he looked as calm and focused as always.

"What's the matter...?"

Masayuki reached out quietly, to which Souka acquiesced and passed him the microphone.

"For this match, wasn't I the one who lost?" Masayuki posed the question while trying his hardest to suppress his stuttering voice.

"Eh---but, Masayuki-sama," Souka implored rather confused, "no matter how you judged that, it was contestant Gobta who knocked himself out."

"That may be the case. However, I failed to see through his attack. I feel that I still have room for improvement. It is a bit too early for me to challenge the demon lord now---"

Masayuki spoke slowly to avoid fumbling his words while also holding back the nervous sweat. His tone was casual in a way that made his forceful excuse sound natural, in order to be more convincing. Then, Masayuki handed the microphone back and left the stage without a word. He wouldn't reply to any questions. He simply left in silence.

*My power will be at play now. No matter what I say, the audience will make sense of it all by themselves and come up with some explanation. My priority now is to escape the scene...*

This was the first time in Masayuki's life that he focused this much on simply moving his feet. And so, Masayuki elegantly escaped from his life's greatest crisis yet.

![hard scene break]

Masayuki suddenly announced his own defeat after Gobta's clearly self-induced KO.

"What's this guy thinking?"

"Uh---no idea."

"There's no way he would actually be afraid of Gobta. Could there be some other motive?"

Benimaru and Shion were entrenched in confusion as they watched Masayuki leave the stage.

*Was this kid bluffing? Or did he have some other plan?*

Alas, I wouldn't get any answers even if I used up all of my brain juice. But since Masayuki gave up the chance to fight me, everything worked out fine in the end.

The spectators were also perplexed. People started speaking up in confusion:

"...Does he plan to hide his real strength in front of the demon lord?"

"No no no, he did just use the incredible shadowless body slam skill."

"Although he said that he didn't manage to see through the attack, he didn't even get a scratch!"

"No, he actually got a scratch on his face..."

"What did you say? Did Masayuki-sama's face get cut---?!"

The crowd erupted into discussion.

"I see, I finally got it!"

It was then that a certain man shouted and turned the situation around.

"Was Masayuki-sama giving the demon lord some time to decide?"

"What does that mean?"

"Demon Lord said that he wanted to live with us in peace, doesn't everyone know about this?"

"That goes without saying."

"Of course!"

"With that being the case, surely Masayuki was doing it to warn Demon Lord Rimuru," that man said smugly. His surprisingly convincing speech kinda pissed me off. Yet probably because of that, more and more people started to support the idea.

And in the end---

"I see, I finally understand, now that you've put it this way. Masayuki-sama did not draw his sword this time either."

"You've got sharp eyes, that's right. Masayuki-sama must have wanted to relay the message that he could have won this kind of tournament at any moment!"

"I see! Surely, he also made the implication to the demon lord that he wouldn't sit idly by in the face of any wrongdoing, right?"

"That's it. However, even if he were really fighting the demon lord, he would probably spare his life, even after defeating him."

"He doesn't even mind the impact on his reputation... H-he is truly a magnificent man!"

"That's rad! As expected from Masayuki-sama."

"Right, he's so handsome!"

Much like this, people began to justify his actions with all these bizarre explanations.

At some point, for some reason, everyone began to praise Masayuki.

"MA-SA-YU-KI, MA-SA-YU-KIIII!"

Why were they chanting? What was this? Some sort of religion?

This kind of creeped me out.

In response to their support, Masayuki raised an arm as he left. His movement was very rigid, which caught my attention.

But honestly, this Masayuki guy was really something else. Why was he praised by everyone like that?

<<Answer. It is possible that the individual "Masayuki Honjou" possesses the effect of a Unique Skill.>>

Just as I was convinced of the fact that some unexplainable phenomenons just happen in this world, Wisdom King Raphael-sensei proceeded to set me straight. It was experienced enough at this point that it analyzed Masayuki for me.

Masayuki's Skill seemed to be the kind that had special effects on people. People under its influence would be manipulated both in terms of thought process and emotion.

The reason as to why Masayuki had given up the championship must have been because he had witnessed Gobta's power. This was just my guess, but since he was able to trick and convince Gozer to give up, based on that alone, it was likely that Masayuki didn't think he was able to win against Gozer.

Based on this, now that I recalled Masayuki's fighting style, would it even be possible for him to react to his enemy's move at all? No wonder he never drew his weapon. In conclusion, Masayuki's own combat ability must not have been that great to begin with, or at least something along those lines. Even Hinata wasn't able to tell how strong Masayuki was, which was natural, considering how weak he was anyway.

With that being said, he still should not be underestimated. After all, he had a huge amount of influence, and antagonizing him would just bring trouble. These kinds of people simply couldn't be overlooked, and thus I felt the need to establish a good relationship with him.

In order to achieve this goal, I planned to say something along the lines of, "Kukuku, I know your little secret," to threaten Masayuki---just kidding. Masayuki was likely wracking his brain on how to deal with Gozer during their match, especially since he couldn't run away in front of his companions. I'd talk to him later, and comfort him about his hard work. After which I would propose future cooperation.

I could cleverly advertise Masayuki as a chosen hero and use him to promote the labyrinth.

"Souei! Please send a message to Masayuki. Tell him that I wish to meet him."

"Understood!"

"Please be very cautious about this, invite him to have lunch with me afterward."

I did want to speak with him, mainly because we were both Japanese. I also planned to ask Hakurou to make us some sushi. Hopefully, things would go well.

![break]

While I was thinking about Masayuki, Gobta seemed to have regained consciousness. Souka and Diablo renewed their judgement and decided to accept Masayuki's proposal.

"Although there were a series of unexpected incidents throughout, due to the forfeit of contestant Masayuki, the winner of the tournament is Gobta!"

The arena was awash with dissatisfaction. No wonder. The final that everyone had been so hyped for, ended up with Gobta's self-elimination. In addition, Masayuki quit after the match. It was only natural that these paying customers would want their money back.

But they were the minority after all. Since Masayuki himself accepted the result, the crowd didn't really have many complaints against me.

Gobta's abilities were already recognized by most people. I supposed that this was also one of the reasons why there weren't waves of complaints at the scene. That being said, the bad rap Gobta had for a conniving personality didn't fade. Everyone seemed to think that he was a despicable man.

"Come, contestant Gobta! How do you feel right now?"

"Eh, eh? Is this real? Am I really the champion?"

"Indeed. Gobta's active involvement in the match has truly been phenomenal!" Souka praised, inflating his ego.

*...You were seriously able to say that with a straight face. All Gobta did was charge into a wall and get himself knocked out.*

![break]

All in all, the final match ended.

I personally came onstage and commemorated each contestant. I spoke with all eight of them and commended their excellent performance.

As for Masayuki's companion Jinrai, as promised, I rewarded him with the newly made armor. Gai, upon seeing this, grumbled that he wanted one too. But since I never made such a deal with him, I proceeded to ignore him.

Masayuki's answer to Souei, on the other hand, was "I'll come." He looked quite determined (to face his demise)---did he misunderstand something?

Anyhow, I'd resolve the misunderstanding when we sat down and talked.

The last Contestant was Gobta.

"Nice job, Gobta. From now on, I officially appoint you as one of the 'Four Heavenly Kings'!"

While I was surprised by the way the matches had developed, a win was still a win. And as promised, Gobta would become one of the "Four Heavenly Kings".

He was probably the best candidate for a pin-up. Even if he lost a fight, all we had to say was: "Kukuku, this guy is the weakest of the Four Heavenly Kings, the disgrace of the Four Heavenly Kings!"

He was so fit for that role. The thought of it gave me shivers.

"Thank you! I'll work hard in the future as well!"

And so, the first Tempest Martial Tournament concluded smoothly.

---I wish.

![break]

Gobta's personal hell had only just begun.

"Are you done yet? Hand him over! We need to train!" Milim crowed at me with a sharp smile after returning to the VIP booth.

"Um, just remember to hold back a little."

"Relax, we'll be in the labyrinth. He'll be resurrected after death!"

Milim's face was a parody of a smile.

*Oh yeah, that was a thing...* I wasn't sure if that was of any comfort to Gobta though. But there's one thing I could say for certain, that is, he was gonna die very horribly---he couldn't even get away after death; that thought alone was chilling.

"Gobta, how about we have a little chat over there?"

Milim walked straight up to Gobta and lifted him with a single hand.

"AHH!"

That vice grip of hers was pretty intense, enough to bring out a squeal.

Milim's continued smiling, though it didn't reach her eyes.

"I congratulate you for your victory, but it looked so lame, so I don't approve of it. That's why I'm training you personally!"

Gobta's transformation must have really blown her away, but his awkward display later made her furious.

YOU ABUSED MY EXPECTATIONS AND EXCITEMENT---I could almost hear her anger.

"Don't worry. I'll personally fight against you; you'll get stronger right away!"

"Huh, Milim-sama? I never asked you for the favor!" Gobta panicked.

But I doubted that Milim cared about his opinion.

"Gobta, this is a fine opportunity, so you should train hard with Milim-sama."

Hakurou gave Gobta the ultimatum with an extremely charming smile.

"M-mentor, you seriously sold me---"

"Shut up already!"

Gobta was about to complain before he was silenced by Milim's iron fists.

*How brutal.*

"Hehehe, let's not say something like that. It could be misunderstood. Gobta, this is all for your own good," Hakurou told him. I doubt Gobta was listening though.

No matter how you see it, this was probably all because Gobta embarrassed Hakurou in front of Momiji, driving Hakurou to retaliate. It definitely was *not* for Gobta's own good.

And so, Gobta was taken away by Milim.

![break]

Oh and there was the other one.

"My master, I've aided Gobta-san in achieving victory with style!"

Ranga rushed to me, having abandoned Gobta almost immediately. This reaction was all too normal, after all, Ranga didn't want any part in what was in store for Gobta.

But unfortunately, he wasn't able to escape Milim's grasp either.

"Hold on, are you the one called Ranga? Without you, Gobta's training won't be complete!"

"!" *Sad puppy eyes.*

*Sorry, when Milim makes a decision, she refuses to listen to anyone else's advice.* In addition, Ranga entered the match behind my back; I suppose he did this to himself. That's why there was no need for me to intervene.

"WAHAHAHA! I'm not gonna hurt you, just relax!"

With this, Milim dragged both Ranga and Gobta away.

Seriously, Gobta relied on luck too much sometimes. And Ranga as well, he was too used to fighting with his instincts. If they both trained hard to synergize with each other, that "Transformation" would prove to be quite an amazing power.

Milim must have realized, sparking her desire to train them both. I hoped they would abide by their training and learn some actual skills. I looked forward to Gobta having a decent performance by the end of it.

I would have Milim train them in the future.

So long, Gobta.

So long, Ranga.

I'll forever remember your martial prowess!

Rest in peace in the other world.

![hard scene break]

Next up was lunch time, and my chance to dine with Masayuki did come to fruition.

That would be an exaggeration: I just wanted to talk with him and so I ordered the others to wait in the other room. Although Masayuki's companions were reluctant, Masayuki was able to convince them personally.

"N-nice to meet you, is that the right greeting to use? I am Masayuki Honjou, and I get called 'Shining' or 'Chosen Hero'..."

Masayuki called himself a 'Chosen Hero' while blushing.

Hmm, based on the vice of my original world, there was nothing more shameful than calling yourself a 'Chosen Hero' (Yuusha). It was almost as embarrassing as calling himself an empty-headed single-cell creature to be mocked and laughed at.

Moreover, Masayuki seemed to be really concerned about my reaction when we first met. Even though it was mostly his companions who were adding to the tension at the time, he did arrogantly claim to be able to defeat me. For this reason, he seemed quite embarrassed now.

I was the demon lord, after all. Masayuki must have been filled with fear at the thought of facing off against an opponent he knew he was no match for.

Considering this, the current mood was rather complicated. But worrying about this would be unnecessary. I personally decided to let the past go.

As long as he was willing to eat the food I ordered for this occasion, we would be able to settle this grudge.

"About that, I'm not meeting you for the first time anyway. You don't really have to say 'nice to meet you.' I'm Demon Lord Rimuru, my original name was Satoru Mikami. I used to be a salary-man," I confessed openly. It was mainly to help Masayuki relax a bit since he was still unable to touch his food. It has been a long time since I'd last used this discarded name. I felt surprisingly calm about it. I had no intention of hiding this, however, it was just that I hadn't had much chance to use that name since.

"---Eh? Could it be...that you were Japanese?" Masayuki looked unconvinced.

*That's pretty normal, I suppose. I look like a cute girl, so he had little reason to believe me.*

"I guess. We should talk about it while we eat."

Following my prompt, Masayuki finally picked up his chopsticks.

"Eh, this...can I really eat it?"

"Of course. I specifically asked the chefs to prepare some Japanese cuisine for you."

Today's dishes were sushi and tempura---the dishes that even Hinata was moved about eating, and I hoped that Masayuki would be pleased by it as well. He didn't attend the night gala, so I guessed that he hadn't seen any sushi for a long time.

"Could this be my last supper---"

"Not at all. You seem to be quite easy-going. I want to be friends with you."

Masayuki seemed confused about the delicacies in front of him, fearing that this may be his last meal. Even after I told him that I was Japanese, he still seemed to have his doubts.

"T-then, thanks for the meal---"

"Please eat, thanks for the meal."

Masayuki finally began to dine with me. With one scoop of rice in his mouth, Masayuki suddenly fell silent. His expression changed and he began shoveling food out of his bowl with the chopsticks as if he'd been starving for days.

Since Masayuki was busy eating, it wasn't the best time for me to interject. I had to wait for him to finish lunch.

![break]

As soon as he finished, however, Masayuki exclaimed: "I get it now. Please let me be Mikami---no, Rimuru-san's subordinate!"

![break]

*What did Masayuki get?* I had no clue. But, from what I could tell, he just wanted to eat Japanese cuisine. I didn't even say anything, but Masayuki probably had thought about it himself.

"My subordinate? I mean..."

"No, it's okay. I don't miss the title of Chosen Hero at all. I used to hear people calling me 'Chosen Hero Masayuki' and things like that all the time; it was so embarrassing. Like, seriously, I was worried about how to get myself out of this bad spot anyway."

And so he revealed the big scoop to me. Masayuki proceeded to share his story, and I listened intently, quietly drinking tea.

Masayuki, in the original world, was a top student in a famous school known for its high graduation rate. He also had some lesser known hobbies, such as reading manga and light novels. Masayuki thought that all of this (isekai) happened because he was too much of an otaku.

"My power seems to be some Unique Skill called 'Chosen One'? Seriously, what kind of joke is that..."

It seemed that he desired being a hero too strongly and ended up in this world.

Masayuki's Unique Skill 'Chosen One' had a pretty obvious effect. It had the ability to induce suggestive ideas on the surrounding crowd, akin to brainwashing. The ultimate goal of the Skill was to make Masayuki the hero character. It also ignored Masayuki's own wishes, so even if he begged it to stop, the effect still remained.

*Should I call it useful or useless...*

"But your power is truly strong. If you hadn't forfeited, you would have been the champion."

The effect it had during the tournament was the real deal. The winner was supposed to be Masayuki.

"That's right, but that is also what's been bugging me. I didn't do anything to begin with, yet everyone started to misunderstand... That's how I won in Ingracia too," Masayuki explained himself---that was why he got in over his head.

During the defeat of the crime syndicate, 'Slave Trade Union', he was also only there to receive the credit and didn't do anything himself. Masayuki had no choice in the matter, even if he tried. I suppose living this way seemed easy enough, yet this time Masayuki recognized that one misstep could get him killed. Which was why he decided to change strategy temporarily.

In my opinion, it was the right choice, mainly because the effect of 'Chosen One' would probably be---

<<Answer. When confronted with an Ultimate Skill, most lower Skills will be rendered ineffective.>>

*Indeed. It would be rendered useless against me.*

I had planned on giving him a chance from the start, but I didn't expect him to be such an amateur. I could have easily sent Masayuki to kingdom come with just one punch.

"You made the right choice. I think you should be proud of that!"

"Really? I didn't even expect that guy, Gobta, to be able to transform---especially into something that vicious. I could tell just by common sense that I didn't stand a chance."

I didn't believe that was fully accurate. After all, many people with undisputed strength sought to challenge Masayuki in the past. But with that being said, Masayuki did make the right choice this time.

![break]

We continued to chat about various topics, learning about each other's circumstances. Even though I only mentioned a bit about my own life, I learnt a lot about Masayuki's story from then on.

Masayuki's companions treated him like a god, so he couldn't talk to them frankly or genuinely. If he wanted to complain about anything, he would have to find Yuuki. But the latter was a busy person after all, and the two couldn't find time to make an appointment. So the pressure and displeasure grew with time.

Even though I didn't ask, he still retold his story from start to finish in detail.

"Right, I wanted to talk with you a bit more, but the lunch break is about to end. Allow me to ask, what do you plan to do next?"

"Plan for what?"

"Nothing much, but didn't you promise Gozer to battle him again? How about you go and challenge the dungeon?"

"AH!"

By the looks of it, Masayuki had forgotten all about that promise. He was planning to just pretend the whole ordeal had not transpired...

"W-what should I do?"

"Relax. Gozer is in charge of guarding underground level 50. The dungeon is massive, just walking there would take a couple of days alone."

"I-I see your point, so I should just pretend to challenge the labyrinth and just get a pass for today, right?"

"That's right. Since the invited guests are expected to return to their home country tomorrow."

The celebration was estimated to last three days. We predicted that the streets would be filled with people tomorrow, and that, by that time, our main job would be to direct the traffic. We'd be wrapping things up the day after tomorrow. We would start cleaning up by the time we guessed all the guests would have left.

We were only planning to show the public section of the dungeon for the sake of our guests, a.k.a. a preview opening. It wasn't available for the public until it was officially opened. That meant that it would only be open for a mere few hours until nightfall. That should only be enough to take care of the upper levels.

In addition, I did have some ideas for the duel between Gozer and Masayuki. While it may suck for Gozer, it would be troublesome if Masayuki were defeated. This was a rare opportunity after all; I wanted to exploit Masayuki as a tourist attraction. In leading the expedition team to the labyrinth, Masayuki would be able to rile up challengers, provoking their fighting spirits.

"At least, that's how I think. I would like you to help us advertise. What do you think?"

"I see, that does sound very reassuring. Is that why you gave Jinrai that god-tier armor? As long as I won't die if I fail, that sounds interesting!" Masayuki agreed without hesitation to help me out.

![break]

In all honesty, I didn't actually have this in mind when I gifted Jinrai the armor, but it was more convenient like this anyway, since going into the labyrinth without chest armor would no doubt be suicidal.

"I'll sneak some walkthrough guides to you, so you can get through quickly and easily. Moreover, if you find anything that needs changing or anything like that, please tell me."

I had gone through the fifty lower levels' design meticulously, which was why I was not going to give any information about the lower levels. I reminded Masayuki of this and that he should be mindful of it. That being said, if they had their items in hand, they wouldn't die. So there shouldn't be an issue.

"I get it! I'm like a beta tester."

"Uh... Now that you've mentioned it, yes you are. Anyhow, you don't have to force yourself too much, let's go for five levels today."

*Video games. That's an interesting point of view.*

"Okay. It was so nice to finally talk to you, Rimuru-sama. I don't feel as nervous anymore, and I don't feel that the world is that bad now after all," Masayuki said with a relieved smile.

![break]

He seemed to be quite reliant on his Skill, but still held his doubts. My promising aid would help alleviate those worries.

After all, our kingdom was at the forefront in terms of culture. We had established high-quality bathhouses and toilets, and the comfort level of our hotels was also far superior to other nations. Even Masayuki seemed shocked by the variety and deliciousness of the food.

"We have a music band and painting classes for whoever's interested. I've also planned to introduce drama shows later on. I look forward to these myself as well, so I'm not limiting the budget on it."

"Rimuru-san, I'm really impressed by you! Do you happen to have manga as well---?"

"Kukuku, of course, Masayuki. Although you still have a long way till reaching that part, so if you give up midway, it's game over for you!"

"UWOWOWO! I will follow Rimuru-san to the end of the earth!"

![break]

In the end, Masayuki decided to stay longer. I planned to stay in contact with him in private and share information. I noted that I should go chat with him more in the future. I wanted to hear more stories about the other world that I missed.

I also promised him to dig memories of manga from his head as well. Masayuki was also very interested in my collection; I was certain we could be good friends in the future.

And with that, I got a new companion.

![hard scene break]

We were finally demonstrating the dungeon to the public.

As a precaution, I went to confirm some things before it went public. After reaching the lobby at the bottom of the labyrinth, Ramiris, currently full of energy, flew and rested on my shoulder.

"We are going live in a moment, how're the preparations?"

"Hmph! Who do you take me for?" Ramiris scoffed.

From the next room, a smug-looking Veldora entered as well.

"GA-HAHAHA! Don't worry, Rimuru. I'm as reliable as it can get!"

*Oh shit, that made me nervous.*

"Oi oi oi, are you guys really all right? We can't make any mistakes during today's public tour!"

"Hehehe, chill out! You can count on me! We are switching on all sorts of safety measures."

"Kukuku, but! Today is the day that the demonic labyrinth awakes!"

Ramiris and Veldora grinned evilly at each other.

Were there really no issues? For some reason I felt uneasy...

"I'll say this one more time, very seriously. The labyrinth will be shut down again soon."

"W-what?!"

![exact fit image](image11)

*Seriously, what kind of reaction was that?*

I'd explained this several times, but Veldora still hadn't caught up.

I planned to oversee the situation and adjust the difficulty accordingly. That was why the labyrinth would be shut down for two to three days before reopening again.

We also hadn't settled on certain issues for the labyrinth. This included pricing of entry tickets, as well as items such as the 'Labyrinth Card' to permit entry into the labyrinth. We also had yet to employ trained staff to run the facility.

Given how busy we were lately, we had no time to train such workers. I only planned to discuss such problems with Myourmiles in the aftermath of the festival.

Now that I really thought about it, handing control of the labyrinth to those two wasn't such a good idea. I was originally going to do it myself, but Ramiris and Veldora were having fun running it and I was too busy. They weren't listening carefully during the meeting either.

I could feel and relate to their anxiety towards the festival, which is why I wasn't mad at them.

![break]

"It's all right, just stay calm, you guys. I'll do what I can to get it running officially soon. You can enjoy yourselves when that happens."

"Okay!"

"I have faith in you, Rimuru!"

*This should do it.*

It looked like we could make it through today just fine.

*Oh yeah, I almost forgot.*

"By the way, did Milim drop by?"

"She did."

"Hmm, she came back and forcefully took two unlimited 'Revival Bracelets'."

"Is that so? I heard that she was preparing levels 96 to 99. Those were the magic dragon cabins with geographic effects."

"Yeah, she really put a lot of thought into it."

"Um um, there were also those dragons Milim caught---she gave me all their commanding rights! She told me that if I take care of them well enough, they will eventually evolve into dragon lords, which means they will have enough intelligence to understand my orders!"

Ramiris seemed to be quite happy, to the point of claiming: "Turns out Milim does have some merit after all---"

![break]

Some time ago, Milim came back with dragons and scared the living daylights out of everyone. The first two times, people complained, but from the third time onward, they got used to it. The residents no longer panicked over it, but instead accepted it as part of their daily routine.

Milim caught four dragons in total---a fire dragon, ice dragon, wind dragon and earth dragon. They were supposedly elemental archdragons, but they had the intelligence of livestock. Apparently, they could be raised like pets and even communicate with people.

"Oh---do those four also wear neck braces?"

"For now, they are my adorable servants; I'll solidify the master-servant relationship with them in the future too!"

I see, Ramiris had already planned it all out.

Then it was settled. Back to the main issue.

"Milim is staying at the Dragon's Den^[ドラゴン部屋, this essentially means "Dragon Cabin" but editor suggested it "sounded lame".], right?"

"Um, she's afraid that my servants won't get enough exercise, so she got them some playmates!"

"She brought that lad we went fishing with, I think. Not sure why he's playing with dragons though."

*You're better off not knowing.*

I only wanted to learn Milim's location. As long as she stayed at the bottom of the labyrinth, she'd pose no threat to the demonstration.

"Got it. Then she won't come meddling with things, so that's all right. We are opening the labyrinth soon, you coming to the VIP room?"

"Um! I want to go."

"I'm gonna pass. It is the duty of the king of the Labyrinth to await his challenger!"

*...I mean, of course it'd be great if someone got here in one day! You won't get any guests for a couple of days even.*

---Okay, it's not as nice to say it out loud.

"Is that so? I understand. Good luck with that then!"

I encouraged Veldora and 'Teleported' with Ramiris to the VIP room.

![hard scene break]

With the lunch break over, a huge crowd returned to the audience seats.

Ramiris and I hurried to the VIP booth as well.

"Welcome back, Rimuru-sama," Diablo welcomed me with a smile.

![break]

His duties as a referee had concluded, and it seemed that he had been searching for me for a while. I nodded lightly in response, already ready to confirm whether all matters were in place.

Soon we would be opening the dungeon to the public, and there were many last-minute plans to work out after this. This was one of our biggest projects, that would eventually become one of the pillars of our nation. We hoped it would be able to attract even more guests in the future.

Luckily, no one had gone back to their home country after the noon break. The VIP booth had also almost filled up, so we had sufficient publicity.

Looking at the guest hotel, Souka and Myourmiles were standing there. Myourmiles and Diablo were taking shifts as receptionist and broadcaster.

It was time. I signaled the two discreetly.

![break]

At the center of the stage, Myourmiles stood with a microphone. He looked a bit more rigid as opposed to Souka, but still put up quite the show. The content of his broadcast was---

"All right, the time is now! There is one last activity that we wish to introduce to you all during our three-day Founding Festival."

"Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to have kept you waiting. The facility that we are about to demonstrate is the pride of the Tempest Federation, the extremely challenging dungeon. It will be the most difficult undertaking opened by his Majesty, Demon Lord Rimuru to fellow adventurers. Will anyone be able to successfully break through this labyrinth---?"

![break]

While it was okay to hold a demonstration meeting, the dungeon by itself was too dangerous for a bunch of humans to enter.

There were several hundred noblemen alone. In addition to the residents from the neighboring town, there were more than one thousand people in total. With all these people coming in, we didn't have enough personnel to guide them properly.

Therefore, I came up with the idea to use a giant screen to broadcast the walkthrough progress of multiple teams.

However, there were problems on the technical level---

The live feed of the martial tournament was viewed clearly by the audience with the help of the giant viewing screen. The screen was set up with a projector that played the footage on the screen. It was a device developed by Vesta and Gabil and could be used on many different occasions. The recent battles had also been projected on the screen. It used a crystal ball within the projector that had photographic properties. The crystal ball also had engravings for magic communication. This way, when it took videos from far away, it could project it live at the scene.

In this way, the spectators were able to watch the challengers' every move from a safe distance as entertainment. Things would devolve quickly if any prominent figures here were to get hurt. In light of this, we made sure that only representatives capable of safely exploring the labyrinth were able to experience it.

![break]

"Now then, we shall be recruiting challengers here! Which warriors wish to challenge our nation's pride, the Dungeon?" Souka announced, ecstatic. As she called for challengers, we began to move as well.

Ramiris followed suit, flying off my shoulder and summoning the illusion gate leading to the labyrinth at the center of the stage. All you actually needed to do was just walk down the stairs, but our demonstration was all about dramatizing things.

" " "OHOOOOH!" " "

See, just as we predicted, the audience was enthused as well.

At the same time, while many spectators were very excited, the adventurer visitors were all observing each other's next move.

This time we were only open to volunteers, but still we hoped to use the opportunity to accumulate intrigue. Even if no one wanted to volunteer, we still had Masayuki's squad to back us up. That was the main reason why I invited Masayuki to lunch: in order to convince him to be one of the challenging parties. Masayuki had since convinced his companions and were waiting to come up on stage.

In order to prevent any accidents, I gave him the map of floors one to five. Hopefully, he was a competent propagandist.

The question was if there would be any other challengers---

"Hehe, this demon lord's labyrinth probably ain't real, we'll show you! And that over-exaggerated martial tournament as well, all those matches must have been pre-planned. You think you can trick us into bowing down to ya---I won't stand for that!"

"That's right! Basson-aniki has a point!"

"If the street wasn't as crowded then, Basson-aniki would have definitely won the tournament!"

"Hehehe, did you forget about me?"

"Don't say that, Gomez. These people know you're strong as well. With us working together, our team 'Heavy Thunder' is invincible!"

*Huh? I was wondering who came forth. They were challengers?*

It seemed that this man called Basson missed the tournament because he arrived late. But in reality, he could probably tell the contestants' abilities just by watching the matches... Although the quality of each match greatly differed, given that some contestants forfeited.

There were probably more people like Basson who thought they were the strongest. But honestly, that was fine. There were always people who just couldn't accept reality. These people would be our future customers (as fat sheep to be slaughtered).

"'Chosen Hero' Masayuki wasn't that big a deal after all. I recognize his strength, but he wasn't man enough to finish his opponent and gave the demon lord of this nation some time to think over, how incredibly naive. He makes me sick!"

*Ah, um, technically, he did recognize Masayuki's* "*strength*"*...*

"This whole labyrinth is just a joke; Basson and I will show you what really lies beneath!" Basson and his party guffawed arrogantly.

"How dare you offend Rimuru-sama like that; unforgivable."

"Allow me to go silence them---"

"Stop it!"

How very careless of me.

Shion was already pissed off, Diablo, on the other hand, was on the brink of losing control.

I stopped them immediately, though it was already worth celebrating that they didn't mention anything about killing these people.

"They're just over-confident. These kinds of people will make things more fun."

Although I felt that they were pretty moronic myself, we just needed them for a little longer---hearing this, both Shion and Diablo accepted. I was getting better at dealing with them.

The bald warrior Basson.

The black-cloaked mage Gomez.

Plus another four goons.

I decided to let these six be the first batch of challengers.

What followed was a group of unexpected characters.

A trio jumped out and shouted, "We want to challenge it as well!"

![break]

*Where have I seen them before---? Eh, was that Elen's party?*

I thought those three were helping Youm rebuild his country. I told them to report to the Freedom Association at the old Farmus and help out Youm.

B-Ranked adventures already possessed quite a lot of authority, and Elen's party had, in fact, leveled up to Rank B-plus. They were authorized to take on missions, regardless of borders. They hadn't come along with Youm, so I thought they must have gone back to their hometown...

I didn't expect them to have planned such things. It must have been done in secret, fearing an objection from Duke Elalude.

"Are we seriously gonna do it?"

"Of course we are. We haven't done much adventuring lately---this is our chance!"

"Speaking of it, do I, *the captain*, get to decide anything? Anything at all?"

"Of course not, it's already settled!"

*How reckless. Poor Kabal.*

I could just about hear Duke Elalude screaming from the next room, followed by a *thump* sound before everything fell silent again. It wasn't hard to imagine what happened there, but I won't. I hoped Elen and her friends could exit the scene before Elalude threw another tantrum.

![break]

The third to enter was our Masayuki-kun. He walked onto the stage casually and smiled towards the audience.

"MA-SA-YU-KI, MA-SA-YU-KIIII!" There was a wave of cheers.

*Enough already, we get it. He's popular.*

Counting Masayuki, his squad had four people in total. Jinrai had switched out of his shoddy armor into the set I gifted him. It was a magical silver armor that covered his whole body, crafted by Garm. It was high-end rare armor.

While it was heavier than the skeleton full-body armor Youm wore, it had lower quality and durability. However, it was fancy enough to have a poison gas purification effect.

I also gifted Masayuki a rapier. When I asked him why he never drew his sword, Masayuki casually explained, "Because...it was too heavy..." Even I got scared for him, hearing that. *Was he seriously all talk no walk?*

Apparently, he had practiced Kendo before, but a real sword was always much heavier. Especially in this world, sword-fighting trends were unlike the slashes of a katana. Instead, the mainstream use of swords was to execute heavy chops. Thus there needed to be some weight to the swords. It was already very tiring for Masayuki to hold a sword in a fixed position for a long time.

I told him to at least practice a little bit, so I handed him a relatively light rapier. It was a failed recreation when I was preparing a gift for Hinata. Its weight and tenacity were almost as good as the original rapier, however, it was unsuccessful in recreating the special ability of "killing the opponent in the seventh attack".

It was already difficult for him to lift this sword, so even if it didn't have any high-end skills, it would be fine. The sword did, however, have the ability to reduce fatigue. Masayuki only needed to swing it around for show. That rapier was more than sufficient.

Speaking of which, no one else noticed that they'd changed their gear, and instead all four were just showered in applause.

The time limit was three hours. From my calculations, they could, at most make it to the fifth level.

Masayuki's party also had maps, so they had an edge over the other teams. They had all the support needed to help advertise.

![break]

Finally, we had three teams.

Although I felt that this number was small in size, considering that the task was to investigate a suspicious labyrinth of the demon lord, a lot of people were probably hesitating.

We'd have to rely on today's promotional event to get rid of their unease.

Then, it was about time---

"Hold on, I'm participating too."

As these words were spoken, a man in black appeared on the stage.

It was Gai the 'Splendacious Sword Fighter'.

"You made me fall for your tricks with your boring feints and shameful schemes. Fufufu, that's all you're capable of as a demon lord's lackey and one of those despicable 'Four Heavenly Kings'. I know you are afraid of my true power, how very naive of you to try and trick me. No matter what kind of conspiracy you have, I'll crush it!"

I was just wondering why he came. How perfectly timed.

It seemed that he was unable to accept the fact that he was knocked out by Ranga and thought he'd fallen into some sort of trap. He probably also thought that I had some ulterior motive for opening the labyrinth and had come out to stop me.

I did have some other intention, but not what he thought.

"This time allow me to give him a thorough---"

"Um, go ahead, Diablo."

"To do what? Also, Shion, stop trying to imitate my tone!" I huffed.

*These two... Seriously, why were they acting like this?*

They seriously didn't hold back against people who spoke negatively about me. Shion's tricks had been piling on at this point; I really needed to start figuring out some countermeasures.

Anyhow, that aside, Gai had actually chosen to go solo apparently. Was that okay...?

There was no use for me to worry anyway.

From another point of view, I could also make him an example for people wanting to go into the labyrinth alone.

And so, Gai was our fourth challenger.

![hard scene break]

With the challengers gathered on schedule, it was time to get started.

The highly anticipated dungeon had finally opened.

We didn't have a lot of time, so we would stream the labyrinth walkthrough with multiple parties advancing at the same time. Souka would stay back and broadcast the livestream with feeds of different teams.

The Dryads were perfect for the role of receptionist inside the labyrinth. They would also serve as the magic communicators (camera crew), moving with each team.

Apart from Treyni's sisters Trya and Triss, there were also other dryads, albeit few in number. They were still young and inexperienced in battle. However, they still possessed highly abundant mana. Now, with Ramiris in charge, they were the best candidates to manage the labyrinth.

"Then---these four will be the managers of the labyrinth. Normally you won't be assigned with any challengers, however, you will need to relay information about everyone's walkthrough progress, so every team will be assigned with one as follower."

Souka read out their names as they began to greet everyone.

They were Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. It was inconvenient for them not to have names, so I named them randomly. That being said, it didn't consume any of my magicules. Since Dryads were higher monsters, they only consumed their own magicules. These people were Ramiris's subordinates after all, I only needed to help name them.

By the way, these sisters looked quite similar to each other, it was hard to differentiate them by eyesight alone.

Monsters, surprisingly enough, used the wavelength of their mana to differentiate individuals, which was difficult for humans. Partly due to this reason, I had to name them in order to make it easier to recognize them.

![break]

"If you run into any difficulty, just ask them for help! Now we are going to talk about rules! First of all, here is something for everyone!"

Souka held up a few items to demonstrate to everyone as Alpha distributed the same things to each person.

"These are the items that will be sold when people enter the labyrinth. Has everyone got their items?"

Followed by Souka's words, each item was shown and enlarged on the screen. In times like this, having a projector was also particularly convenient.

The items shown were ten high-grade healing potions, one full healing potion, a 'Resurrection Bracelet ' and a 'Return Whistle'.

Since we wanted everyone to have a taste, we of course had to give them out for free. We were asking them to help us test out the labyrinth, so they could even take these items back with them as rewards.

Just in case, we also equipped the Dryads with the same items. If there was a problem, they could get back ASAP.

Given the sheer size of the labyrinth floors, it was unlikely for them to make it out of the first level. Even if they got to the stairs without getting lost, it was still over two kilometers' walk in terms of distance. Since we made the floor into a maze, it would take even more time to complete.

For the next three hours, it'd be best if they tried their hardest and entertained the audience. When the estimated time was reached, we would pull them back out using the items.

There were, of course, other forms of rewards.

For promotional purposes, we also prepared treasure chests with decent equipment as gifts for everyone. When the labyrinth officially opened, these chests would only be found on the second floor and below, but this time they were up for everyone to grab.

We wouldn't be mentioning these inside-dealings of course; Souka only explained what was necessary. Near the end, she began to explain the most important things.

"Well then, please have a look at this particular item. This is called a 'Resurrection Bracelet '. For anyone entering our nation's labyrinth, you must purchase this item. After all, this has an important ability---it can resurrect the dead!" s Souka explained, there was a wave of gasps from the crowd. *How is that possible*---and comments along those lines were uttered.

"Please rest assured! This is very important information, so please pay attention! This item only works inside the labyrinth of our nation! It's useless outside, so please remember that or you will end up pretty dead if misused. I do hope everyone can understand that it is ineffective outside!"

![break]

That was the most important point.

If someone accidentally tried to use it outside... That was not something that you could just get away with an, "Oops, that didn't work". Moreover, it'd be problematic if they pushed the responsibility onto us, even though it was totally the fault of the user himself.

With that being said... There were also certain kinds of people in this world called ~~Karens~~ difficult customers.

In order to get it through their thick skulls, we had to clarify this point. We had to be thorough when going through things, in case anyone mistook its use and thought that it could work outside of the labyrinth. We had to ensure that even an idiot knew that it wouldn't work outside to revive people. By that point, even if an accident did happen, it wouldn't be our problem.

I didn't want any of that unnecessary responsibility.

In my previous life, I found that people would always make the seller accountable for any issues, even if it was their own fault. In this way, to me, idiots who intentionally broke the rules and ended up dying was totally their own doing.

But either way, making sure everyone was well-informed was still our responsibility. We had to be extra cautious in that regard.

"---And that's all! I once again urge everyone to not use it outside at all!"

Souka's explanation was very clear for everyone to understand.

*There we go. Done.*

The only problem left was for someone to actually experience using it. Normally, people would hesitate when confronted with such a thing. However, with Ramiris's modification of the 'Resurrection Bracelet ', any pain and agony could be filtered out when a person was confirmed dead.

In addition, there was approximately a ten second gap between dying and being teleported back to the surface. We intentionally made it this way so people could use appropriate means to revive themselves.

With that being said, there were very few higher magic users that could perform the miracle spell 'Resurrection'.

By the way, even though a full healing potion was unable to revive the soul of a person, within the labyrinth, the soul would remain in the body. In other words, it was actually possible to resurrect people by repairing their body using the full healing potion.

However, I feared that this again might create some misunderstandings in the outside world---which was why we designed it so that if no proper means of resurrection was applied within ten seconds, the body would be teleported to the surface.

Just as Masayuki said, challenging the labyrinth was like playing a game.

With that, the explanation part was concluded.

Now we would have someone test out the 'Resurrection Bracelet ' right here.

"Then, does anyone want to try it out now---?"

I doubted anyone would, yet Souka asked away anyway. She was a lot bolder than I expected.

"Hmph, you won't die in the labyrinth? That's some real funny shit. I'm not gonna fall for your bullshit rhetoric!"

The bald, strong man---Basson---exclaimed as the others nodded in agreement, as if saying, "Sure, sure, much agreed".

Elen's party also didn't want to volunteer.

"Isn't that simple enough? Mister over there, how about you step up for the demonstration," Gai the 'Splendacious Sword Fighter' pointed at Myourmiles.

He didn't want to do it himself, and instead pointed at someone else to try---but fine, I suppose that was reasonable.

The way he spoke, however, was not as respectable.

"Me? Your proposal does make sense, so I shall accept."

Myourmiles, now appointed, seemed to have anticipated how things would develop. He didn't look particularly moved by it.

Especially since we actually had people experience it in real life already.

Shion's subordinate, Yomigaeri, had been subjected to that experience many times, so Myourmiles also believed that it was completely safe. There was no need to fear given the past experiments. Myourmiles calmly put on the bracelet and entered the labyrinth. At the same time, many challengers also entered with him.

"Then, I shall attack Mister Myourmiles here---" Souka said as she unsheathed her sword with one hand and prepared herself to attack Myourmiles. Yet Gai interrupted her by taking actions of his own.

"Don't think you can fool me now, HYA!"

As he finished, he went on to swing his sword and cut off Myourmiles's arm.

"---Wait!" Souka shouted to intervene, but it was too late.

"ARGH!" Myourmiles cried out as he held his wound.

Since pain was reduced in the labyrinth, he wouldn't die from shock, but it was nonetheless unpleasant to have your arm chopped off.

"HAHAHAHAHA! Look at yourself. Time to die!"

*That bastard dares to mock Myourmiles...*

I almost lost control, yet I saw a smirk on Myourmiles's face. I immediately calmed down at the scene. At the same time, Gai sliced his sword through Myourmiles's neck---Myourmiles's body suddenly turned into beams of light before disappearing. It was like nothing had happened. He reappeared at the surface, near the temporary entrance at the center of the stage. Even all of Myourmiles's clothes turned into light and he revived with his original appearance.

These scenes were all recorded by the Dryads using the crystal balls and passed onto the projector as the footage was shown on the large screen.

"Please have a look everyone, all my limbs are fine as before!"

Myourmiles was standing there casually, unharmed. His cut arm was restored to its original state, bringing us the best performance of the day.

"OHOOOO!"

The crowd gave off waves of loud cheers, some even shouting, "That was a miracle!" Our goal was reached most excellently. It would be troublesome if people suspected that it was some kind of a trick, yet Gai's overreaction proved to have convinced people even more so.

For people who still didn't believe at this point, we would just have to invite them to experience it for themselves. However, at the end of the day, these mechanisms were for the worst-case scenario. We would still prefer it if people acted cautiously. Being unable to die was all well and good, but it was best if they didn't have to experience it in the first place.

That's why we only needed to wait for adventurers who visited the labyrinth to leak such news. Some nut-job challengers would probably want to try it out themselves. But that wouldn't be a problem either.

The point was to encourage people to challenge the dungeon. Thanks to Myourmiles, our scheme came into fruition. As expected from Myourmiles, he had balls of steel. This was exactly the outcome I wanted, which was also why I tolerated Gai's actions.

It cost Myourmiles to endure such horrible things; I would have to go give him my thanks later, I thought to myself while watching the screen.

![hard scene break]

"Now then, you may start exploring the labyrinth! Once you step inside, you will find yourself in a world of unknowns. What will these brave adventurers encounter there---"

Souka began to broadcast the footage on stage. The large screen began to show the status of each group. As the broadcast proceeded smoothly, it also revealed the interior design of the labyrinth.

Souka's commentary was highly immersive. I was thinking: "She sure pays attention to details," as I also tracked each team's movement.

Let's look at Basson's team.

The labyrinth walls were designed to have uniform stonework.

Basson's party was moving on the first floor. I thought they would at least have someone sketch down maps, yet it seemed that none of them had the slightest intention of taking notes, nor were they putting markers on the walls. All they were doing was casually strolling down the aisles while shooting the breeze and laughing.

*Is this really okay?*

Cave exploration was a thing in this world, and stuff like taking contracts by people to exterminate monsters deep in the forests wasn't uncommon. In times like this, how did they manage to achieve their goals? Could it be that they had hired people to lead the way every single time...

"Tsk, why are we always walking down the same road! What the hell, these are all quadrilaterals!"

"Boss, didn't we just walk along this road as well?"

Before my worries could have been relayed to them, these people were already lost. We did mention that the area was extremely wide during the explanation, weren't they listening?

"Basson, this is bad! This labyrinth is larger than we imagined..."

*Ah, I get it.*

The first floor of the labyrinth alone was around 250 meters long on each side. We did mention that it was big, but these people seemed to have thought it would be smaller. It is likely that they didn't think the area was all that large when they heard that the labyrinth was a man-made facility underneath the colosseum.

I supposed that was fine, as long as they helped with the promotion, it would be okay. But we couldn't let them die on the first floor right out of the gates. If they ended up making it look like the labyrinth was so unfairly difficult, then no one would want to challenge it.

I hoped that they could at least progress to a certain extent. They could come back if killed anyway, the bracelet had the savior function. Using that mechanic, they could escape from the labyrinth, but they would be considered killed. Alpha and the other dryads would then go to assist.

This time they were even accompanying all of the contestants, so the dryads could forcefully teleport them back to the surface, if need be. That's why I hoped they would relax a bit and progress through the labyrinth carefully, and maybe even start taking it seriously from now on...

Being inundated by his companions' woes had made Basson look disgruntled.

"Are your heads full of shit? There's no way any labyrinth is that big. These are all tricks of the demon lord; he's trying to send us off the trail with magic."

"Y-yeah!"

"As expected from Basson-aniki!"

"Indeed, there's a dense layer of magicule here. As you have said, this is likely some hallucination or illusion magic at work."

"That's right, Gomez. From the start, we have always taken right turns at the intersections, in other words, we can easily turn around and go back the way we came."

No way, the problem was not the difficulty. Their plan sounded very comprehensive, but in reality, that wasn't the case. It'd be okay for them to have taken notes on paper or other items, however, since the hallways all had similar looking walls along them, they couldn't possibly remember every single one of them. There were also crossroads and T-intersections, as well as dead ends. There was complex terrain combined with almost identical scenery. Not even the first floor could be beaten by turning to the right every time.

The challengers were just too stupid. *Looks like I best not put too much hope into these people*...

But just as I thought so---

Basson's party vanished, or rather, they fell down to the next floor.

"A-are...! Did they just fall into a trap?" Souka asked, sharing my same confusion. *Was there a fall trap set on the first floor?*

"Ramiris---"

"U-umm, w-what?"

"---Nothing serious, it's just that I was the one who designed that floor. I don't recall little tricks like that, could it be you who made the change without my permission?"

My eyes narrowed as a smile hung on my face. This was to not scare Ramiris. Although, I had also locked my hands around her body in a vice grip to prevent her from escaping, before asking her the question.

"A-about that, it was because we wanted to further the completion of the labyrinth..." Ramiris answered with an ingratiating smile.

After some more persistent interrogation, she admitted to having set up an enormous amount of fall traps herself.

I angrily cursed as Ramiris, "You idiot!"

*Missy, do you know that we don't need fall traps on a wide-area floor?* The point of them is to get people lost in order to reduce their stamina. Having fall traps that gave them shortcuts would serve the opposite effect. A trap is only useful if its purpose aligns with the intended goal of a floor.

"B-but there are more vicious fall traps down in the lower floors. So I really was just wondering if you had forgotten to set one up in that area or something, my intention was all good."

She just *loved* poking her nose around other people's business.

*While it was bad to have set that trap up in the first place, the least you could've done was prepare a pit of needles at the bottom*. Ramiris, Veldora, Milim; I knew these three would mess up when laying the traps. That's why I personally designed the first floor...

I hurried to confirm the status of the other teams.

![break]

First was Elen's party.

Kabal was originally the leader, but right now Elen had taken control. These people all had a terrible sense of direction, my guess was that they would have difficulty in even getting through the first floor. But my guess was only half right.

Elen's party wasn't tricked by the fall traps, instead they were progressing very carefully. Surprisingly, they were neatly writing down relevant information about their progress on paper; it's the classic dungeon walkthrough strategy.

"Ho? Elen and the boys are so careful. They haven't stepped on any traps, even avoiding ones that I've set. They've also found their third treasure chest. They are progressing way too smoothly..."

"---Ehehe."

*What the heck? Something about this seems off.*

*Why are they doing so well?*

There was also one more thing that had caught my attention, Ramiris seemed to be trying to hide something with her smile right now.

"...Oi, Ramiris."

"W-what?!"

"I have a lot of faith in you, but could there be anything that you are hiding from me?"

"O-of course, Rimuru!"

"Then let me ask you this, did you do something with Elen's party?"

Judging by this screen alone, there was nothing out of the ordinary. However, their current record seems way too suspicious. Regarding the treasure chests set by me, most of them, naturally, were empty, yet they had found items inside them three times in a row. There was a good chance that they had been cheating.

"A-about that..."

*Again?*

"What did you do?"

"Ah, I did. Elen and her companions sent some gifts, so we were just chatting and having a good time! And then---"

...

It hurt my head just listening.

While Ramiris and the others were busy building the labyrinth, Elen sent a bunch of cakes to them. They were experimental products made by Yoshida-san, which must have been delicious. As Elen was sending the gifts, she became acquainted with the dryads, and through them, she managed to extract a bunch of information about the first floor.

Halfway through, Ramiris also found it odd, but the charm of the cakes was too irresistible for her...

"You can't blame me this time! It wasn't just me, even Mentor and Milim said it was fine!"

And she got desperate and began to argue how she was right. I was dumbfounded at this blatant act of bribery. I didn't expect her to become corrupted so quickly.

But with that being said, it wasn't as severe as I had imagined.

I did lower the difficulty of progression during the festival, and they only got information on one floor anyway. The really good treasure chests were not on that floor anyway.

"Kabal's team has been successfully acquiring treasure chests from the start."

"Indeed, according to His Majesty Rimuru, there will be treasure chests placed in various locations, such as small rooms. There are also traps mixed in with them, so you have to be careful."

"I see! Are there any precious items inside as well?"

"There will be on lower levels. Eh---speaking of it... The treasure chests are apparently categorized with three different variations. Those being bronze, silver and gold colors. I heard that only the bronze ones may be laden with traps."

The three different treasure chests contained different rewards, and there would only be bronze chests on the first floor. Inside these, you would, at most, find high-grade items, usually things such as a healing potion or silver coins. The rest would be failed creations from Kurobee's disciples, a.k.a. run-of-the-mill gear. If this was what adventurers wanted, we weren't losing much through that process.

"Surely, their goal would be the golden chests, right?"

"That's likely the case. However, golden chests will exclusively appear in boss rooms, which are found on every tenth floor."

"What does that mean?"

"Let me put it this way. I'm sure that everyone already knows Gozer-sama, who's the guardian of the 50th floor of the dungeon. By that deduction, there are similar rooms on the 40th, 30th, 20th and 10th floors, guarded by a "Floor Guardian". Only by defeating these strong foes, will you be able to open the golden chests. They are said to even have rare-grade gear inside them!" Myourmiles explained while reading off the note that I had given him.

Our goal this time was to advertise, so we had to utilize opportunities like this. Although, those words did sound highly suspicious, like some promotion on a late-night TV show. Even I, the writer of the note, felt a bit shameful hearing them, though those words were meant to stimulate people's desire.

It did have a tremendous effect however, "rare-grade gear" caused quite the disturbance at the venue.

"Everyone has witnessed Gozer-san's ability. That strong man is awaiting fellow challengers, to those who are confident in your abilities, you should try to challenge him!"

"There's one more thing. As everyone has seen, the floors are quite vast; I hope that people will be mentally prepared for a single walkthrough taking up several days," Myourmiles answered, providing answers to Souka's doubts. The two were a fantastic duo, as both the live broadcasters and commentators.

I confirmed once more that there were only bronze chests on the first floor.

"---Are you sure you haven't touched the contents of the treasure chests?"

"That, you can rest assured!"

*Okay then.*

After all, their method of progressing was almost a classic strategy, it would be great for promotion. Although I did mind the fact that Elen's party was playing tricks, I might as well just let them have those trinkets as a reward. It was definitely foul play to have obtained a map as well as the trap locations, but I'd close one eye for them this time. I already knew that Elen's party would be fine now.

![break]

Time to check on Masayuki, who I had leaked information to...

"OH OH---okay, now this is epic. They are already entering the fourth floor! The team known as "Shining" is as the name suggests. They're zipping through at the speed of light."

*PEW!*

How was that possible? They had only started the walkthrough less than thirty minutes ago, and they had somehow already gotten to the fourth floor! Masayuki's party must've intentionally stepped on fall traps and cheesed their way to the lower levels.

As for the audience's reaction---"MA-SA-YU-KI, MA-SA-YU-KIIII!"

*Could've guessed that from a mile away.*

The same audience that had mocked Basson's party for falling down the trap, instead gave Masayuki their approval and praise. This was a bit too ridiculous, but it *was* Masayuki's power.

I figured that Masayuki must've been terribly pissed at me right now, thinking that the information I gave him was bogus... *Sorry, that's not my fault.* But anything sounded like an excuse at this point.

After reaching the fourth floor, monsters began to patrol the roads. Relying on an incomplete map, that was missing a bunch of fall traps, must've been frightening. I still prayed to myself that he would do his best.

![break]

Let's check on the last guy---Gai.

This man was sprinting through the labyrinth, making good use of his physical prowess. Delta was flying around tirelessly trying to catch up with him. She was a semi-spiritual life form (half spirit, half living being), able to use 'Teleportation' via the vegetation. However, doing so would disrupt the live video feed she was supposed to relay. That must've been why she was trying so hard to keep pace with Gai by flying after him. Her dedication and enthusiasm towards her work was truly commendable. Despite Delta struggling, with the fear of falling behind, Gai couldn't have cared less, instead keeping up his steady pace while dashing through hallway after hallway. He kept on sprinting towards the stairs without ever getting lost, he appeared to be using magic or other means to gain knowledge of his surroundings.

<<Answer. It is the effect of Elemental Magic "Map Generation".>>

So, you could also do that when you didn't have a map at hand. It seemed to be the type of magic used by 'Great Sage' in the past. Magic like that could generate information about locations in his brain, that is, if he could cast the magic consistently. It seemed that not only was he skilled in the sword, he was also good with magic. He sure had some tricks up his sleeve.

I did inquire about him from Fuze, and it turned out that Gai was indeed the rare A Rank personnel. No wonder he had abilities like that.

He was currently tearing through the second floor and would be reaching the stairs soon. At this rate, it would take him another two hours before he reached the fifth floor. That was a lot faster than I expected, I never anticipated their progress to be so fast.

There's something else that was bothering me however---it was Gai's unusual expression. His mouth was twisted grotesquely, and his eyes were bloodshot...

By the time he reached the third floor, he hadn't shown any signs of slowing down either. But unlike the first and second floors, he wasn't even skipping a single small room---he was checking for treasure chests. Or perhaps it was the opposite case---he seemed to know where the treasure chests were at and was able to find the rooms with treasure chests effortlessly.

He was also only picking the silver chests.

"This guy... How's he doing that?" I muttered to myself. Raphael-sensei didn't respond. Looked like even sensei didn't know.

"I feel that this Gai guy has an especially strong desire. Is he perhaps the type that can even sniff out money?" Ramiris commented coldly, while I understood somewhat.

In any case, Gai was definitely not any ordinary person. What he did to Myourmiles was also unpleasant, so if possible, I hoped that we wouldn't be dealing with such a character any longer.

In this way, Gai's labyrinth strategy also made rapid headway.

![hard scene break]

Another two hours had passed.

Basson's party discovered another hidden room.

"Basson-aniki! There's another room here as well."

One of his companions discovered the door on accident.

"Could this be another trap?" Basson asked, his face filled with doubts.

Just now, they had been battling the trapped treasure chests filled with paralyzing toxin and sleeping gas. There was also a rather weak mimic they fought. They had developed PTSD from treasure chests.

"Oi, Ramiris. What's in the room of that treasure chest? If this continues, it won't have any good promotional effect, even I am starting to feel sorry for them, so it's about time for them to get something good..."

How should I put it, seeing how these people were getting tricked reminded me of the gacha game I played, and the sour memory of ten rolls of absolute garbage. After getting all that trash before, their misfortune weighed even on me. If they ended up losing their motivation, they wouldn't be coming back in the future... That's why I thought it was about time to give them some grand prize.

"D-don't worry. It was because those challengers sucked... Although it's not fair for me to say so, I really didn't expect them to be that reckless. B-but that room has one monster and a silver chest. I don't remember what was in it, but they will definitely get something good this time!"

*Fine, that should do it. I hope they will encounter at least something nice today---*

"AHH! It's a trap again, there's even a monster in here!"

"Tsk, how about we retreat for now?"

"We can't, Basson. It's already onto us!"

"It's a great-bear! It won't be easy for us to escape..."

The two sides were already staring at each other, observing what sort of move they would be making.

*---Eh, what is this?*

Only one monster appeared, there's no way you needed to panic like that. There was only a slim chance for a monster to already appear on the first floor, and there wouldn't be any strong ones on the second floor either. Yet this hidden room had a silver chest containing some quality reward. A strong monster was deployed to guard this chest... This hidden grand prize on the second floor.

Yet it only had a great-bear, a measly Rank C monster. Basson's team, with a combined strength of Ranked B, could easily take care of them. Despite this, Basson and Gomez were shocked upon seeing the great-bear.

"Basson-aniki, there's a treasure chest there!"

"It's silver."

"It may be trapped again, but all we can do now is fight. All right everyone, get ready!"

"Copy that!"

"Let's go, let's go!"

It seemed that Basson's six-man team finally made up their mind to fight. As they were staring at the great-bear, the team carefully raised their weapons.

"I'll be the bait; you guys take the chance and attack!"

Basson really had the composure of a leader, he'd decided to be a competent tank. He rushed into the room and shouted, diverting all of the great-bear's attention to him.

Basson and the great-bear confronted each other face-to-face.

"Oh! Basson's party appears to be engaging a monster in battle! Their opponent is a great-bear? I heard that one swing of its giant paw can easily take someone's life---"

I finally realized my mistake after hearing Souka's explanation.

*Right, this isn't actually a video game.*

Basson and his men were, after all, professional adventurers. They didn't want any of their men to be injured. Even the slightest misstep could have cost them their lives, and so they would most definitely avoid fighting monsters that yielded no profit. Even though they didn't really need to worry about dying in there, it would take some time for people to actually accept such a mindset.

*With that in mind, perhaps I should re-evaluate how I've been trying to promote the labyrinth...*

And soon, the battle began.

Basson lunged forward to take on the great-bear's attack. A look of desperation was etched on his face. The only thing between him and the monster was a worn-out piece of leather armor. A piece that didn't cover up his entire body and left his hands and lower sides completely exposed. He found himself in quite the precarious situation despite confronting an opponent weaker than himself. His great axe could land heavy chopping blows, yet it was not suitable to defend against a bear's claws. That's why Basson had been using his round shield to deflect the great-bear's paw.

His companions, on the other hand, were covering for Basson. To keep themselves safe, they were targeting the eyes and feet of the great-bear when launching attacks. The magician named Gomez, meanwhile, launched the great-magic spell Wind Slash to take its life.

"And it's at this moment that their battle to the death with the great-bear concludes! An excellent fight!"

"Indeed. Their actions were very logical and devoid of unnecessary complications. That was the style of experienced fighters."

As I listened to Souka and Myourmiles's broadcast, I mulled over the fight just now. Indeed, their teamwork was flawless. In the end, there were no casualties in Basson's team, and they took around five minutes to take down the great-bear.

But I couldn't shake off the troubles as new problems started to emerge.

"Oi oi oi, I didn't expect them to fight so cautiously against an enemy far weaker than themselves..."

"Um---I was surprised too. But shouldn't that normally be the case?"

"I suppose. Although not having drawn a map is indicative of poor performance, we seem to have underestimated their abilities."

"That's true, maybe it will take three days just to break through the first floor alone..."

"Um---if that's the case, we should really think about quantifying the rations..."

I didn't expect our project to be disrupted by something like this.

Basson's team had teammates of varying ranks, but their overall strength was the equivalent of Rank B. As for Basson and Gomez, with their good equipment, they may have been around Rank B in terms of skill. Yet we couldn't have anticipated that such a six-man team had to struggle in a fight on the second floor already.

In terms of results alone, it was their complete victory, though taking five minutes was perhaps way too long. However, as professional adventurers, they might also value safety more...

Maybe they should be taught to adapt different fighting strategies, perhaps they could adhere to the strategy of "Use healing potions even if it's only a scratch" to improve their combat efficiency.

Not sure why I was worried, but right now Basson's party was approaching the treasure chest.

"It looks like the room contained a treasure chest, it looks silver as well, what could possibly be inside...?"

Souka's words had tensed up the audience. While the other teams had opened treasure chests several times by now, people were still highly interested in the instant that they were opened.

One of Basson's teammates went up and immediately threw the lid open.

*Oi oi oi, shouldn't you at least check for traps?*

Silver chests weren't set with traps, but Basson's team had no clue of that. Just before this, they had gotten poisoned with paralysis and enveloped with sleeping gas. They also seemed to be taking turns when opening chests, but this wasn't a punishment game... Their crude way of opening the chest even put me, as a spectator, on edge.

In this regard, in the eyes of me, an epic gamer, I could only call them amateurs.

Having treasure chests inside labyrinths was a foreign concept to people here...is that why they were so quick to do something so reckless? From this point of view, Elen's party was at least somewhat better. Their team had Gido, who, so far, had ensured that they wouldn't trigger any traps while extracting items from treasure chests.

Basson's team's issue probably came down to them not having a thief. Professional adventurers that exterminated monsters were probably the buff type who weren't suited for situations like this. They should have hired teammates specializing in exploration.

*Hold up?*

It may be that the difficulty of the labyrinth was higher than we expected. I thought that the issue was Basson's party not being professional enough, but it would seem that a lot of people were simply not good at exploring a labyrinth. Their walkthrough couldn't be made faster.

I needed to reflect on the issue.

"OH, WOWOWO! Basson-aniki, it's a sword!"

*NICU!*

They seemed to have hit the jackpot. Moreover, the rare-grade jackpot deluxe. There were many different types of rewards, such as high-grade healing potions, ancient gold coins, or fine quality gear etc. We also designed it so that, starting from level two, there would be a very low chance of the reward being a rare-grade item.

What Basson got was a rare-grade sword.

"By the way, Mentor said that all of the treasure chests were designed to have higher reward drop rates!"

"I-is that so? But so far they have been getting shit rewards all around..."

It was rare for Veldora to be so generous, yet it was ruined by Basson's bad luck. No, had Veldora not raised the probability, they could have been getting shit gear even now.

With that being said, obtaining this rare-grade sword was a game-changer for them. This would be great for publicity. Basson's team would probably also want to test their luck even more. Upon thinking so, I had to compliment Veldora with a "Good job".

"For Veldora, this decision has been amazing. If you failed to leave these folks with some good memories, it would affect the future of the labyrinth exploration."

*I'll thank Veldora later.*

Basson's men whistled upon laying eyes on the sword.

They seemed to be very fond of the treasure.

"You guys, let's keep on going at this pace!"

Basson sheathed his great axe and changed his weapon to the sword.

In the next room, three Rank D bats appeared, all cut down by him in one smooth slash. The quality of the sword had perhaps added a bonus to their overall effectiveness, they seemed to have become faster in dealing with enemies.

This was a sword crafted by Kurobee's disciple. It barely made it to the level of rare-grade, however, to Basson's party, it was a mighty sword, nonetheless.

Gai was no exception in this regard. I heard that even the elite of Rank A had difficulty in gathering a full set of rare-grade gear. No wonder why Basson and his boys were so happy.

As if they were making up for their previous losses, the party pushed forward confidently. In addition, they also seemed to have obtained many "Magic Crystals" from the monsters.

"This sword is really nice, now we're making some profit. We may make more money than we expected."

"That's right, when this labyrinth is officially opened, we gotta come back for more!"

They chatted joyfully.

And so, Basson's party continued their walkthrough---

![break]

Let's have a look at Elen's team.

They were staying on the first floor, where it was difficult to find rare-grade gear. These folks were operating cautiously with safety in mind. One could say that they were overly cautious. But for that same reason, they were also able to pick all the treasure chests clean on the first floor, with the smoothest progression. Yet to their surprise, there was a turn of events.

"Have we farmed enough?"

"Are we really going there now?"

"Uh... Aren't you going to ask me about it...?"

"Of course we are going! We're gonna make it big this time!"

Kabal's opinion was completely ignored as Elen's party started making their way downstairs. With less than an hour left, they seemed to have set their minds on achieving their goal.

Their reason for staying on the first floor for that long was apparently to collect potions. They had also made full use of the information that Ramiris gave them, setting their target at the tenth level.

"Oh, Kabal's party seems to be on the move. Switching gears from the conservative strategy and deciding to go all the way down."

"Hmm---perhaps they've changed their strategy in order to find better treasure chests? However, relying on luck alone to find them won't be an easy task..."

"But just like Basson's team back there, won't silver chests also give you a rare-grade item?"

"That's not something you can get just by wishing for it. Look at Gai-san, he's opened more than twenty silver chests, yet his current rare-grade item count is still zero."

"Does that mean the only way to ensure you get a rare-grade drop is through a golden chest?"

"That's right. However, golden chests only appear in specific locations within the boss room, otherwise it will be..."

"There are other places?"

"Uh... There seem to be areas where you may stumble upon large regional monsters. It is said that a room guarded by this type of monster will also have a golden chest."

Upon hearing Souka and Myourmiles's conversation, I had an idea of what Elen intended to do.

"Oi, Ramiris."

"I'm here."

"Did you leak information about the spawn point of the region boss?"

"About that..."

"Did you or not?"

"Uhhh! It seems to have been a part of it!"

*Wow. Actually, I should think positively.*

An entertaining region boss would add to the promotional effect---I thought to myself. I recalled putting it near the fourth floor. Once it got beaten, it would change position, so right now it should still be there...

In this malignant monster room, you would have to deal with several Rank C-plus vampiric bats first. People entering without any knowledge would be swarmed by monsters, however, they could handle it if they were aware of the situation. However, there may be the red herring that tricked people into thinking that they had already figured out what awaited them inside. That would lead them into a world of hurt.

---While I was worried up until that point, it turned out that this was all for naught.

Elen's party intentionally used the trap to fall straight to the fifth floor. They pretended to be injured in order to shill the effect of the healing potion. Later, with the excuse of finding a resting place, they moved towards their actual destination.

*They've done everything perfectly, what fine actors.*

"Big bro, big sis, there's a room just around the corner, let's go rest when we get there."

"All right! By the way, are you all right, Kabal?"

"Um, uhhh. This healing potion sure is effective. Although I think I'm already fully recovered, let's go rest up before earning another pile of fat loot."

Kabal was the only one that gave a rigid delivery, yet the audience didn't notice. They were mesmerized by the events taking place on the screen. It was then that Gido opened the door of the room.

"WOH! There are vampiric bats here!"

"Don't worry. Kabal, we'll be counting on you!"

"...But I don't want to get my blood sucked."

Kabal's resistance was futile, the battle began.

He raised his scale shield and hid behind it, taking on the attack of the vampiric bats by himself. While the situation looked dire to the uninitiated, Kabal was unfazed. Since the vampiric bats couldn't really break through the toughness of the shield, he stopped the attack without breaking a sweat.

While Kabal was attracting the attention of the monsters, Elen prepared to cast magic.

"Here I come! Giant Magic Icicle Shotguuuun!"

A salvo of tiny shards of sharp ice rained down on the vampiric bats. The small room they were in made it impossible to escape the barrage. Elen's magic power was enhanced by her dryad staff. The vampiric bats were exterminated without a trace.

"Eh---this looked a bit too simple."

"Yeah, had this been Basson's team, it would be a battle of life and death..."

"We seem to be running at a deficit by giving them the golden chest that easily."

"But it's a bit of a stretch to view Elen's party as the norm."

*Indeed, Ramiris had a point.*

Upon second thought, it was only made this easy due to them cheating. Normally, there was no way things could have gone that smoothly. If anyone ended up finding the golden chest by running around in the labyrinth, we should definitely give them our congratulations and call them the lucky ones.

"That was a beautiful fight."

"Indeed, as expected from an experienced adventurer team. They have already held back much during the fight. Oh, Gido-san is opening the chest now."

"Oh oh! It's a golden chest, will it really have a rare-grade item?"

As I listened to the commentary, I turned my eyes to Gido's hands.

It was definitely going to be a rare-grade item, what would he get though?

"This is...a sword..."

"But I wanted defensive gear for magicians."

"Did you just say sword? Wonderful, I guess the old man above knows how hard I've been working!"

The three all had different expressions. Gido seemed rather perplexed, Elen looked upset, and Kabal's previous unmotivated expression had been ejected out of his system. Each of their reactions was interesting.

"Oh oh, there really was a weapon, Myourmiles-san!"

"Aha, that is for certain. The golden chests all have good stuff in them, that is the message Rimuru-sama wished me to relay to everyone."

I didn't remember requesting him to relay anything like that, though Myourmiles was pretty good at playing the crowds.

The item from the golden chest was a storm long sword.

Everyone seemed to think that it was a rare-grade item, yet it was in fact an authentic special-grade weapon. Just like the storm short saber I gifted Gido, it was a mighty sword crafted by Kurobee using a scale of Charybdis. It was likely due to the fact that Veldora had raised the probability of the reward rolls, that Elen had gotten the one-in-a-hundred chance to get the top-tier item.

With their goals accomplished, Elen's party immediately returned to the surface.

*Should I call these fellows too realistic...*

"We seemed to have given away too big of a prize this time, but never mind."

Due to the courageous act of Elen's party, I could only answer with a wry smile.

And so, Elen's party returned early, before the time limit.

![break]

On the flip side, let's check on Masayuki's squad and Gai.

The two parties were pretty much racing each other to the bottom floors. However, their difference was obvious.

Masayuki's party was moving at a terrifying speed. Two hours had passed, and they had already made it to the ninth floor.

"These guys were way too fast..."

"Sorry, I didn't expect something like fall traps to be used by people in that way..."

"But I don't actually think Masayuki and his men were exploiting them on purpose."

When I was talking to Ramiris, Masayuki was already taking down the ninth floor. With around fifteen minutes left on the clock, they were already on the tenth floor. As a result of taking a short cut with the fall trap, they had landed onto a perfect spot near the deepest room on the tenth floor.

It must have been this way due to Masayuki's good luck as well.

"Less than three hours and they managed to reach that place..."

In light of such incredible speed, I was utterly baffled.

Upon arriving on these floors, there will be monsters appearing on the roads. Sometimes they may even appear in packs, but Masayuki's companions were quite strong. They didn't face any significant obstacles and eliminated the monsters with one hit.

Apart from the fall traps, all the other information I gave matched up with reality. That's why Masayuki's party continued onward down the corridor while reading the map.

They finally reached the deepest room.

The stairs leading to the eleventh floor would only appear after defeating the Floor Boss in this hall. The floor guardian here was a great-spider with a difficulty level of Rank B.

Its majesty was truly fearsome---

"HEWH!"

As Jinrai swung his saber with tremendous force, the great-spider was sent to hell.

*W-what a pity. How can a single great-spider stand against Masayuki's party? If only there had not been any fall traps, they would at least have gotten stalled for a while on their way here...*

Masayuki's party managed to open the golden chest and got hold of a rare-grade short sword. They also shrewdly located the save point.

Upon seeing this, I decided to remove all fall traps. After defeating the Floor Boss, Masayuki's party wasted no time in using 'Return Whistle' to return to the surface. They were the second team to reemerge on the surface.

When Masayuki's party vanished from the hall, the once shut door was opened again.

"Masayuki-san and his teammates have returned. This time it will be Gai-san who's gonna challenge the Floor Boss."

"Gai-san has managed to progress so far by himself. He didn't step on any trap or fall into any pits and made it through the passages with incredible speed."

"His speed was so fast, that by the time the trap had triggered, he was already far and away. That is a rather surprising strategy, not one that any average person could adapt."

Hearing Myourmiles's words, some adventurers in the audience nodded in agreement. That's how fast you'd get through solo farming, however, it probably wouldn't be the same with a team.

Gai at least didn't dishonor his place as an elite adventurer. There was no way he'd fall into a challenging battle in the lower floors. For unknown reasons, he even farmed a bunch of silver chests. This guy's gotta be the worst beta tester in history.

But those were just my thoughts, I couldn't really do anything about him under these circumstances.

"Tsk, did that shitty chosen hero get ahead of me? Never mind, revive the Floor Boss at once!" Gai commanded arrogantly.

*While I may be angry, I am a mature adult after all, so I'm bearing it.*

"By the way, Myourmiles-san. What will happen when an event like this plays out?"

"Umm, the Floor Boss seems to take around thirty minutes to be revived."

"That must also include the golden chest, right?"

"That's what I heard. Other than that, there may be situations where adventurers come into conflict over the chance to fight against the boss. Rimuru-sama seemed to have had worries about that."

"I see. Then Gai-san won't have enough time."

"Most likely. There is not much time left, surely this will mark the end of his attempt."

There were fifteen minutes left on the three-hour time limit. Hearing that there wasn't enough time, Gai himself began to complain obnoxiously.

"Quit joking around! Are you giving me an order? I know you're incompetent, so there's no need for me to cooperate with you. Revive the Floor Boss at once!"

Gai's bloodshot eyes were burning with desire as he talked to himself. Delta was listening to him rather indifferently, mostly ignoring his words, that is, until Gai's next line of rants caused her to twist her expression.

"Hmph! Incompetent ruler is incompetent after all. These are rules set by you losers. I don't have to follow jackshit!"

*Ah, he finally said it.*

He shamelessly said, in front of the labyrinth manager no less, that he was gonna ignore the rules. No matter how much Gai shouted, the rules wouldn't change. But whether the labyrinth manager would let him off the hook for that one, well, there was only one answer to that.

"Your speech has clearly violated the rules set by our nation. We won't pursue further responsibility if you are willing to apologize. But if you continue to utter such hateful words, I will not sit by without action."

"What did you say? How dare a mere receptionist be so pompous, don't be ridiculous!"

Delta had calmly given him the warning. Gai, on the other hand, took her for a fool and laughed her words off.

"There has been a clear violation of the rules. Proceed to execution."

"Hmph, did you just say execution? What the fuck do you think you can do to me---"

The next instant, vines emerged from the ground and ensnared Gai's body.

"---What!"

"The pain resistance of the 'Resurrection Bracelet ' has been deactivated, will you apologize now?"

Small spikes emerged from the vines binding Gai's body and had found their way through the gaps in his armor to pierce his flesh. He appeared to be in unbearable agony. Delta had cast Spirit Magic "Vine Bondage" without Gai's notice.

"D-damnit! Do you think you can defeat me with this?"

"This is the last warning. Will you apologize now?"

"Don't underestimate me! That kind of lame magic can only---"

Gai suddenly lost his voice midway. That's because Delta had severed Gai's head from his body with her slim finger.

Gai really had picked the wrong opponent when choosing to fight against Delta. He was indeed of Rank A ability, but Delta was a dryad. Although she didn't have combat experience, by her racial instinct alone, she had already exceeded Hazard-class. With more experience accumulated in the future, surely, she would become Calamity-class like Treyni and the other dryads. There was no way someone like Gai could win.

The audience couldn't help but feel shaken to see that Gai, the active participant during the tournament, was taken down by the nice lady Delta. They deeply believed that Gai was a strong man, yet he was killed instantly, without being given the chance to even resist. There was no way they wouldn't feel surprised to witness such a scene with their own eyes.

Reading the current mood, Myourmiles began to comment calmly.

"By the way, the words of the labyrinth manager are equivalent to the rules of the labyrinth. If you disregard the rules like just now, you will be adjudicated."

According to Myourmiles, as long as you followed the rules, you'd be just fine.

"H-how terrifying. Then what will happen to Gai-san?"

"Not anything severe. They will only confiscate the items he obtained in the labyrinth. But the pain resistance function of the 'Resurrection Bracelet ' was also deactivated, surely he would have felt immense pain."

While there was a punishment for violators, it wasn't much in reality. The only punishment being, that all of the achievements by the person in question would be forfeited, nothing else. If the person in question behaved too poorly, we may ban him from entering the labyrinth... But that would have to be done after some investigation.

"Ah! Gai-san is outside. But unlike Myourmiles-san just now, he seems to have passed out."

Gai's body turned into beams of light as his head was chopped off, but a new one regenerated on the ground. However, he had been in a coma since. After all, the punishment this time had a lot more punch to it. Delta utilized her special authority to restrict the function of the "Resurrection Bracelet ". It's certain that Gai would be fine even after being punished, but it would probably take some time for him to recover from the shock of dying.

Considering the way he had treated Myourmiles, as well his arrogant attitude towards Delta, Gai really was an annoying man. That's why I felt avenged by what had transpired.

Gai would more or less reflect on himself now.

"As long as you follow the rules, the safety mechanism of the 'Resurrection Bracelet ' will be intact. But Gai-san decided to ignore the rule. In this establishment, adventurers are barred from in-fights. You will also have to listen to the advice of the labyrinth managers. There are many detailed regulations. We will be releasing a pamphlet regarding the must-know after our official opening. The receptionist will explain it to those who are illiterate. In order to prevent anyone from getting Gai-san's treatment, I hope all will abide by the regulations."

"And with the outcome like this, it is quite a shame for Gai-san. But after the official opening, if you wait for a while, the floor boss will be revived! Fights among adventurers are also forbidden. Please adhere to the rules and explore the labyrinth properly!" Souka announced loudly.

*What do you mean by exploring the labyrinth properly? She didn't answer this question.*

The atmosphere amidst the audience had become a bit awkward, but Souka managed to swing the mood back around.

During that period, Gai also regained consciousness, and upon recalling what had happened to him, he was both shocked and regretful.

Seeing Gai recovering, the audience gradually regained composure.

*This is great, this is great.*

It looked like the audience had realized that Myourmiles's comments were accurate as well. While Gai was indeed annoying, observing him did yield us some useful information.

As long as we re-examined our strategy and employed countermeasures to prevent high-grade adventurers from only coming in to loot treasure chests, we wouldn't suffer too much loss. On the other hand, this moment served to educate people on what would happen if you didn't adhere to the rules.

And so, I was personally rather satisfied by the outcome of Gai's run.

![hard scene break]

The current situation was that most teams had finished exploring the labyrinth, with Basson's party still remaining. There were around ten minutes left on the clock before the scheduled deadline. It was about time to have Basson's party end this round.

As I thought about it, I heard a scream, "YAAAA!" as one of Basson's companions fell. He was probably ambushed by the monsters in the room, resulting in his right eye getting pierced by an arrow.

That's why I said that opening a door without a care in the world was dangerous.

There was a skeleton archer sniping anyone who wished to enter the room. The second person to fall was shot right between the eyes, and, unlike Gai, his body only vanished after ten seconds. The labyrinth event was about to end, he picked the right time to die so as to experience death in the labyrinth.

The skeleton soldiers were taken down by the remaining four.

"W-what! There had been no casualties until now, yet two had just been killed. But rest assured everyone, the people who just died would soon be safely resurrected on the surface!" Souka gave her live commentary on the state of Basson's squad. Myourmiles also helped to fill her in.

Basson's party had a highly immersive fighting style, the audience couldn't peel their eyes off them. Or more precisely, the rather engaging fight, visible on the big screen, had made them immerse themselves in the scene as well. Every time a monster showed up, it was met with screams and yelps from the audience. Such reactions were quite interesting.

Perhaps it was like watching a horror movie. When someone died, there were even people lamenting, as if they were at the scene.

It may be just as interesting of an event to broadcast the exploration of the labyrinth itself. Although playing any footage would probably cause some issues, we should perhaps try to negotiate with adventurers challenging the labyrinth regarding the rights to play their footage.

And just like that, I came up with this small idea.

By the time I snapped out of my thoughts, the time was almost over. The experience itself was sufficient enough. With Basson's party, the atmosphere was unnecessarily nerve-racking. In terms of the outcome, they were very wonderful adventurers.

At the start they were still pompous enough to mock Masayuki, saying that they would unveil the truth about the labyrinth, and that its vast landscape was but some trickery. Compared to their arrogant words from before, they seemed to have completely forgotten those things and lost themselves in the exploration of the labyrinth.

These people were shedding their manly tears and calling the names of their fallen comrades. Not only did they wallow in delusional ideas, they also liked to ignore other people's advice. But that did seem to be how a lot of adventurers behaved. Perhaps it would prove highly valuable to use these people as a case study.

"Well then, everyone, it's about time to get back."

Alpha, who was in charge of Basson's party, announced, clearly not reading the air.

Basson was frustrated by Alpha's attitude, yet she ignored him and forcefully activated everyone's "Return Whistle".

"Son of a---!" the curse words slipped out of Basson's mouth.

But as soon as they got back to the surface, he immediately ate his words.

"Ah, Basson-aniki, I really do seem to have been revived."

His fury fizzled out as his confused companions came to welcome them.

"This is rad! Did you really get revived?"

"Yeah, I thought I was done for as well. But it didn't hurt as I imagined; the revival was very successful."

"What are you on about, there's no way that's true. There're not many people who know revival magic, it's all because of this bracelet!"

Basson's party shared their joy as they chatted to confirm whether their revived companions were safe or not.

"Shit, my right eye---"

"Why don't you try this?"

The man whose right eye was shot by an arrow, was fully healed through the potion.

"This is really awesome. For guys like us, who rely on the strength our body delivers, this is the perfect environment."

"Is that so? We gotta try harder next time!"

*No no no, you were trying too hard from the get-go. The danger of potential traps didn't even cross your minds, so I can't imagine how you could possibly make it to the lower levels filled with them.*

I managed to hold back all the things I want to point out about them.

The audience's reaction was the important part. They had taken in the entirety of Basson's party's walkthrough and also got to learn just how safe the dungeon was.

The promotional event was arguably a huge success.

The challengers stood together on the stage. I also walked on stage and stood before them. This would be my final address towards this public demonstration of the dungeon.

"I'm not sure how everyone else felt, did you all have fun? This dungeon is planned to be open in the near future. It's guaranteed to be safe, and we welcome those who are interested to challenge it. For those who made it to the 100th level underground, you will have the right to challenge me!"

The microphone in hand, I ended the event with this line.

*That was pretty good.* The final match just now also excited everyone, the viewing of the interior of the labyrinth also gave the audience an immersive experience.

And with that, the public demonstration of the dungeon concluded peacefully.

![break]

---If it had ended there, it would've been perfect.

"Rimuru, what's the situation? How long do I have to wait until the challengers arrive?"

*He has obviously not listened to any of my words*, this Idiotic King of the Labyrinth Veldora had contacted me through 'Telepathy Net'.

My good mood was completely ruined.

"So noisy, how many times do I need to tell you! Listen, there won't be any challenger going to the bottom floor this time!"

"W-what? That's not what you said before!"

"THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID, YOU BIG DOOFUS! You have to listen to my words carefully!"

We went on arguing for a while. This was a new low for this misbehaving brat to hit during this festival, though It was practically normal at this point. He just got too excited and messed things up. That was why, this time, I was going to criticize Veldora non-stop until he reflected on himself.
