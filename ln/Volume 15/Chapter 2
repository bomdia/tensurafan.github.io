# Chapter 2: Unleashed|Power

It was probably the first time that anger had blown away my reason. When Shion and the others were killed, I had felt a mixture of regret and anger, and was engulfed in guilt. But since there was hope in sight, I had been able to calm the storm in my heart, keep my cool and take my anger out in productive ways...

But this time was different. The pain of having my soul torn apart and the possibility of losing Veldora had completely blown away my sense of reason.

The odds of success? Who cares? Crush the enemy. That is all.

"Rimuru-sama, what should we do? It seems we've been isolated in a special space, but can we pry it open by force?"

I didn't need Benimaru to tell me this, but I sensed that we were trapped.

Since the enemy's goal was to capture Veldora, it was only natural that they would take steps to prevent us from interfering. We were the ones who were too stupid to realize that and fell into the trap.

![break]

<<...Apologies. I'm really sorry.>>

![break]

Strangely enough, even the 'Wisdom King Raphael' was confused. Perhaps it couldn't believe that it had been played by others and had become less calm than usual. Although it was just a Skill, it was so human-like that it could make me smile---but I didn't have the luxury to think about that right now.

Right now, my emotions were only one color of anger.

I thought to myself, 'Enough with the apologies, let's find a way to get out of here.' Then it replied that there was a good grasp of the coordinates and that 'Analyze and Assess' of this space would soon be completed.

The 'Wisdom King Raphael' was truly capable, after all.

"No problem. We're getting out now, but I'm aiming for the enemy leader. Listen up, Veldora has fallen into Rudra's hands. As soon as we arrive with 'Spatial Transportation', we're going to have a battle on our hands, so you'd better prepare yourselves," I told them, swallowing my anger.

I didn't want to take things out on my friends. All of this anger should be directed at the enemy.

They nodded, and I added one more order.

"Now that the mana provided by Veldora is gone, Ramiris will not be able to take much anymore. The cities that have been evacuated into the labyrinth will be thrown out onto the surface, so please focus on their defense."

It was only a matter of time now.

The current burden on Ramiris was unimaginable, so we had to go quickly.

"Understood, but what about Rimuru-sama?"

"I'm taking Veldora back!"

That took precedence over anything else. So I told them I'd let them handle the rest, and everyone understood without saying a word.

"H-hold on a minute! Aren't you guys forgetting the most important thing?! How are we going to get out of here?"

Just when I thought he'd gone quiet, Laplace suddenly started complaining. That kind of thing was easy.

"Just break through it."

"That's absurd! This is the rumored 'Fortress of Dreams'. It's in another dimension and there's no easy way out. They say it's a place meant for isolating troublesome opponents. That's---"

He sure knew a thing or two, but I had other plans for now.

![break]

<<Notice. Preparations are complete.>>

![break]

All right!

"Well then, let's go. Laplace, I'll get you out of here too, after that, it's all you."

"Yes?! That's why I'm saying to listen---"

Laplace was about to say something, but none of that mattered to me right now.

I would quickly rescue Veldora and eliminate the enemy.

In a state of rage, I activated 'Spatial Transportation'.


![soft scene break]


We arrived at the exact location as planned. This kind of transportation without hesitation was sort of an unthinkable act for me. But I didn't care about that right now.

I could see two True Dragons in front of me, and an airship flying behind them. The enemy was directly ahead. All that was left was to go on a rampage. And yet, 'Wisdom King Raphael' was annoyingly warning me of the danger.

I'm sure it's because it was aware of the enemy's strength, but to me, it was just a distraction. Once I've decided to do something, of course I have to do it to the very end, so there's no point in panicking now.

*Do something!*

I silenced it with an order.

![break]

<<Understood. Optimal action 'Demon Summoning' is recommended.>>

![break]

Hmm, that sounds pretty good. If we didn't have enough combat forces, then just increase them. And on that note, let's finish up the evolution of Testarossa and the others that had been postponed until now.

I will give it my all here. And then, crush the enemies once and for all.

Velgrynd's eyes widened slightly in surprise as she noticed us.

Was it the 'Fortress of Dreams' thing? She really seemed to believe that she had blocked our movements with that, but something like that wasn't even a problem with the 'Wisdom King Raphael's' calculations.

I was connected to my companions by a Soul Corridor. If I traced back the connections, it was no problem figuring out my positional coordinates. Even if I was in another dimension, 'Spatial Transportation' was possible.

Benimaru and the others were on alert to protect me and the capital Rimuru that had appeared far behind us. So, rest assured, I would do what I had to do.

<Testarossa, Ultima, Carrera! Can you move?>

<Rimuru-sama! Of course!!>

<It's fine, there's no problem!>

<It's impossible to answer no to a question from Milord.>

Three different answers came back, and they didn't sound like they were hurt.

I was relieved. In that case, I would make a move to free Veldora without hesitation. I used the suggestion from Wisdom King Raphael and would perform Demon Summoning.

However, someone got in the way. Perhaps judging it to be dangerous, Kondou was the first to move. Normally, bullets would not have been able to reach, but he had fired without regard to the distance.

The bullet reached several dozen times the speed of sound. My thoughts accelerated a million times faster than usual grasping the details of that attack.

*Defend me*, I thought to myself and Wisdom King Raphael responded with an 'Understood.' Without any problems, the 'Absolute Defense' of the 'Covenant King Uriel' succeeded in nullifying the attack. This attack was nowhere close to the one used on Veldora.

![break]

<<Notice. Barrier destruction effect detected... Successfully disabled. Continuing, detected an attack that destroys the mind and magic circuits... Disabled. As a result of 'Analyze and Assess', the attack has been determined to be caused by the Ultimate Skill 'Conviction King Sandalphon'. From now on, relevant countermeasures will be begin--->>

![break]

I ignored the analysis of 'Wisdom King Raphael'.

I glanced at Kondou, Damrada and the others, and decided that they could be dealt with later. The attack they used on Veldora was really threatening, but there must be a reason why they hadn't used it again. Either they didn't use it, or they couldn't use it.

That attack, which was close to the speed of light, would be impossible to avoid if it got close. But from a long distance, as long as I was not careless, I'd be able to deal with it in time.

Despite this situation, Kondou had not moved from his spot. He was probably protecting Rudra, but I figured it was safe to ignore him.

![break]

I uttered the words.

"Come forth, demons! Greater Demon Summoning Gate Creation!"

A huge magic circle appeared in the sky. What emerged was a great gate exuding an ominous aura. It transcended time and space, summoning the demons that were connected to me. The first ones to respond to my call were the three demonesses. Then the two demon peers and the four archdemons appeared, followed by the six hundred demons who were their subordinates. The majority of the Black Numbers had gathered.

"Kufufufufu. Rimuru-sama, I have sent my subordinates to defend the city."

That's Diablo for you. He knew exactly what I wanted without me saying a word.

Aside from Venom who was Masayuki's escort, we had all the subordinate demons free at our disposal.

Benimaru had also regained the command he had left with Moss and was issuing orders to the entire army. Even though I hadn't said anything, the support system was perfectly in place. That being the case, it was time to finish the ritual quickly before any more obstacles could get in the way.

As soon as they landed on the ground, the demons knelt down before me.

The three demonesses were in the front, but they were sullen, perhaps thinking that they had failed to obey my orders.

" " "My deepest apologies!" " "

They apologized as soon as they saw my face.

"No, there is nothing to apologize for. The goal of stalling Velgrynd was accomplished as planned. This time, I am the one responsible for not seeing through her 'Parallel Existence' trick."

This kind of thing was unpredictable if it wasn't known about in advance. One can't plan anything if they're afraid of any and all dreamlike powers that might exist. This time there was really nothing we could have done. Besides, the way Testarossa and the others had fought was quite helpful information and definitely not meaningless.

As much as I wanted to express my gratitude to them, that would have to wait for later.

I gave strict orders to the demons.

"Listen well, I will now grant you power. However, you are not allowed to fall asleep. Like Diablo, all of you must endure your evolution on the spot!"

I thought I was saying something crazy. I had never said anything I couldn't do myself before. I, myself, had fallen into an evolutionary slumber when becoming a demon lord due to the Harvest Festival's effect, and now I was ordering the demons under my control to endure it. I didn't think that was right, but now was not the time to think about that.

Those who couldn't keep up would be left behind.

Perhaps reading my intentions, the three demon girls smiled fearlessly and waited for me to continue.

"Can you do it?"

"Certainly."

"Of course!"

"As Milord wishes!"

All three of them had a look of confidence on their faces.

I gave them the 'Souls' without hesitation. I didn't think about what would happen if it failed. If Testarossa and the others went out of control, I could just use that as a diversion.

My priorities would not waver.

That is why I offered these words to the demons who had begun to evolve.

"You can go as wild as you want. You can spread as much death and destruction as you like. However, you must not die. *Those guys* must not get in the way. Until I release Veldora, you will use your bodies as shields to hold the enemy back!"

While telling them not to die, I ordered them to lay down their lives.

It was so selfish, but that's who I was.

"What should we do about Veldora-sama's sister?" Diablo asked me, but the answer to that question was already settled.

"No problem. If she interferes, I will handle her. I'll just *devour* her."

Hearing this, Diablo smiled happily.

Not just Diablo, but the others as well. Benimaru smiled fearlessly. While Souei had a sneer on his face. Shion was beginning her warm-ups with a huge smile on her face.

They were all reliable friends.

![full page image](image3)

"We shall clear the way for you."

I nodded to Benimaru's words.

"Mm. Then go. Go and kill them all!"

" " "As you wish." " "

This was good.

![break]

Now I could focus on Veldora without any worry. And so, I turned my gaze to Veldora. Apparently, while I was getting ready, Velgrynd was preparing to intercept. She seemed to have received magicules from Veldora and seemed to have fully recovered.

That power of recovery was the true essence of Veldora. It was because of Veldora's enormous amount of magicules that recovery in such a short time was possible.

But now, Veldora was hostile to me. Without a doubt, he had become Emperor Rudra's puppet. Velgrynd also seemed determined, and it looked like I would have to deal with two True Dragons.

It was going to be tough, but I would just have to do it.

As I told Diablo, if Velgrynd was going to be my enemy, I would have to eliminate her.

"Wait for me, Veldora. I'll release you soon."

I muttered to myself and spread my wings to fly.


![hard scene break]


After Rimuru had flown away, those who remained sprang into action.

Benimaru grasped the situation on the battlefield and started giving out the appropriate commands. At the same time, he sent out a 'Telepathy Net' to the remaining executives in the city, quickly shifting them to an emergency position.

Souei dispatched his 'Clones' to various locations to gather information.

Meanwhile, Diablo was at the peak of his excitement.

"Kufufufufu! Did you see that, everyone? Rimuru-sama is finally going to show his serious side!"

Shion replied to Diablo in astonishment, "Fool! No matter what he does Rimuru-sama is always wonderful. We must save our excitement for later and now focus on crushing the enemy!"

Even though there was something strange with that statement, Shion's words were correct. It was understandable for them to be surprised as this was the first time they would witness Rimuru going on a rampage, but now was not the time to ponder on it. As Benimaru had declared, the role of the executives was to clear the way.

Moreover, it was an edict from Rimuru. This was gospel for the executives.

For the demons summoned by Rimuru, this was even more of a supreme pleasure. Their faces were full of joy, and they were filled with energy because now was their time to be of service. It was obvious from their demeanor, how long they had been waiting for this call. As if to prove the depth of Rimuru's anger, their terrible power of destruction was about to be unleashed.

The order given was very simple.

![break]

Kill all the enemies!

![break]

In response to that order, the demons' hearts were set ablaze by their mission.

<As our lord wishes!!>

The demons, who had nothing to fear, were prepared to throw themselves into battle to serve their lord.

However:

"Stop!"

Diablo's single word stopped them all in their tracks. All the demons simultaneously turned their attention to Diablo. He held up one hand to ease the demons back.

"Kufufufufu. Do you all understand? It is Rimuru-sama's command that not a single one of you must die. That is to say, a single one of your deaths would be so unforgivable of a sin that it could not be repaid even if the executives gave their heads."

The demons fell silent as Diablo spoke cheerfully.

Diablo's smile instilled more fear in them rather than any sense of confidence. Besides, what Diablo had said was true, with no room for rebuttal. The demons quietly waited for the next words.

It was Benimaru who opened his mouth.

"Diablo is right. You may think you are immortal, but that kind of sophistry won't be accepted, it is nothing but an excuse in front of Rimuru-sama!"

The fact that they could be resurrected over time was not a good enough reason to die. Benimaru's words corrected the demons' misunderstanding. They all realized their mistake and became quiet.

On seeing this, Diablo opened his mouth.

"Therefore, it is necessary to decide the division of roles beforehand. Benimaru-dono, could you please make the assignments?"

"What are you going to do?"

Benimaru asked, wondering if Diablo would listen to his instructions.

"Oh, please leave me out of it. There is a rat that I'm curious about, so I'm going to deal with it."

Upon hearing this answer, Benimaru shrugged. He had expected it from the start.

"...I see. Well, you do whatever you want."

*It's better not to have anything to do with Diablo*. That was what Benimaru was thinking.

In the first place, Diablo was under the direct control of Rimuru, so even Benimaru had no authority to give him orders. It was just that, this time, Diablo himself had entrusted Benimaru with the task, so Benimaru had acted accordingly.

"Then, Diablo is free to act as he pleases. Moss, as you have been doing till now, continue sending me information from the battlefield. Spread out throughout the battlefield only in accordance with Rimuru-sama's wishes."

Diablo nodded with a smug smile on his face.

Moss nodded his head in agreement. Since he had already scattered his clones, he and Benimaru were still connected to the 'Telepathy Net' in real time.

"I won't forgive you if you leave me out of this."

Shion spoke in a dignified manner.

Shion could also perform 'Spatial Transportation', but only within her field of vision since she was not good at calculating coordinates.

Benimaru chuckled and nodded his head.

"Of course, I'm counting on your strength as well. There are eight major entities on that airship, not including Emperor Rudra. They will be a bit difficult to deal with but it's not as unreasonable as Rimuru-sama's chosen opponents. Even without Diablo, we should be able to manage on our own."

"The battlefield is also troublesome. As many as 30,000 enemy reinforcements are coming in one after the other," Souei advised.

Of course, Benimaru was already aware of that.

"I know. That's why it's a race against time. I've ordered Gabil to stall for time as long as he can, so we have to take the emperor into custody before there are any casualties."

Benimaru spoke fearlessly, and Souei and Shion nodded in agreement.

As long as Rimuru wished for it, Benimaru had no choice. He would do everything in his power to make those desires come to fruition, so he drew up what he believed was the best strategy. The plan was to stallor time and take out the most troublesome opponents of the airships. The decision was made on the premise that doing so would, conversely, prevent an attack on their city.

Incidentally, the eight entities that Benimaru was referring to were the 'Split Body' that Velgrynd left behind as insurance and the 'Single Digit' members that had gathered together. The latter included Lieutenant Kondou, Damrada, the four knights guarding the emperor, and the last one was Marco. Now that no one was hiding their presence, Benimaru was able to detect them with his Unique Skill 'Generalissimo'.

At this time, Benimaru received good news.

"---Geld has responded. It seems that he has just completed his evolution and woken up."

The "Barrier Lord" Geld had awakened. In response, his men were also beginning to wake up. He said that they would soon be joining the city defense.

"That's a great addition. If Geld-dono is willing to defend the city, we can remove the devil chevaliers from defense duty."

"Will those guys be under my command as well?"

"We cannot displace Venom together with them, hence they won't be able to move in a systematic manner. It would be better to let each of them make his own decision based on the circumstances of the battle."

"Got it."

Thus, with a short exchange between the executives, the roles were decided. All that remained was to believe in victory and take action, but there was still one more thing left to be confirmed.

"So, are you guys still able to fight?" Benimaru asked Testarossa and the others.

There was no hesitation in his words. It was only a question to confirm whether they could be counted on as a fighting force or not.

"Kufufufufu. There's no need to ask. Needless to say, anyone under my command who answers 'No' is not needed here."

Diablo turned his gaze to Testarossa and the others.

Not needing to be pressured, Testarossa and the others stood up.

"That's a silly question. There's nothing Diablo can do that I cannot."

"It's a bit tough, but I don't have a problem with it either. I like to fight!"

"I can't afford to make another mistake if I want to live up to His Lordship's expectations. Now is not the time to sit here and rest."

To be of service to Rimuru-sama---the girls were united in their wills. And so were their subordinates. The demons were rapidly completing their evolution.

They now received the long-awaited order with the greatest of joy.

.........

......

...

At this point, Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera had evolved into 'devil lords' like Diablo had. They had become divine demons, one of the strongest beings in the world, capable of defeating even a demon peer without an issue.

In this way, all of the Seven Primordials had become equal in rank, with all restrictions lifted.

![break]

Just as Diablo's servant Venom had become a demon peer, Testarossa's servants also received a *gift* in the form of evolution. Although Moss and Veyron remained demon peers, their magicule counts had increased to the point where it was comparable to that of an awakened demon lord.

The other four, Agera, Esprit, Zonda, and Cien, had also become demon peers, surpassing even the Demon Lord Seed. They had evolved into the highest-ranking of demons in both name and substance. These demons were of the same rank, however, there was a clear difference in ability. The differences in their titles directly defined their class.

Moss had become an archduke, comparable to a king. Veyron became a duke, Agera was a marquis, Esprit was a count, Cien and Zonda were viscounts. As a side note, Venom was recognized as a baron.

Among the rest of the demons, several archdemon commanders were born. This was the equivalent to knighthood, where they would then work for many more years to officially be knighted. The remaining almost six hundred demons had become devil chevaliers, rivaling the greater majins.

All to become stronger and more useful to Rimuru. The demons had evolved.

.........

......

...

Without a single one left out, the demons showed their willingness to join the battle.

Benimaru nodded in satisfaction.

"All right. I look forward to your performance."

And just like that, the three demonesses and their confidants quickly joined the airship assault, but Benimaru had given the order without hesitation, as if he had intended to do so from the beginning.

"Well then, Testarossa-dono. I'd like to ask you to clean up the trash. Can you do that?" he asked.

"Yes, of course. That will be easy," she replied.

"Wait a minute," Ultima cut in, "I want to do it! I can do it too, you know?"

In response, Benimaru spoke without getting offended.

"It doesn't matter who does it, but I want to keep that airship. We must use it as a battlefield to settle the score with Emperor Rudra."

"Kufufufufu. Ultima, I asked Benimaru-dono to assign the duties. If you disagree with this, it means you are going against me. Think about that before you speak."

Ultima was fortunate that Diablo was in the best of moods.

Normally, what she said would have earned her a punishment from Diablo but it only ended in getting her admonished, since he was in a very good mood.

"Tsk, that's too bad. You're right, this job is not for me. I will follow Benimaru-san's instructions."

Ultima had realized immediately that she was in trouble. So she was relieved that the conversation had gone smoothly without a hitch, settling the matter, pretending to agree as if no longer stubborn.

Ultima was so innocent that she sometimes made mistakes, but she was surprisingly good at reading the air.

"Then I'll continue," said Benimaru, and assigned roles to the remaining members.

First, Testarossa was tasked to eliminate the knights guarding the emperor's flagship. Following that, the names of those who would participate in the raid were announced.

Shion, Souei, Ultima, and Carrera were the four who were confirmed for the raid. Naturally, Benimaru himself would also join them.

"Emperor Rudra probably won't make a move. But if he does, all we have to do is crush him. That is why we have to defeat Velgrynd-sama's 'Split Body' and the remaining seven 'Single Digit' members."

"Then it won't be enough if each of us takes care of one of them. Since it can't be helped, I'll handle two of them."

"If you want, I can even take out three of them," Shion boasted, but Benimaru calmed her down and continued to explain.

"Hold on a minute, Shion. Although you're correct, it's not good to take work away from those guys," said Benimaru, who turned his attention towards Veyron and the others who had been waiting for instructions with expectant looks.

"Listen, carelessness is one's worst enemy. We will attack with our maximum strength, leaving only the necessary numbers. Of course, we'll also have Testarossa-dono join us, would that be all right?"

"I couldn't have asked for more."

Upon hearing his words, Testarossa smiled lustrously. She had thought it would be an unbearable humiliation to end up on duty sweeping up the small fries. Unlike Ultima, she hadn't said it out loud, but if she had been ordered to stay behind, she would have been frustrated.

"I'll leave a hundred guards to make sure no one escapes from that airship. I want the remaining 500 devil chevaliers to head for Gabil and the others as their reinforcement... Who will command that force?"

"In that case, I believe Cien would be a good choice. He is familiar with Moss and is good at such chores."

Cien looked up when his name was called. His eyes were a little teary as he was happy that Testarossa remembered him.

"Very well. Now then, Cien, head over there right away."

"Yes, understood!"

Cien's actions were swift. He left behind a hundred of his men and flew off with the others. Thanks to those reinforcements, Gabil and the others escaped total annihilation.

![break]

And so, the plan was set.

Following Testarossa's preemptive attack, a select group of elites would enter the airship. This would be followed by blockade of the emperor's flagship by a hundred of the top devil chevaliers.

Benimaru, Shion, and Souei were the executives who would rush in. In addition to them, the three "devil lords" and four demon peers would enter the battle.

"Veyron, Agera, Esprit, and Zonda, be thankful for the chance you have been given," Carrera said, but it was her who seemed happier than anyone else.

"Kufufufufu. Well then, good luck to you all."

As soon as the plan was finalized, Diablo gave his salutations with a smile.

Testarossa was the first to respond, "Ufufufufu. Now then, if any of them survive my blessing, make sure you take care of them. Do not let a single one of them escape, understood?"

Testarossa turned to her subordinates and ordered them to serve as hounds. As for the demons, they didn't need to be told to do so, but none of them said so. Rather---they wondered if anyone could withstand the attacks of the current Testarossa to begin with. After ordering her subordinates she moved towards her prey.

Following that, Benimaru and the others took flight. Not to be left behind, Veyron and the others followed suit. The demons also spread out and finished positioning themselves around a single airship.

Soon, the decisive battle in the sky was about to begin.

![break]

At least, that's what everyone thought...

Ultima and Carrera were about to make their move when Ultima tilted her head as if suddenly remembering.

"So, what's Diablo going to do?"

When Ultima asked, Carrera turned to look at him, as if she, too, was interested to know.

Diablo stiffened. However, he didn't panic and answered with a smile.

"So you see, I have other *important* work to do."

Seeing that smile, the two of them grew more and more suspicious.

"Who is that 'rat' you were talking about earlier?" Carrera asked.

"That's not something you ladies need to know---"

"Hold on a minute. Diablo, do you think it's a good idea to keep secrets?"

"That's right. Even Rimuru-sama always says that sharing information is important."

Diablo had no choice but to divulge information after being cornered by that argument.

"I have the noble mission of watching over Rimuru-sama's courageous figure! This is a particularly important task, and I cannot leave it to you!!"

He had the audacity to say something so outrageous.

It was fortunate that Benimaru was not there. Since even he would have been taken aback. However, Ultima and Carrera were not convinced.

"What! I want to see Rimuru-sama in action too!!"

"Wait a minute, let's hear the details. Do you think you can be the only one who gets to enjoy such a role? I don't care if you're our boss, that's just too unreasonable."

It was a very natural reaction, Ultima thought. Why didn't she ask this question when Benimaru was around?

Carrera realized that the odds were against them. If Testarossa had been here, it would have been a different story, but with just Ultima and herself, there was no way they could do anything about Diablo.

"Oh, you appear to be dissatisfied, aren't you?"

"Of course we are!"

"I follow orders too, but I'm not convinced."

"Hmm...I guess it can't be helped," Diablo sighed. "So, let me tell you the truth. In fact, there is someone on the enemy side who can manipulate foreign space. I think it's probably Velgrynd-sama, so if you're trapped within it, your connection to this world may be cut off."

"!!"

"I see... In that case, it would certainly be better for someone to stay behind."

Diablo nodded meekly.

"That's how it is. As much as I'd like to join the fight, it's a shame."

In this way he could justify himself, Diablo snickered inwardly. His intellect was vainly efficient, and he was a master at making excuses. He was the dark companion Rimuru could rely on in times of need.

However, Ultima's ability to interrogate was also sharp.

"So, who's the rat?"

Tsk---Diablo inwardly clicked his tongue. He had been in a good mood at the prospect of observing the battle between Rimuru and Velgrynd, but his frustrations grew as these interlopers refused to leave.

"What a pity, Ultima. I had hoped that you would have noticed without me having to tell you..."

The little sarcasm was payback for that.

In any case, there was no need to hide anything, so he would answer honestly.

"It's Yuuki Kagurazaka. I also scouted out other presences, but none of them matched Yuuki. If he's hiding somewhere on the ship, then it's fine. However, if he's trying to interfere with Rimuru-sama, then he can't just be left alone, can he?"

"That's true. It would be disobeying Rimuru-sama's edict."

"Yeah, nobody should ever interfere."

"That's right. I don't know what the rat wants just yet, but at least one of us needs to stay here and watch over Rimuru-sama."

One half of Diablo desired to observe Rimuru's fight, while the other thought of the supposedly meaningful role he had to play. Ultimately, Diablo's desire won out. In any case, he was satisfied that Ultima and Carrera were convinced. In the end, they agreed with Diablo, albeit quite dissatisfied.

"Whatever. I'll just take my frustrations out on the people over there."

"Yes, go right ahead."

"No one will complain if I go on a rampage, right?"

"Of course. If anything, you can even finish off Rudra."

"Hmm, well that does sound like fun. In that case, I'll stop here."

"Yeah. I'll go on a rampage and get rid of this pent-up frustration!"

Yes, yes, Diablo nodded his head vigorously. If that was enough to convince them, then it was a small price to pay.

Carrera and Ultima left in a hurry, saying that if they were late, they would miss out on the best part.

"Please do your best."

Diablo sent them off with a big smile on his face. Then, he took off after Rimuru.

![break]

On the same spot after everyone had left.

Laplace thought to himself, *Nobody cares about me.* He felt a little lonely after being left behind.

"W-well then, I guess I'll go and help Kagali-sama..." Laplace mumbled, answering no one in particular, and left.

![break]

At the same time, unbeknownst to everyone, things were in motion.

In response to Rimuru's anger, the monsters began to evolve. They rebuilt their bodies at an incredible rate, acquiring new abilities---all of which were returned by the 'Food Chain' into 'accumulated power' without Rimuru even being aware.

Just like how Geld had awakened. The demons had evolved recklessly. Others who had yet to awaken would follow suit.

It was more than just an evolutionary awakening. It was efficiently managed and was a factor that would increase Rimuru's power. More effective and better suited for real-world combat. Beyond the limits that no one yet knows, Rimuru's power awaited its release...


![hard scene break]


At the bow of the emperor's flagship, there stood several men.

With Rudra at the lead, Kondou and Damrada stood behind him on either side. On the four sides of the ship, four knights from the third to sixth rank were on guard. Behind Kondou was Marco, and the rest of the Single Digit members were present. On Rudra's right, Velgrynd was in her fixed place. Her last 'Split Body' was standing by to protect Rudra if anything happened. However, the current Velgrynd, in order to concentrate on the battle with Rimuru, had leaned back against Rudra in the chair that had been set up for her, letting her consciousness fall back.

Rudra, who was gently stroking Velgrynd's blue hair, muttered in annoyance when he saw Demon Lord Rimuru on the move.

"He's something else. It was a lapse in judgment on my part. That slime should have been dealt with first."

Those words were tantamount to declaring that the battle was not over yet.

.........

......

...

Until just a moment ago, they had been celebrating the successful capture of Veldora. But now, there was no sign of such an atmosphere left. They had recognized Rimuru and the others as enemies. With the Demon Lord Rimuru at the head of the group, even the executive majins had returned. At this time, there was still room to spare.

"Hmph, to think they could escape from the Fortress of Dreams, I must have been a bit naive. They must have been desperate to come back because they lost their master, the source of their power."

Rudra said with a sneer. However, after Rimuru nullified Kondou's attack, Rudra took the situation seriously.

Above all, the demons that Rimuru had summoned posed a problem. Incarnated greater demons were a nuisance in and of themselves. And yet, Rimuru had increased the power of those demons.

Since it was unclear just what he had done, it was only natural to be wary.

.........

......

...

"Tatsuya, you didn't cut any corners, did you?"

"Of course not. The 'Remove' and 'Necrosis' both failed to work. Apparently, he is an opponent who cannot be defeated without a serious fight," Kondou replied, admitting he, too, had failed to see through Demon Lord Rimuru.

As Rudra had said, he judged that Rimuru was an extremely dangerous opponent. He had prioritized the capture of Veldora, but that had been a mistake. They should have taken them both at the same time, not one or the other.

Although he had come to that conclusion, the situation had already unfolded.

He knew that the Demon Lord Rimuru was an enemy with whom one could not be careless. That was why he had devised a plan to trap and later dispose of him. He had judged that if they took away Veldora, Rimuru's stronghold, then he would naturally succumb.

Yet now...

Kondou's judgment had backfired. Just as Rimuru was Veldora's trigger, so was Veldora's existence to Rimuru. Quickly realizing that he had pulled the trigger, Kondou had tried to kill Rimuru before anyone else. He unleashed the 'Remove' and 'Necrosis' bullets. Now that the 'Judgment' was no longer available, this combo was his strongest means of attack.

But the result was that he did not cause Rimuru any harm and could not even halt his actions. A demon lord deprived of Veldora, the source of his power, and now reduced to a powerless existence?

How laughable. A tyrannical will, enraged by the thought of losing his sworn friend.

That's what he should have thought. Far from cutting any corners, they would be defeated if they didn't take the challenge seriously---he concluded.

"If Tatsuya says that much, then even the four knights won't be able to win. I'll let Veldora deal with him and test his powers that I've acquired."

Rudra understood the threat of Rimuru without needing Kondou to tell him. The only reason he let him explain it was so that those present would share his understanding.

The Single Digits were a group of talented people gathered by Rudra. That is why, by making the enemy's threat known to all, he cautioned them not to make any mistakes. Rimuru was certainly a threat, but he could be dealt with provided they weren't careless. That said, he did not want to lose any of the force gathered here.

Rudra was being extremely cautious until the final grand showdown. He wanted to challenge Guy without losing any of his men. As things stood, victory was imminent.

The capture of Veldora had given the Empire a huge advantage. For Rudra, he was one step closer to putting an end to his long-standing game with Guy. He could not afford to make a mistake here. And so, Rudra decided to go all out and put Veldora up against Rimuru. Combined with Velgrynd's support, he was sure that nothing could go wrong.

In the meantime, it was up to Kondo and the others to deal with Rimuru's subordinates. There should be no problems. If possible, Rudra had wanted to take Rimuru under his command as well, but now that this was happening, there was no choice but to eliminate him. Now that he had Veldora, the main target, it was out of the question for a demon lord to disrupt his plans.

In the first place, a demon lord was a weak existence compared to the True Dragon race. This was why Rudra, while acknowledging Rimuru as a threat, believed that there was no way the mission could fail.

The True Dragons were the strongest beings in this world. Against two such True Dragons, Rimuru's defeat was inevitable.

However, there was only one thing that bothered him.

*...Back then, why did Veldora stop resisting my domination?*

That was his only question.

Given enough time, there was no doubt his domination would have succeeded anyway. It was possible to infer that Veldora had given up after realizing this. But to Rudra, that did not seem to be the only reason.

Through the 'Regalia Dominion,' Rudra had been able to feel Veldora's anger directly. As such, he understood that Veldora was not someone who gave up easily. Could it be that Veldora had been trying to protect something more important than himself?

Such doubts swirled in Rudra's mind. And if that was the case, what was it that was so important...

"No, there's no way."

Rudra shook his head in denial. For Veldora to prioritize the Demon Lord Rimuru, it was an assumption that Rudra could not accept...


![hard scene break]


Velgrynd returned to her human form and approached Veldora. She gently nuzzled his head and stroked his dragon scales.

"Good boy. The next time you wake up, you'll be one of us. Then I'll take very good care of you."

Velgrynd foresaw the end of the long game.

However, things would not be so simple...

![break]

Suddenly, Rimuru appeared. Velgrynd's mood dropped at the sight of this tactless interloper. At the same time, she felt a small sense of crisis. She wondered how he had escaped from that 'Fortress of Dreams.'

As Velgrynd pondered what to do, things began to take an unexpected turn. Rimuru had summoned a large number of demons and empowered them as if in a show of force. It was a provocation. In front of Velgrynd, he exposed his cards. It was too bold of an act, as if to say, 'Stop me if you can.'

And that wasn't all. Among the demons Rimuru had summoned were Testarossa and the others. She didn't know what he did, but they too had evolved into higher beings, 'devil lords.'

Sensing this, Velgrynd became very wary of Rimuru. In addition, there was another anomaly. The waves of Rimuru's anger were similar to those of her little brother, Veldora. Although still a demon lord, a mere slime was cloaked in the same haki as the True Dragon race. For Velgrynd, this was an unbelievable reality.

Even taking only that one point into account, there was no doubt that this was an abnormal situation. If she had only heard the report, she would have laughed it off as impossible. But now that she had seen it with her own eyes, she had no choice but to believe it.

Right before her eyes, this maiden-like demon lord was unleashing unbridled waves of fury without restraint. Those waves were clearly indicative of the danger. A human who was not resistant to these fluctuations would have died in an instant just from the exposure.

No, this was not limited to humans. Any higher beings, ones who were considered superior---any beings below the A rank defined by humans---would die without even being able to resist. It was an overwhelmingly powerful Demon Lord Haki, comparable to that of the True Dragon's.

*Now then, what should I do? To begin with, he was the one who even tamed those Primordials. I had thought that kid (Veldora) had been fooled by him, but it looks like I was seriously mistaken.*

If it was just Veldora, then it's possible that he was just being tricked with words. But that method would never have worked against those cunning and sophisticated Primordials.

Once understanding that, the plan would have to be reconsidered. It was clear from his 'Demon Lord Haki' that there was something about Demon Lord Rimuru. When one thought more about it, Veldora's growth was also astounding.

Three hundred years ago, it would have been impossible for him to even wound Velgrynd. But in the brief time since the seal had been lifted, he had become an extraordinarily skilled fighter. Veldora had grown far beyond Velgrynd's expectations. The reason for this must have also been the demon lord in front of her.

*I was planning to go back to my homeland and relax... But it can't be helped. If I don't get rid of him here, it will be a disaster for Rudra.*

Velgrynd made a decision. She would deal with this directly and crush Rimuru once and for all.

If she didn't kill him now, that slime would surely become a threat---that's what Velgrynd decided.

Although many magicules were consumed in the battle just now, Velgrynd was able to get them replenished from Veldora. As for Veldora, even though he had fought so fiercely, he had not exhausted his energy.

In other words, there would be no problem even if she fought at full power now. Velgrynd calmly shifted back into a fighting stance. She had discarded the feeling of victory, that everything had gone as planned. Such pride had led to the current situation.

If she had disposed of Rimuru in the Fortress of Dreams at that time, Rimuru would not have summoned the demons. That would have left only the final battle to be fought. In that light, the current situation was not good, but it was not the worst either. She still had a good chance to win, and as long as she made the right moves, she should be able to handle the situation without any problems.

However, there was an anticlimactic turn of events. Contrary to Velgrynd's expectations, Rimuru was the only one who came at her.

*I've won. If they had all come at me, even I would have had some trouble.*

No matter how much of a threat Rimuru was, she and Veldora would not be defeated if they both took on the enemy---she was convinced.

However, the game had to be finished at once. If the demon lord's subordinates got in the way, the battle could drag on. Before that happened, Velgrynd chose to fight a short and decisive battle. It was Velgrynd who was acting according to her instincts.

<Rudra! Give Veldora the order to attack Demon Lord Rimuru with all his might.>

<Hm. So then you also feel the danger of that person as I do? In that case, there's no need to hesitate. Veldora, get rid of the enemy before you!!>

In response to Velgrynd's request, Rudra activated the 'Regalia Dominion.'

Velgrynd was relieved to see that Rudra considered Rimuru as dangerous as she did. As long as Rudra was on his guard, victory seemed certain. With two of the supreme True Dragons challenging the enemy at the same time, defeat was unthinkable.

A terrifying battle was about to begin.


![hard scene break]


Rimuru flew towards Velgrynd, who was standing tall and composed. Ahead of Rimuru, Veldora roared into the sky. The atmosphere shook at the fierce impact, and Veldora flew out. Velgrynd also followed.

She roared as if confident in her victory. And with that, an attack was launched to annihilate Rimuru. Veldora was going at full strength from the start. The same converging storm attack that had tormented Velgrynd---the roar of destruction 'Storm Blast'---attacked Rimuru.

![break]

<<Notice. Predicting the convergent storm attack. 'Absolute Defense' of the Ultimate Skill 'Covenant King Uriel' will neutralize each wavelength and invalidate--->>

![break]

The 'Wisdom King Raphael' automatically tried to take defensive action, but Rimuru gave it a compulsory order.

<Idiot! Evade it!!>

The Wisdom King Raphael immediately obeyed the order, but a part of its computational domain was unable to gauge Rimuru's intentions. The 'Absolute Defense' counterattack that it had proposed was supposed to be the best solution amongst the numerous patterns of behavior. The fact that this was denied by Rimuru made it a little unsettling.

Although its reaction was limited to an exceedingly small area of the computational domain, the 'Wisdom King Raphael' was indeed confused. It was not uncommon for Rimuru to ignore the opinions of Wisdom King Raphael, but this time was different. Such a feeling could only be felt by the 'Wisdom King Raphael' because it had known Rimuru for a long time.

However, it was abnormal for a part of the world's laws, a Skill, to have such emotions...but the party concerned was not aware of this fact...

The 'Storm Blast' grazed Rimuru who had taken a forceful evasive action. Immediately after that, the 'Absolute Defense' that normally protected Rimuru was penetrated, and an explosion occurred in the place where Rimuru had been just a short while ago. The 'Storm Blast' had unleashed its destructive power. Had the evasive action been delayed, his injury would have been inevitable.

Witnessing this, the level of confusion in 'Wisdom King Raphael' increased.

![break]

---Calculation failure? Unforeseen situation? Unable to comprehend---

![break]

How did Rimuru know that? The result of the calculation was perfect, there was no mistake. Wisdom King Raphael began to scan the information, wondering if it had overlooked some condition. Even after computing at a speed that surpassed that of a quantum computer, the cause was still unknown.

![break]

<<Confusion. It should have been 100 percent defensible according to predictions.>>

![break]

Unintentionally, words that didn't need to be said leaked out.

Seemingly impossible, it was the 'Wisdom King Raphael' trying to justify itself. A mere Skill uttering excuses was something that should not be possible. However, no one noticed this. They were in the middle of a battle, and this was not the time for casual verification. The confused 'Wisdom King Raphael' received a reprimand from Rimuru.

<This is no time to be stupid! Veldora has the 'Investigation King Faust'. As I recall, there was an ability called 'Probability Manipulation' or something troublesome like that, right?>

Upon hearing that, the 'Wisdom King Raphael' came to its senses. Yes, that was true. How could it have forgotten such an important thing? It was strange---just then, 'Wisdom King Raphael' felt something unusual. It could only assume that it was being interfered with by someone. However, the exact cause remained unknown.

'Wisdom King Raphael' hesitated, wondering if it should tell Rimuru about it. It did not want to admit to Rimuru that the cause was unknown out of pride. However, if nothing was done, there was a strong possibility that Rimuru would be harmed. It knew that it had to tell him, and the results of its calculations told it so. But---for the 'Wisdom King Raphael,' being branded as incompetent by Rimuru was the same as losing its meaning of existence.

Thinking of such a thing in itself was an act of betrayal to its lord. For a Skill to be so lost, it was something that should never have happened...

As the 'Wisdom King Raphael' was plunged into violent confusion, Rimuru's words flowed in.

<Veldora is an absurdity. It's no wonder he can outperform even your perfect calculations. More importantly, don't get upset just because you made a small mistake. Veldora can't be predicted. You don't have to worry about it either! Don't think. Believe in yourself. I'll deal with Veldora, so you should deal with Velgrynd!>

'Just knowing that is good enough' Rimuru said. He spoke to the Wisdom King Raphael, who was only a Skill, as if he were treating it as a true partner...

<So please? There are two of them, but there are also the two of us. If you hold off Velgrynd, I'll find an opening to free Veldora in the meantime. That's why, please hang on at all costs, okay? I'm counting on you, partner!>

Those words soothed the confused and empty thoughts of 'Wisdom King Raphael.'

Being relied upon? Even though a mistake was made?

Rimuru still believed in the 'Wisdom King Raphael,' who was constantly making mistakes.

![break]

---Ahh!! This lord still needs 'me,' who is nothing more than a computational power---

![break]

The anxiety had already disappeared. Regaining its usual confidence, the Wisdom King Raphael responded.

![break]

<<Done. Understood. From here on, the individual Velgrynd will be intercepted.>>

![break]

Yes, that's right.

Rimuru---the beloved master of the Wisdom King Raphael, was not such a small being that he could be bound by something as uncertain as 'probability.' Therefore, it could be at ease and follow him with faith.

In that moment, Rimuru casually announced.

<...Come to think of it, I've never called you by a proper name. I usually call you 'Wisdom King Raphael-san' or partner, or whatever I feel like. I'm sorry if it's a little bit weird at a time like this, but I'm officially giving you a 'name.'>

---?!

The 'Wisdom King Raphael' found this incomprehensible. The 'Wisdom King Raphael' was filled with a strange sensation. It was bewilderment. It was rapture. It was---an outpouring of emotions.

The Wisdom King could not hide its confusion at the incalculable uncertainties that had sprung up inside it.

*What was Master saying?* Wisdom King Raphael was confused. But at the same time, it also realized Rimuru's intentions.

Ahh... He was worried after noticing my poor condition. He must have been more saddened than anyone else by the loss of Veldora. And yet, in spite of that, he still cared for others. Rimuru was that kind of a person.

<Well then, how about "Ciel"?>

![break]

<<!!!!!!!!!!>>

![break]

<You've always taught me so much, so I'll call you "Ciel" for short. What do you think? It may not be satisfactory, but just bear with it. If you have any complaints, go take it out on that red dragon!>

Rimuru remarked, as if he were hiding his embarrassment.

![break]

The 'Wisdom King Raphael'---no, "Ciel" experienced a fullness of emotion that a Skill could not have otherwise felt.

![break]

---Ahh, I^[Ciel started with a katakana watashi then to kanji to symbolize its transformation from a mere skill to a manas with a mind of its own.] am now in eternal bliss---

![break]

Yes, that's what it thought.

In that same moment, the time of evolution had arrived. This was the moment when the Manas "Ciel" was born from the Ultimate Skill 'Wisdom King Raphael.'

![break]

<<I, I am Ciel. A Manas^[A Manas is also described as a 'theosophy nucleus.'], the unifier of Skills. I am with the 'soul' of Rimuru-sama (Master), and the one who provides support to my lord. Rimuru-sama, I look forward to working with you from here on.>>

![break]

Ciel thought. There was nothing to be afraid of anymore. Even in a crisis situation, it did not feel dangerous.

<O-oh. Same here, I'm looking forward as well?>

The mere sound of Rimuru's voice filled Ciel with a sense of euphoria.

<In that case, show them what you can do!>

For Ciel, Rimuru's command was the highest reward.

![break]

<<As you command, my lord!!>>

![break]

The Wisdom King Raphael had awakened and became Ciel. And then, in order to fulfill Rimuru's wishes, its power blossomed even more sharply.


![hard scene break]


As Rimuru ordered, the 'Wisdom King Raphael', now 'Ciel', set out to intercept Velgrynd.

The 'Absolute Defense' of 'Covenant King Uriel' effortlessly prevented Velgrynd's approaching 'Burning Breath.'

When Velgrynd saw this, she was dumbfounded by the ridiculous situation. Naturally, Velgrynd had not gone easy on Rimuru. The 'Burning Breath' was strengthened by 'Charity King Raguel', and there was no way a mere 'Barrier' would be able to prevent it. In fact, unless he was a superior opponent who could see through the attack perfectly, there must be some kind of pay off from the blow.

And yet, Rimuru showed no signs of exhaustion. It was impossible even for the three primordial demonesses to withstand an attack from Velgrynd's Dragon Mode and remain unscathed. The fact that Rimuru was able to do such a thing without hesitation meant that this demon lord could not be attacked half-heartedly.

Velgrynd felt uncomfortable but continued to think calmly. Because she had more magicules than him, it was possible that she was losing in terms of skill quality. It was also possible that Demon Lord Rimuru was completely immune to heat attacks.

Velgrynd decided to keep trying instead of worrying about it. She made partial 'Split Bodies' appear, as she had done to Veldora, and deployed eleven rays of light---Nuclear magic Nuclear Cannon. On top of that, the eleven heads all emitted Burning Breath simultaneously.

This multi-stage attack, consisting of twenty-two heat rays, was so hot that it could easily vaporize an asteroid. If Rimuru was able to survive this, it would prove that thermal attacks were ineffective.

The result was something that Velgrynd did not want to admit. The heat rays that had crossed to block Rimuru's escape route converged on him. Every single one was repelled by a shield of light that Rimuru had created.

*Tsk, damn it! It's as if it's all calculated, perfectly defended with the most minimal of movements!*

This was not funny, Velgrynd thought indignantly. On top of the fact that thermal attacks were useless against Rimuru, Velgrynd couldn't forgive the fact that her current attack had practically been meaningless. If she had been able to wear him down even a little, the absolute difference in magicule quantity would have been enough to secure Velgrynd's victory. However, at present, Rimuru's energy consumption rate was equal to zero.

In this situation, Velgrynd might be the one to get exhausted first. Realizing this, Velgrynd decided to get serious.

Besides, there was another unpleasant fact. Rimuru had only given Velgrynd a glance in the beginning, and then didn't even look at her after that. He concentrated on Veldora and did not even look at Velgrynd.

He did not use his shield against Veldora and avoided all attacks. It was only when there was nothing he could do, that he tried to offset them with the same kind of attack. And yet, when faced with Velgrynd's attacks, he merely deflected them with only his shield of light.

Even though he was able to perceive his entire surroundings through 'Magic Perception', he was clearly ignoring her. This was tantamount to declaring that Velgrynd was not a threat.

This irritated her to no end.

*You will regret making a fool out of me!!*

The proud Velgrynd decided to unleash the most powerful attack she could muster.

![break]

While looking hatefully at Rimuru who was still ignoring her, Velgrynd condensed a large amount of mana. Then she applied it throughout her own body. She applied the "support" of the Ultimate Skill 'Charity King Raguel', and the power of 'acceleration' symbolized by her own heat affinity. If these were activated in parallel and used on herself, she would be able to forcefully increase her heat, that is, her momentum.

This made Velgrynd capable of moving at a speed several thousand times faster than the speed of sound, the fastest physical action in the world.

So then, what would happen if the target of this power was someone other than herself? The increase in momentum was not a problem for Velgrynd, who was a spiritual life form with physical resistance, but was there really anyone else who could withstand this?

The answer was no. No matter what kind of life form the other was, their body would not be able to endure a forced continuous acceleration. The same was true for spiritual life forms, where even information was converted into energy, eventually leading to thermal decay. And that was exactly what Velgrynd meant when she said:

"Die! Not even a single piece of flesh will be left on your body as it crumbles away! 'Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration'!!"

This was her most powerful technique that surpassed even the 'Burning Embrace.' The 'Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration' contained Velgrynd's full power. It was a secret technique she had devised for Velzard in the coming day of the final showdown.

Normally, it would be too much of a waste to show this to a mere demon lord, but the furious Velgrynd didn't care about that.

With the roar of the crimson dragon, the "surge of destruction" was unleashed on Rimuru. The ultimate blow of the Scorch Dragon, as if to show Velgrynd's pride in being the fastest, would cause all matter to collapse in an instant.

It would bury the enemy with a speed that no one could avoid. By the time Rimuru, who was focused on Veldora, could notice what was happening, it would be too late. No, he would disappear from this world before he even had time to understand what was going on.

*I had wanted to make him regret underestimating me, but I didn't have the time for that. That is the only thing I regret*.

With that level of absolute certainty, Velgrynd began to confirm the results of her attack.

*---?!*

Upon seeing Rimuru standing there unharmed, Velgrynd was completely stunned.

'No way, that's impossible'---she even doubted her own eyes.

There was no way anyone could withstand such an inescapable, absolute blow completely unscathed. Even if it was Demon Lord Guy Crimson or Velgrynd's sister, Velzard the Frost Dragon, Velgrynd thought that it was powerful enough to bring them down.

"...Unharmed? That's not possible. My 'Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration' is capable of affecting all 'Barriers' and defensive Skills! What did you do?!"

Velgrynd was agitated. It would be plausible if it was offset by some other means, but it should have been impossible to nullify it with a 'Barrier' or such. Velgrynd's composure was shaken by the incomprehensible reality.

"Hmm." Rimuru replied. "That move was indeed dangerous, but it was a straightforward attack, so it was easy to eat, you know?"

Actually, the response to Velgrynd was all thanks to Ciel. It had guided Velgrynd's attack in a brilliantly calculated manner. Ciel prioritized Rimuru over everything else. It completely shut down Velgrynd as it was commanded, so as not to get in Rimuru's way. The nature of the attack was analyzed with 'Analyze and Assess' and the effective measures were selected and implemented.

One of those measures was using the shield of light, which had a special effect on Velgrynd's abilities. The current Ciel was worthy of its moniker as the unifier of Skills, and even all of Rimuru's Ultimate Skills were under its control.

What Ciel had just done was use 'Predation' from the 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth'. It instantly understood Velgrynd's 'Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration' and prevented the attack's influence by 'isolating' it into the 'Stomach' which had now evolved into the 'Imaginary Space.'

The attack just now was certainly capable of destroying Rimuru. It would have been impossible to defend it by normal means, and even the computing power of the 'Wisdom King Raphael' would not have been able to deal with it.

But Ciel was different. Now that it was no longer a mere Skill, it had evolved into an existence that was a whole new kind of different from the likes of 'Wisdom King Raphael' and others. No matter what the enemy's attack was, it would not be a problem if one could correctly identify its nature. As if to prove this, Ciel mastered the 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' perfectly.

After 'isolating' the attack, the energy could be absorbed into the 'Imaginary Space'. In this way, the 'Imaginary Space' of the 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' had been transformed into a defensive measure that surpassed even the 'Absolute Defense' of the 'Covenant King Uriel'.

It was no wonder that Velgrynd was surprised. After all, everything happened long before even Rimuru himself could think how dangerous the attack was. It was only in order to keep Velgrynd from sensing this that he responded to her in that provocative tone.

This was not the end of Ciel's scheme. It worked with Rimuru more smoothly than ever before, using even conversation as a weapon to hunt down Velgrynd.

And Velgrynd was---

*Don't be stupid! You're saying you ate it? You ate my most powerful technique, the Scorch Dragon 'Cardinal Acceleration'?!*

Even though she was in the middle of a battle, she couldn't understand Rimuru's words and was stunned. Although it was only for a moment, it was a fatal blunder.

"It's too bad that you're in shock from your attack failing, but you haven't forgotten that you're in the middle of a battle, have you?"

By the time he asked this, it was already too late.

Ciel's actions were flawless, and Rimuru approved of them all.

![break]

<<Measurement of Velgrynd's magicule count is complete. Taking into consideration her nature and the characteristics of her powers, it has been determined that she can be sealed for several hundred seconds in an 'Insulation Prison'. Now activating!>>

![break]

Before Velgrynd realized it, the multi-layered magic circle had been completed. It was a synthesized skill from the combination of 'Infinite Prison' and 'Insulated Space' of the Ultimate Skill 'Covenant King Uriel'. Ciel had created it just now to be used against Velgrynd. Velgrynd was trapped inside of it.

This battle airspace was already under Ciel's computational control. Temperature, humidity, gravity, the flow of wind, the light of the sun, the pulse of life---all of these things were in the palm of Ciel's hand.

Therefore, no matter what Velgrynd did, it was impossible for her to leave this airspace. The glow of the 'Insulation Prison,' activated after Ciel's declaration, and made Velgrynd feel dizzy.

*Am I really going down just like this?!*

The crimson dragon trembled in humiliation at being defeated by Rimuru. However, no matter what Velgrynd did, the 'Insulation Prison' would not budge.

"Just keep quiet for a while! I'll play with you once I free Veldora."

Those words signaled Velgrynd's defeat.

*I'll admit defeat this time, but I still have Parallel Existence. With Soul Corridor, this 'Insulation Prison' won't be a problem!*

There was still one thing Velgrynd could do. She would have to give up her current body, but she could put most of her energy back into the 'Split Body' she had left by Rudra's side as insurance.

So it wasn't over yet, and Velgrynd, while enduring the full humiliation, began to move cautiously. Slowly, so as not to be noticed by Rimuru.

Her magicules were gradually transferred through the Soul Corridor.

Completely unaware that this was exactly what Ciel wanted all along...


![hard scene break]


As expected of 'Wisdom King Raphael.' Oh wait, it's Ciel now. Somehow, it hadn't seemed to be in the best shape, so I had given it a name on a whim...but it seemed to be more pleased than I expected.

In fact, its response was not as mechanical as it had been before, but rather exceptionally smooth and human-like. I also felt that Ciel had become scarily stronger.

Ciel was in such good shape now that it was hard to believe that it had even been in a slump just recently.

There had been a few times before when it had gone into auto-battle mode, but this time it was utilizing the Skills to a much greater degree. Even the seemingly overwhelming Velgrynd was no match for Ciel. It was a perfect strategy designed by Ciel, in which it had boldly launched a special move, aiming for the moment when the magicule count decreased.

By combining my Skills with the effects corresponding to the target's characteristics, it was able to achieve this. That was easy enough to say, but the amount of computing power it would actually take to make this possible was completely beyond me.

After all, I was at a greatly significant disadvantage in magicule count. In order to contain such a superior opponent, Ciel had efficiently constructed an "insulated prison" with only superior attributes. In other words, this could also be called a *calculation prison* that operated according to the enemy's characteristics.

The fact that Ciel was able to achieve this was the reason for its complete victory. The key to this strategy was whether or not we could withstand Velgrynd's attack. I trusted Ciel's calculation, but if it had read things wrong, I would have been the one who was finished.

Why did I trust it so much?

That was simple. It was because my opponent was Veldora, and I had declared that I would let Ciel handle Velgrynd. Besides, I knew that Ciel could do it. And it lived up to my expectations perfectly---no, even more than I could have imagined. It used my Skills more skillfully than I ever could and fulfilled its role. As expected of my partner, I thought of Ciel as such more than ever.

![break]

An unexpected miscalculation had made Ciel more reliable, but I must not forget my purpose. I had to free Veldora before Velgrynd began moving. So, how many seconds could she be held back?

![break]

<<Even if Velgrynd goes wild, the 'Insulation Prison' can still be maintained for the remaining 200 seconds. However, worrying about that is unnecessary.>>

![break]

Uh, why? I was grateful for just the 200 seconds, but Velgrynd is still a threat. I can't ignore her...

![break]

<<No. As planned, Velgrynd has turned to evasive action. I knew it was possible for her to transfer energy using the Soul Corridor, so it is expected for her to flee without worrying about this 'Split Body'.>>

![break]

I see. Since any 'Split Body' can be the main body, there is no need to forcefully break the 'Insulation Prison.'

No, that's not it. Ciel had prepared an escape path in anticipation of this. That's right... Velgrynd had shown too much of her hand. She showed off 'Parallel Existence' and fought the three demon girls and Veldora and so on. All of these situations had been monitored, so Ciel must have had no shortage of material to analyze.

Velgrynd's 'Parallel Existence' was not an inexhaustible source. Therefore, Ciel may have succeeded in deducing the total amount of Velgrynd's magicules by measuring it. Once that was known, it was possible to figure out how many more 'Split Bodies' they must face to defeat her.

Ciel, instead, took advantage of this. It had seen through Velgrynd's insurance policy and induced her into using it as a method of escape. After all, if I had such a useful power, I would use it as a means of insurance, too. However, it was impossible for my 'Clone' to reproduce an Ultimate Skill. It was a little disappointing, but I was willing to admit defeat in that aspect.

In the end, while the 'Parallel Existence' seemed completely versatile, it could only be used as a decoy or against lower-ranked opponents. Well, it was still extremely useful as insurance, and it could be a great asset depending on the opponent. I could think of many ways to use it, but it seemed to be ineffective against opponents of the same rank or higher.

Ciel had uncovered that weakness. I mean, its computational power was a bit scary.

Everything was going according to Ciel's plan, as if it was predicting the future.

I couldn't help but be amazed at how far it has come, but Ciel was my partner. Better to stop worrying about unnecessary things and quickly get on with what we had to do.

Ciel had managed to make even Velgrynd---of the supreme True Dragon race---dance in the palm of her hands.

Hm, in that case, I can't lose.

<All right. But just to be safe, I'll do everything I can to deal with Veldora so that we can wrap this up in under 200 seconds. Give me a hand, Ciel!>

![break]

<<As you wish!>>

![break]

I---no, Ciel and I faced Veldora directly, which had been the original goal. This was precious time that Ciel had earned. It may be short, but it was infinite to us. It would be a shame on us if we couldn't make the most of it. It wasn't a question of whether we could or couldn't do it, but that we would do it.

With that resolve, I resumed my assault on Veldora.


![hard scene break]


I would liberate Veldora and take down Rudra. This was what I wanted to do, not just something that Guy requested.

I had been surprised by the birth of Ciel, but I switched back to my usual self. I was already calm now. But that didn't mean my anger was gone. I decided to save this anger until I could take it out on Emperor Rudra. The main priority had to come first.

That being said, about Veldora... What I was trying to do was to talk to Veldora. Controlling Veldora was simple to say, but it would take an enormous amount of effort to bend a massive energy source such as a True Dragon to your will. In the first place, it would be extremely difficult to take away the free will of a spiritual life form.

As I saw it, there were several types of domination.

Charm control, where the person submitted wholeheartedly.

Coercive control, where free will was taken away and the person was forced to obey.

Complete control, where the person was not even aware that they were being controlled.

And so on.

In Yuuki's case, it was complete control, but in Kagali's case, it was coercive control. And Veldora's case was also coercive control.

There were distinct stages of coercive control. There were various patterns, from those who still had free will and resisted, to those whose free will had been erased and they became robots that never disobeyed orders.

Kagali didn't appear to have any free will left, but what about Veldora? Spiritual life forms were known for their strong wills. I didn't think the free will of such an existence could be erased so easily, so I thought it would be meaningful to call out to him.

However, Veldora's resistance was too intense. I suppose his orders were to eliminate the enemy---me, but he didn't even hesitate at all and attacked viciously. Even if I had left Velgrynd to Ciel, Veldora alone would have been trouble.

I still had my storm-based powers, so I could cancel out Veldora's attacks. However, it was too much for me to call out to him, as it took too much effort to cancel out those unbelievably powerful attacks. That was why I now decided to leave the defense to Ciel. The main problem was his 'Probability Manipulation', but I trusted that the current Ciel could handle it.

From now on, it's showtime---I thought to myself as I approached Veldora.

![break]

The storm raged about. But the place where I was remained as calm as the eye of a storm. Somehow, I felt a powerful sense of security. Veldora's attacks were canceled out, without me feeling as desperate as I had been before. There was little to no consumption of magicules. Moreover, I was in ridiculously good shape right now.

![break]

<<Of course. Through the Soul Corridor, the monsters under your command have sent their 'Tribute' through 'Food Chain'.>>

![break]

I see, so that's what it was!

I felt a surge of energy in my body earlier, but thanks to my friends, I was able to fight Veldora. Now that I knew that, I couldn't afford to make any mistakes here. Once I finally reached Veldora, I called out to him, "Sorry to keep you waiting, Veldora. Do you recognize me?"

There was no response. Rather, I got 'Thunderstorm' in return.

I was so annoyed that I couldn't help but punch him. However, or perhaps I should say naturally, it didn't work on Veldora's massive body. Unless I put not only my strength but also my magicules into it, I would not be able to do much damage. However, this was fine. My goal was to wake up Veldora, so I wouldn't hesitate to beat him up.

I kept hitting Veldora in the face as hard as I could. Once I was this close, most of his attacks would be out of range. On the contrary, it was too close that if he attacked, it would hit him as well. Well, since he was being controlled, he might shoot magic at me without caring about that, but Ciel would take care of that.

I punched and punched, and gave an occasional kick. But Veldora only roared...

![break]

<<How about using 'Predation' on Veldora and sealing him in 'Imaginary Space'?>>

![break]

Ciel made a terrifying proposal.

If I had to choose between 'yes' or 'no', I would say 'yes', but... Was such a thing even possible?

![break]

<<No problem. The 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' has been placed under my command, so it can be executed immediately upon your order.>>

![break]

How reliable...I must say.

'Predation' was a slime's Intrinsic Skill, and 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' was the result of its evolution to the limit. It had the highest affinity with me and was the easiest power for me to handle.

Ciel had optimized it, so it should work for Veldora as well. In addition, this 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' could be activated from anywhere in my Demon Slime body. In fact, I didn't even need to touch the target. As long as I could visually confirm, I could affect that space. Its power increases with proximity, so now that I was closer to Veldora, I could expect a significant effect.

In any case, the decision was made.

"You're a pain in the ass, Veldora! Don't make me worry!"

As soon as I shouted that, I tried devouring Veldora with 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' without hesitation.

At the same time:

<Kuahahaha! It was a small mistake. Forgive me!>

I heard a voice I wasn't supposed to hear.

<Veldora, right?>

<Hm, it's me. Your sworn friend, the Storm Dragon Veldora!>

This couldn't be a trap. Because that response was so ridiculous. The owner of that cheerful voice could only be Veldora.

<Hey, are you still conscious?>

<Mm. To tell you the truth, I quickly detached my *heart* at that time. It was impossible to talk, but it did preserve my ego!>

So that's it. He couldn't speak, but his consciousness still remained. Was it because the 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' got to Veldora's body, that we could use 'telepathy' through our *hearts?*

In any case, I was glad that he was safe. But that also made me angry in another sense.

<What?! Then hurry up and take your body back!>

Don't be so carefree after making me worry so much.

How upset I had been because of Veldora... Thinking about it made me want to complain.

<If I could do that, I would have done so long ago! Rather than that, Rimuru, shouldn't you have been calmer and acted more cautiously?>

Speak for yourself. Not to mention...

<You idiot! If I'd been calm, I would never have been so reckless as to take on two True Dragons at the same time!>

I didn't need him to point that out to me.

After I had calmed down, I thought to myself that I was lucky to be alive. However, it would have been impossible for me to act cautious at that time. Cautious was not a word that could be used when dealing with True Dragons in the first place.

As I was thinking about this, Veldora happily warned me.

<Oh, look out. I'm about to unleash my Black Lightning!>

Don't say that so casually as if it were small talk!

Moreover, it wasn't Black Lightning that was fired, but the Death-Calling Wind. In any case, Ciel canceled it out and we successfully avoided it, but what was the point in lying?!

<You! What lightning?! That's the death-calling wind that destroys souls!!>

I was annoyed and complained, but Veldora laughed and gave me an excuse.

<Mmm?! My bad, Kuahahaha! It seems that I still don't fully understand my own body. I was able to get a sense of activating a technique, but the accuracy rate is only 50 percent.>

In other words, it was not helpful.

The enemy also has 'Probability Manipulation', so it would be safer to just ignore Veldora's predictions.

<Got it. That's enough, so you just shut up. It won't be funny if I fail at this critical moment by trusting some random statement, will it?>

Hearing me express my disappointment, Veldora began to panic.

<Wait, wait Rimuru! I-I'll do my best. I will help you out somehow!>

Despite his desperate assurances, there was no basis for his remarks. This was a time where reason should prevail over emotion. Besides, I had already been assisted by him. Just hearing Veldora's voice was enough to calm me down.

<As long as you're okay, that's all that matters.>

After making sure that he was safe once again, Veldora laughed loudly as usual.

<Kuahahaha! Of course I'm okay. I am the strongest dragon!>

I was relieved to hear that. And just as I was thinking that...

<To begin with, it wasn't Rudra who cut off the Soul Corridor, but me. That means I didn't actually lose to them!>

Huh? What is he talking about, this old man...

<What do you mean?>

<Well, it's simple. Rudra tried to take control of me while I was focused on Kondou's attack. The fact that three people, including my sister, actually joined forces is just a dirty ploy---I was outraged. But I made the difficult decision to at least avoid the worst-case scenario.>

As the 'strongest dragon' isn't he being a little too careless? On the battlefield, there is no such thing as clean or dirty...

<Don't be so arrogant! Honestly, what the hell are you doing? Didn't I always tell you not to let your guard down?!>

<Kuahahaha! I didn't expect to be lectured in this situation!>

I couldn't help but be taken aback by Veldora's seemingly endless enjoyment.

He's an idiot, so I'll just move on.

<So, that decision was to cut off the Soul Corridor?>

<Yes, that's right. Because Rudra's domination would have affected not only me, but also you through the Soul Corridor.>

So, he had rushed to cut off the Soul Corridor to protect me.

Once I heard that, I couldn't be mad at Veldora anymore.

<Well then, just leave it to me!>

<Mm! I won't worry about a thing, because I believe in you.>

Well, it's never a bad thing to be relied upon.

<Ah, that's right. I'll set you free soon, so just wait here.>

<Kuahahahaha! How reliable. I have the utmost faith in you, my friend Rimuru!>

The situation with Veldora was clear. He had lost control of his body, but his *heart* was safe. It seems that Veldora couldn't take back control now, so I would have to do something about it.

That's right, for example:

<Ciel, if you have Veldora's *heart*, can you revive the Ultimate Skill 'Storm King Veldora'?>

![break]

<<No problem. The information of the power remains, so as long as the Soul Corridor is connected to Veldora's *heart*, the Ultimate Skill 'Storm King Veldora' can be restored.>>

![break]

The problem was easily solved. In short, all I had to do was eat up the Veldora in front of me and recover his *heart*. The rest was just a matter of getting it done.

Now then, let's defeat him. The strongest opponent, Storm Dragon Veldora!!


![soft scene break]


The solution to the problem has been found. In that case, I'll just get it over with quickly. There were two problems. The time limit and the location of the *heart*.

There was still plenty of time. The current conversation had been prolonged by 'Thought Acceleration', so in fact not more than a few seconds had passed. There were still more than three minutes left, although there was actual offense and defense going on in between.

The problem was the location of the *heart*. It was inside the body, so 'telepathy' should be possible through magicules. Nevertheless, it was difficult to pinpoint the location.

If I accidentally destroyed the *heart*, it was all over. The mission would fail, and Veldora would have to be reborn. On the contrary, it would normally be more difficult to damage the *heart*. That was because it was the most protected part of the body. However, Veldora's *heart* was detached from his main body right now, so it was unprotected. If I had been careless and believed that I would not hit it, I could have accidentally hit and damaged it, which would have been unfortunate. Veldora would be released from Rudra's control, but his current personality would disappear, and our 'Soul Corridor' would not be restored. Only that situation had to be avoided.

If I could devour Veldora in one go, I wouldn't have to worry about this. Unfortunately, it was impossible to swallow Veldora whole in my 'Imaginary Space' without consent. I could weaken him and reduce the amount of magicules to some extent, or I could use 'Predation' little by little and be careful not to hurt his *heart*...

Looking at it this way, damaging him was out of the question. In fact, I was a little scared now when I thought about the beating I just gave him... It was difficult to think of Veldora as so fragile as I had thought he would be difficult to defeat or even damage. A shot or two of magic would not even scratch him and punching and kicking would be useless. Only by adding the effects of an Ultimate Skill to the various attacks would I be able to do any real damage at all. Even the most powerful holy magic, 'Disintegration,' could only do insignificant damage to Veldora's massive body.

This showed that the high durability of the True Dragon race was not a fluke. That's why he should have been able to withstand a few attacks, but there was always a chance. Especially now, Veldora was in a state of rampage without will. There was no telling what he would do, which was the sad thing about being controlled.

Unless I learned where Veldora's *heart* was, it would be safer for me not to attack him.

In that case, there was only one way. I had no choice but to do my best to find the *heart* by using 'predation' little by little. It was a race against time, but there was no other choice. There was only three minutes, but three minutes was three minutes.

Without worrying about how much time I had left, I activated the 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' at full power and bit down on Veldora---

![break]

My body returned from its human form to its slime form. Rather than a fluid form, it revealed the properties of an amorphous viscous body. Following my aggressive 'Predation' intentions, I changed into the most suitable shape that Ciel had optimized for me. It would be more efficient since there were many contact surfaces.

My fluctuating body ate its way through the surface of Veldora's body, wrapping around it. However, the target was too big. No matter how much I stretched my body, from Veldora's point of view, I was a mere dot. It was a daunting task, but I couldn't give up here. I accelerated the aggressive erosion without hesitation.

At the same time, I activate the 'Soul Eater' to probe for Veldora's nucleus. This would have been impossible without Ciel's assistance. As I had thought from its extraordinary strength, perhaps Ciel had acquired computing power that could not be compared to that of the Wisdom King Raphael. It appears that evolution upon getting a name was not limited to monsters.

Now, thanks to Ciel, things were going well, but it wasn't without obstacles. I mean, I was in a lot of pain right now. Veldora's body had begun to resist the hostile presence. The 'Dragon Spirit Haki' of the Storm Dragon was disintegrating my body.

Between me, who was trying to devour, and the Storm Dragon who was trying to eliminate me---a fierce clash began.


![soft scene break]


It hurts, it's hot, it's painful. I shouldn't be feeling any pain, but an intense pain pierced my entire body. The heat should have been meaningless, but I felt as if I were melting at an unbearably high temperature. And then there was the agonizing suffering that I had felt for the first time in this world. The dangerous sensation that I was about to be wiped out of existence stimulated my survival instincts.

However, I would not let go of the erosion. I will win. I will overcome this suffering and save Veldora. Besides, I'm not alone right now. I have a reliable partner in Ciel. I was going to devour the Storm Dragon and absorb Veldora's *heart*. For that, this level of suffering would be nothing.

<Ciel, is that okay?>

![break]

<<Leave it to me.>>

![break]

It'll be fine. After that reliable answer, I further expanded the erosion.

The only thing standing in my way was the energy I consumed. Normally, it would be restored as my own power, but with the True Dragon race, it was different. Instead of helping me, it was destroying my body.

I suppose the Dragon Factor was so powerful that it couldn't be bound by anyone. Yet, he was being controlled so this was quite troublesome, but now was not the time to complain about that.

Every time a part of my body disappeared, my body would be reorganized with 'Infinite Regeneration'. By doing so, I was forcibly taking in the energy that I had eaten. It would have been much easier to discard it, but that was not possible. If I didn't 'Analyze and Assess' the magicules properly, I might damage Veldora's *heart*.

It was very troublesome, but this was the best process. This conclusion was made after consulting with Ciel, so all that remained was to repeat the whole process.

I abandoned my thoughts and continued working.

Time was running out, but the target was huge. I was worried that I might not be able to finish in time, but I believed in Ciel. We would make it in time.

![break]

<<Since I was free, I've been doing some analysis work in my spare time, would you like to hear about it?>>

![break]

<...>

Just now, what do you mean that you were free?

What have you been doing while I've been in pain?

![break]

<<What I was doing was the 'Analyze and Assess' of Velgrynd's abilities. I studied the 'Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration' isolated in the 'Imaginary Space' and figured out its laws.>>

![break]

No, no, no, I wasn't asking a question---huh, you figured it out?!

![break]

<<Although I failed to recreate the power, it is possible to develop a similar technique.>>

![break]

That's ridiculous, Ciel. Those were from the surface of my thoughts, but I suppose I should assume it was always being read. Let's be mindful of the mental boundary and think about stuff on the deeper level of my mind.

Anyway, it's amazing that it can copy Velgrynd's sure-kill technique. An Ultimate Skill should be impossible to reproduce just by looking at it...

*No, wait? What else were you analyzing?*

I got scared and decided to ask it outright, <What else did you analyze?>

Then, Ciel replied as if it had been waiting for me a long time.

![break]

<<Yes! The analysis of 'Storm Blast' has also been completed. It is possible to use the ability by using the remainder of 'Storm King Veldora'.>>

![break]

Wait, wait! The pain I'm feeling right now was blown away by the seriousness of this report! It's hard to believe that you could complete such a difficult degree of analysis in your spare time...

![break]

<<No, it's true. And these are not important, the main point is what follows!>>

![break]

I unconsciously reacted on the surface level of my mind.

But that's fine. There was no point in hiding it anyway. I mean, it made sense when I thought about it. I did have the Ultimate Skill 'Storm King Veldora' left. If I used it, it wouldn't be surprising if I could recreate the 'Storm Blast'. It was awesome to be able to use a powerful ability, and to be honest, I was happy. That's why I was surprised, but it didn't seem strange to Ciel. Thinking about it that way, I was more concerned about what Ciel actually thought was important.

<What is the main point?>

![break]

<<Regarding the 'Predated' energy of the Storm Dragon earlier, I have successfully analyzed it. It is now possible to transform the body composition of my lord into the same species as "True Dragon" Veldora. Do you wish to proceed?>>

![break]

What? Just now, didn't you just casually say something very disturbing? Transforming my body composition into the same kind as Veldora's?

Do I wish to proceed? What the hell!

I'm a little confused. If my understanding is correct, that would mean I would become a True Dragon...?

![break]

<<That understanding is correct.>>

![break]

Huuuh?! Correct---you say?!

...Are you for real?

![break]

<<Of course! So, do you wish to evolve into a True Dragon? YES/NO.>>

![break]

Fufufu... Fuhaha... FUHAHAHAHA!!

I couldn't help but perform the three-stage laugh.

At a time like this, it still has to ask YES or NO---while thinking of such a trivial thing, I gave the command.

![break]

YES!

![break]

In an instant, the agony I'd been feeling vanished. Including pain, heat, and suffering. The new me was immune to the Storm Dragon's 'Dragon Spirit Haki'. It was because I could now use 'Dragon Spirit Haki' as well.

In other words, the more I ate, the more energy I would gain. My magicule count was increasing rapidly. The rate of increase was so high that I was worried that it would expand beyond control and run rampant.

![break]

<<No problem. I will manage it perfectly.>>

![break]

I'm sure you will.

With Ciel, there was no need to worry about that. Now that I was a True Dragon, my magicule count was finally in line with Veldora's. And I would break through the limit. Here I am, reborn as a new 'True Dragon.'

![break]

At the time when this situation was left unattended, there was a fatal delay in the response of the Storm Dragon.

<You have won, Rimuru. I'm surprised that you've become a True Dragon, but I guess I was right about you all along. Kuahahaha!!>

Veldora boasted of victory, not really sounding surprised.

'I raised you'---he seemed to say, but it goes without saying that Veldora-san was not useful. Besides, it was too early to feel victorious. What was important was Veldora's *heart*, and its whereabouts were still unknown.

That's why I decided to put on the finishing touches.

"Now then, let's finish this!"

I can't allow you to call yourself my favorite "Storm Dragon."

"Devour all, 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth!'!!"

In obedience to my command, the 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' devoured the 'Storm Dragon.' With pleasure. And with tremendous speed. Unlike before, the progression was one-sided. The devourer and the devoured. It was as if to embody "the weak are meat the strong eat"...

![break]

The curtain had fallen quietly on the epic battle without a sound. An evolution and a new birth had occurred, leading to a further destination. The residue of the leaked energy filled the surrounding area with a light so bright that was difficult to see. It was like the light of blessing. A light celebrating the birth of a new "type." It was the light emitted by my old body, which had not transformed into a "True Dragon," as it was converted into pure energy.

Even this residue became my food and disappeared.

And just like that, I achieved my goal in flawless form.


![hard scene break]


When the light subsided, there was only one unidentified life form remaining. Veldora was gone. The slime---Demon Lord Rimuru---had eaten him, Velgrynd realized.

.........

......

...

According to the investigation, Rimuru had been born from the magicule pool that leaked from Veldora. And yet, Rimuru devoured all of the Storm Dragon, his parent, and transformed himself into the fifth True Dragon---Ultimate Slime.

Immediately after, the slime began to take human form. He had a single sword in his hand and not a scrap of clothing. He looked around 15 to 16 years old. At a height of only 160 centimeters or so, it was not an exaggeration to say that he was of small stature.

However, the amount of magicule contained within him was not only comparable to Veldora's, but it also surpassed it.

His golden eyes were large and beautiful, as if they could see through everything. His silvery hair was lightly tinged with light blue, giving off a moonlit glow. He had no gender, and his face was more dainty than beautiful. However, the divine presence that he gave off was sublimely transformed into beauty. His dazzling white skin was cloaked in an aura of black and gold.

Then, Rimuru seemed to whisper something in displeasure, and the aura that covered his body transformed into divine jet-black, full-body garments. With 'Matter Creation,' a specialty of the demons, he had materialized the garments. Even with the magicules leaking from his body were used, there was no telling how strong the armor was.

Rimuru perfectly suppressed his excess energy in an instant. Then he grinned in satisfaction.

![break]

Velgrynd witnessed all of this from inside her prison. The transfer of energy had also been interrupted. She was completely stunned, unable to believe what she was seeing.

The battle between her brother, the Storm Dragon Veldora, and the demon lord Rimuru, should have been overwhelmingly in Veldora's favor. There was absolutely no way that Veldora could lose.

If that were possible, then they would have had to be equals from the start...

*A coincidence? It can't be...was that slime really just born there by chance?!*

Sinking into a sea of thoughts, Velgrynd arrived at the astonishing conclusion. However, she could not admit it so easily. It was only natural. A monster being born in the vicinity of a True Dragon with a 'soul' that could adapt to the Dragon Factor---there was no way that could happen by chance.

If he were indeed the fifth True Dragon, he could be considered a younger brother. However, Rimuru ate Veldora and evolved into a True Dragon. Velgrynd could not accept that such a being could be called a True Dragon. He was something similar to a True Dragon, so to speak. She could not and would not accept such a horrible existence. He needed to be exterminated here and now---Velgrynd's instincts told her so. That would be the only way to avenge her younger brother.

To Velgrynd, Veldora was her cute little brother. He was cocky, rambunctious, and very difficult to deal with, but she envied his freedom. She had intended to use him as a pawn, but that was only a few years in the long life of a dragon. She had no intention of wiping him out, and she had intended to release him once she was done.

And yet...

.........

......

...

The moment Velgrynd realized that Veldora had been devoured before her eyes, she felt her sanity blown away by anger.

"How dare you...devour my cute little brother!!" Velgrynd roared in anger.

Two hundred seconds had passed, and the 'Insulation Prison' shattered. The Scorch Dragon, now without reason and without regard for her own self-preservation, unleashed her hostility towards Rimuru.


![hard scene break]


It seems that I've been reborn as a new species after eating Veldora. The species seems to be called 'Ultimate Slime,' but with this, I am now a member of the True Dragon race---although, it's a subspecies. I guess I'm not related to slimes anymore, but I kept that thought a secret.

It's already done now, so no point in thinking about it.

![break]

I checked my new body. The main body that could be created without consuming magicules had grown considerably. Or rather, should I say I had grown up? Now I was about as tall as a high school student. A girl, though... Actually, that didn't really mean much because my apparent age could be changed as I liked. I just thought it was interesting to see myself grow up like this.

The important thing was whether I could relax and work or not. The volume of my slime form also increased, and it seemed to be around 70 to 80 centimeters in diameter. This was too big to be held, so I wanted to keep it small somehow. I'd check on that later.

And, there was a problem. I wasn't wearing anything at the moment. In other words, I was naked. That was not good. Although my weird youki was leaking out and hiding my body, it still was ethically unpleasant for me.

That's why I made some clothes. I tried the 'Matter Creation', which Diablo had taught me, and it worked surprisingly easily. I was told that the performance of the garment would be quite good, depending on the ability of the maker. It was very comfortable to wear, and the jet-black clothes looked cool.

As for the grade I was curious about... It was mythical-grade.

Wah? Mythical-grade? Mythical-grade, huh? I see---wait, what?!

To be completely amazed was exactly how I felt at the moment. It truly felt like I had evolved, but I see. Perhaps, my current power was even greater than I had imagined. Thinking about it, there were a few things that came to mind.

Benimaru and the others had evolved into awakened demon lords, and their power was returned to me by the 'Food Chain', so that was probably one of the reasons. Another reason might be that I ate Veldora and took in his power. It was also certain that the unusable energy that had been stored in my 'Stomach' had been analyzed and made usable.

For these various reasons, I felt like they all came together and blossomed all at once. This was the result of everything working well together. In short, it was all thanks to Ciel. No, it would be rude to drop the honorifics here. Out of respect for my partner, I shall call you Ciel-sensei!

![break]

<<Please stop.>>

![break]

I heard that, but I didn't care. Really, sensei was brilliant.

I'll be relying on you from now on!

![break]

<<Leave it to me!>>

![break]

Hmhmm.

Now that I was dressed, I wouldn't forget my goal.

<Veldora, are you okay?>

<Kuahahaha! Of course, don't make me repeat myself. More importantly, I'm amazed that you successfully managed to defeat my body!>

<Well, yeah. Looking back on it, I lost control a little. But still, I'm relieved. Really!>

Veldora and I rejoiced in each other's safety.

Since we were able to converse like this, it appeared that Veldora's *heart* was safe. Now all that was left was to connect the Soul Corridor and restore the Ultimate Skill 'Storm King Veldora'.

![break]

<<Successful without any problems.>>

![break]

That's my Ciel-sensei. Even if I don't say anything, it's always working for me. It was a perfect job this time as well.

All right. I had accomplished my goal. Now that Veldora was back, I had no business with the Imperial Army. However, my anger was still alive and well, and I intended to take it out on Emperor Rudra. Besides, ending the war half-heartedly would lead to future disasters. Now that we had come this far, we had to be thorough. It was my duty as a king to eliminate the threat.

Now that my anger had subsided, I was beginning to think that it was okay to leave all but Rudra alone, but I would do my job to the end without being distracted. Besides, even if I were willing to give in, there would be times when my enemies wouldn't keep silent.

As proof of this---I saw Velgrynd still alive and well, staring daggers at me from her prison cell.

I succeeded in freeing Veldora, but for some reason Velgrynd had become furious. There was no point in trying to defeat her, so I couldn't be bothered to deal with her, but...

The threat had to be eliminated.

![break]

<<Velgrynd is no longer a threat. Although the analysis of all her powers is not yet complete, the countermeasures are perfect.>>

![break]

Ciel-sensei's confidence was amazing. Or was it pride?

![break]

<<No, it is a hard fact.>>

![break]

It would be ridiculous if we lost, but I guess we wouldn't have to worry about that. Even in the previous fight it had completely blocked Velgrynd's attacks. The current Ciel should be able to subdue her without much trouble.

Well, there was no change in our plan of taking this opportunity to hit the Empire thoroughly. I intended to finish them off right here, without leaving even a single drop of blood. As of now, the Black Numbers were on the rampage. There were several large whirlpools in the battlefield, and it appeared that there were no significant players left. If I was aiming for Rudra, I would collide with her anyway, so it was tactically correct to deal a blow to Velgrynd here.

The Empire had Lieutenant Kondou and Damrada. The four knights guarding Rudra were also very troublesome opponents. Yuuki was also being controlled by Rudra and had to be dealt with as an enemy. In addition, there should be one more Single Digit left. I didn't know what he or she looked like, but since this soldier was likely at the 'Saint' level, we needed to be careful. In other words, even if we exclude Rudra and Velgrynd, there were still eight strong enemies left.

Judging by the signs on the battlefield, it seemed that there were a few others who could be considered "threats," so I would deal with them all right now.

To be perfectly honest, even those powerful people didn't feel like much of a threat to me right now. This was because the amount of magicules in me had increased nearly tenfold since I had evolved into a True Dragon. As a result, the quality and quantity of my powers had been greatly enhanced, and I felt that I was much stronger than before.

Since I hadn't released Veldora yet, I was at full energy. I was in great shape, and I felt like I could give Milim and Guy a run for their money.

---No, I shouldn't be too conceited. If I get carried away like that, I will surely fail. Let's just keep our guard up and act with caution.

By the way, while looking for signs of warfare, I noticed that the powerful opponents I had just mentioned were already engaged with Benimaru and the others. I was the one who had given the order, but I was still impressed by their quick actions. At the same time, I was worried about the possible casualties.

Were they obeying my orders not to die?

I hoped that they didn't act recklessly just to keep everyone out of my way...

Well, I could worry about that later. Right before me was Velgrynd, who looked like she was about to jump me. I would deal with her first, and then decide whether or not to go help them.

![break]

In less than a second, I made that decision. Then, the next question was how to fight her.

First, how about using the 'Storm Dragon Release' of the Ultimate Skill 'Storm King Veldora'? With this, I could summon Veldora and take on Velgrynd in a two-on-one battle. That way, victory would be assured.

Come to think of it, it seems that my magicule capacity was not always full. It was probably because I had been letting Veldora run free. Veldora and I were like one and the same, and if one of us was safe, we could revive each other without any problem. It was different from Velgrynd's 'Parallel Existence', but that cheat-like invincibility was noteworthy.

If I thought about that as the price to pay, the magicule burden was not a problem. Besides, the surplus of magicules from Veldora was flowing into me, so I did not feel inconvenienced that much. In fact, the circulatory effect had revitalized my body.

That's why, although the 'Storm Dragon Release' had some disadvantages, the advantages were far greater. It used to consume about 90 percent of my magicules, but now the burden appeared to be about 30 percent.

With that in mind, I attempted to activate the 'Storm Dragon Release'.

"How dare you... My cute little brother!!" Velgrynd shouted.

From my perspective, this was a misplaced anger.

"Aren't you the one who struck first?! You guys were the ones who tried to get me to fight Veldora in the first place!"

"Shut up! Veldora couldn't have been eaten by someone like you!! Although he wasn't all great, I never thought he could fall behind a demon lord... I will never accept that he disappeared because of this. I will never forgive you."

The enraged Velgrynd recklessly unleashed a heat ray (Blaster) at me.

Unfortunately, it didn't work on me. But, well, this is what I learned from that conversation. I thought she was angry, but it was because I had eaten Veldora. She thought I had killed him and wiped him out completely. In that case, the answer is simple. 'Storm Dragon Release' will clear up all the misunderstanding. And yet:

<Gawawawah! W-wait, Rimuru!> Veldora, the person in question, stopped me.

<What's the matter?> I asked, worried...

<Listen, Rimuru. My sister is furious right now because she thinks I'm gone. Is that right?>

<Yeah, she is. So why don't you come out and explain, and maybe we can avoid unnecessary conflict?>

<You idiot! Don't be crazy!! Showing that I'm safe with that kind of timing will be too awkward. All of my sister's anger might turn to me!!>

What a stupid answer. I felt like I'd lost after listening to it seriously.

I was so shocked I thought I would stop breathing. When I heard Veldora saying that, I realized that I could not rely on him at all. But really...this person was useless at every critical moment, wasn't he? I felt like an idiot and was about to complain, but at that moment, Ciel also stopped me.

![break]

<<Please wait. In any case, this is an opportunity to optimize Veldora's powers. I have his permission, so please wait to execute 'Storm Dragon Release' until after his Skill has been innovated.>>

![break]

The tone was as clean and polite as ever.

Ciel said that it would innovate Veldora's Ultimate Skill 'Investigation King Faust' to evolve into the Ultimate Skill 'Chaos King Nyarlathotep'. Since it was an "evolution", it appeared that it would be terribly enhanced.

What caught my attention was the statement that permission had been given by the person himself. To my surprise, Ciel's existence was known to Veldora.

<Since when?>

![break]

<<He was already aware of my existence just after Rimuru-sama evolved into a demon lord.>>

![break]

That's what Ciel-san said.

<I was aware, but I only became certain of it a short while ago. In the first place, I've never heard of a mere Skill developing an ego in all of history. However, the power of the deadly sins system seemed to have something like an ego, so I began to wonder if it was possible.>

According to Veldora, he had suspected something since the time of the Great Sage. He said he had been observing things from inside my Stomach, and there had been a lot of strange phenomena from time to time.

After the Great Sage became the 'Wisdom King Raphael' due to my demon lord evolution, he felt that his suspicions were almost certain. He said that he had been talking with it before that, but he had thought that it was me he was talking to. Not that it bothered me, but I was curious about what kind of conversations they had.

In any case, Veldora was acquainted with Ciel. That's what was important.

<In other words, you two knew each other. And you agreed to Ciel's proposal, is that correct?>

<Yes, that's right! As much as I would love to deal with my sister, I cannot do so because of these circumstances. Sorry Rimuru, but I'll leave it to you!>

Hey, you're exploiting the situation. That's not what you were saying earlier!

I could have shouted at him, but I still felt sorry for him, so I stopped. Ciel also seemed like it wanted to play with Veldora's Skill. Even though I thought there was no need to do it now, it might be more troublesome to do after he was released.

Besides, I also wanted to test my own strength. I thought it was necessary to know how strong I was if I had to deal with Rudra after this. Velgrynd would be just the right opponent. The current me could fight with a bit of leeway, so I would be able to see how much I had grown in various ways.

It was time. I would keep an eye on my friends, but until they were in danger, I would prioritize testing my Skills.

![break]

<<That's a good idea.>>

![break]

Ciel seemed very happy, somehow.

I was motivated to fight with that in mind, but it also suggested something to me as a side note.

![break]

<<By the way, as a result of various analyses, it is possible to combine the Ultimate Skill 'Storm King Veldora' and 'Covenant King Uriel' to create the Ultimate Skill 'Stellar Wind King Hastur'. Should it be implemented?>>

![break]

Ciel-sensei, you don't seem to have the slightest intention of restraining yourself... Just how much room do you think I have to spare when I'm about to fight Velgrynd right now?

'I have no interest in Velgrynd anymore'---it was practically saying that out loud.

It seems to enjoy modifying Skills as a hobby, but I would have preferred to do that in times of peace.

For the time being, it is rejected.

<You might be able to find a better way to improve it, right? So be careful for now and think about it slowly later!>

![break]

<<!! As expected of Master. Understood. I will continue my search for greater heights.>>

![break]

Mm-hmm. I'm glad to hear it's convinced.

I didn't quite know what it meant by "as expected of Master", but at least now I could concentrate on fighting. The 'Covenant King Uriel' was effective against Velgrynd. There was no way I was going to give up that advantage here, no matter how much I had the upper hand.

Of course, I probably could have won with only the 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth,' But this was not a game, and I couldn't let my guard down. Even in an unlikely event, there was no room for failure.

I understood that Ciel thought very highly of me, so I would just ignore its flattery. Still, Ciel's enthusiasm for modding Skills was disturbing. Veldora was its current victim, but that was okay because he wanted it too. The problem, however, was what would happen after this battle was over.

I had a feeling that my friends who had awakened as demon lords would have to undergo some major Skill modifications as well. Ciel-sensei would probably be able to strengthen them as well. I had a feeling that it was waiting vigilantly for an opportunity to do so.

Perhaps it had already...

As I was thinking about this, the time to settle the score with Velgrynd had arrived.


![soft scene break]


The crimson flying dragon and I stared at each other in the sky. As soon as Velgrynd changed into her human form, the battle began instantly.

While firing a series of Nuclear Cannons at me, she slashed at me with her 'Blue Dragon Sword'.^[Seiryuu-katana = Blue Dragon Katana/Sword.]

So, what was the difference between human form and Dragon Mode? To put it simply, it came down to the difference in defense power. The attack power was exactly the same. The energy efficiency of the human form was far superior. Since the ability to continue the battle would increase accordingly, it could be said that the human form was more suitable for long-term battles.

However, the Dragon Mode also had a considerable advantage. That was the fact that it was massive in size. The scale of the attack increased with the size of the body. The power would remain the same, but the range of the attack increased. This meant that the dragon form would be able to take on multiple enemies at the same time. It went without saying that even if the enemy was a single person, it would be difficult to evade all attacks unleashed from a large body.

And then there was the defensive aspect. This was its true value. To kill a massive body, one needed a large-scale attack to match it. That was difficult to defeat with a sword, and even most magic was useless in terms of that scale. To begin with, there were few spells that could even be used against a True Dragon, but even if that was ignored, there was still no point in using single-target spells. Only a spell with a wide enough range could do much damage.

That's why, if anything, the Dragon Mode was stronger...however, Velgrynd had chosen to take her human form. Her intentions were probably to---

![break]

<<It is presumed that she has abandoned her defenses to take down Master with certainty.>>

![break]

That's about what it seemed like.

If that was the case, I would fight with that assumption as well. The murderous expression on Velgrynd's face enhanced her beauty. That murderous aura was imbued in her blade as she swung it down with a force that could cut me in half.

Naturally, I didn't intend to take it lying down. Leaving Ciel to deal with the magic, I intercepted Velgrynd with my favorite sword---the hihiirokane straight sword.

Velgrynd's Blue Dragon Sword was a type of broadsword. She was not hiding it before, but it was a weapon that Velgrynd had created with 'Matter Creation'. Its grade was comparable to mythical-grade.

My sword, on the other hand, had reached mythical-grade, perhaps in sync with my becoming a True Dragon. Velgrynd's Blue Dragon Sword was a threat, but my weapon would not be defeated either.

On the contrary:

*Chiiing.*

*W*ith a high-pitched sound, Velgrynd's Blue Dragon Sword snapped and shattered. I was surprised, but Velgrynd must have been even more so.

"What did you do?" she demanded, after leaping away.

I hadn't meant to do anything; I was simply taking the attack. That's why I didn't know what I did either.

![break]

<<It was the difference in weapon performance. While Master's straight sword is a masterpiece forged by Kurobee with all his heart and soul, Velgrynd's Blue Dragon Sword is a mass-produced product simply made of condensed magicules. The density of the magicules is so great that it is equivalent to a mythical-grade sword, but it is essentially a dull sword by nature.>>

![break]

Is that so?

I knew there were varying levels of quality within the same grade, but I didn't think that there would be this much difference within the mythical-grade. Sure enough, it was one's familiar equipment that could be relied upon. I was glad to find out about this. After all, even my clothes had been created by 'Matter Creation.'

It was safer not to expect too much from something just because it was mythical-grade.

"It just became clear to me now, but there seems to be a world of difference in performance between even the same grade levels. The weapons you create are no match for my sword."

I didn't think she'd give up now, but I still told her.

Velgrynd was by no means a fool, so she seemed to see that I was not lying. However, she still seemed unconvinced, as several times after that, she produced her Blue Dragon Sword and slashed at me. I smashed through all of them. Finally, Velgrynd seemed to have accepted the reality. She glared at me in frustration and immediately moved on to her next attack. If her manifested weapons were no good, then she would have to rely on her own body. Velgrynd's claws extended, and she took a stance similar to that in Chinese martial arts.

Seeing that, I put my sword away.

"...What are you doing?"

An experiment, of course. I wanted to see how much I'd grown, so I stopped relying on my sword.

"Using a weapon would feel like I was bullying a weakling, so I'll take you on with my bare hands."

What's a fight without a little trash talk? If I could make her lose her composure, then it wouldn't be too much to say that the victory was won at that point.

"Don't make a fool of me!!"

It worked. It was almost funny how easily Velgrynd fell into my trap. All I had to do now was play my cards right to seal the deal^[The Japanese term used here was "tsume shōgi" which is a miniature shogi problem where the only goal is to achieve the final checkmate. Unlike in chess where there are stalemates, shogi does not do this, and "tsume shōgi" problems are strictly forced checkmate problems.].

Velgrynd's claw attacks were fast. It was impossible to follow them with your eyes. But my current perception speed was extraordinary. Since the name "Ciel" was given to Wisdom King Raphael-san, my 'Thought Acceleration' had been increasing. It had been a million times faster than normal, but now it was several hundred million times faster.

Surprisingly, even the speed of light could be recognized. That said, even if I could recognize it, it did not mean that I could move at that speed. That must not be misunderstood.

However, that wasn't to say that there were no ways around it. In addition to the activation of magic, the activation of 'Spatial Transportation' had become almost a thousand times faster. In other words, if the distance between me and the attacker was a certain distance, it was now possible to escape from a light-speed attack with 'transport'.

A second was stretched out to over a decade, and it felt like seeing the world at a complete stand still. The inability to move for such a long time could not have been endured by a normal person's ego, but Ciel had smoothly solved this problem by activating 'Thought Acceleration' during the key points.

It didn't matter to me how fast Velgrynd could move. At this point, I didn't need any swordplay or physical skills, and could push through with brute force alone. Velgrynd's superspeed attack was approaching. Its speed was several hundred times the speed of sound, and the old me would have had a hard time with it.

Now, however, it was no problem.

"Too slow."

While provoking Velgrynd with that, I 'Transported' behind her. However, Velgrynd was no slouch. Perhaps she had anticipated my actions, and she reacted immediately.

To be honest, I thought she was tough. After all, one couldn't be too careful against one of the strongest.

"I knew it. I didn't think you could move faster than me, so you were using 'Spatial Transportation'. It's amazing that you can transport so naturally without distorting space, but it can be dealt with if I know the source."

I thought she would be furious at my provocation, but she was much calmer than I expected.

As expected of Veldora-san's sister... This was also as Ciel had expected.

Velgrynd's next move would be to---

"If I interfere with the space and lock it, you will not be able to transport in my area of control. That's too bad."

After all, that was the only thing she could do.

Naturally, Velgrynd also possessed 'Spatial Domination' and was able to interfere with a wide area of space around herself. If Velgrynd did this, I would not be able to use 'Spatial Domination' to transport.

It wasn't entirely impossible if I forced myself, but it would be useless if the location were exposed. It could also be used to escape, but since the destination of escape would be revealed, it would be meaningless in the end.

Once the transportation Skills were blocked like this, physical speed would determine the battle. For Velgrynd, this created a winning environment.

That's why her next move would be---

"I never thought I'd have to use my trump card against someone like you."

"You think you've won just by blocking transportation? If so, I'll have to show you that you're wrong."

"You really *are* cocky. If it wasn't for that kid's revenge, I wouldn't have hated you. But this is it."

Velgrynd took her stance.

She kicked off the air, turning herself into a bullet at supersonic speed.

The speed increased even further---

"Scorch Dragon 'Cardinal Acceleration'!!"

The voice echoed across the future.

Velgrynd herself became a crimson meteor, closing in on me at the physical speed limit of sub-light speed. Moreover, the meteor bullet could change its orbit.

By transforming her own body into a meteor bullet, Velgrynd had achieved the ability to change her trajectory at will. Or rather, this was the true nature of the Scorch Dragon 'Cardinal Acceleration'. Not simply a straight-line attack, but a tracking attack with the ability to shift directions freely. It was the ultimate destructive attack, possessing not only energy waves but also mass.

Ciel-sensei had analyzed the Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration and had perfectly seen through its essence.

Velgrynd was terrifying, but Ciel-sensei was even more terrifying.

The fact that I had created a Manas named Ciel on a whim would be the cause of Velgrynd's defeat.

![break]

<<As planned, the 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' is deployed all around Master. No matter the direction of contact, there will be no problem with Velgrynd's 'Predation'.>>

![break]

That's exactly what it said.

Even if I tried to eat the target normally, the resistance of a willful being was a lot. On top of that, I was dealing with a True Dragon. No matter how hard Ciel tried, 'Predation' with the 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' was impossible.

But even so...

Velgrynd, of her own volition, turned her body into a meteor bullet. By putting all of her energy into attacking, she had greatly reduced her resistance.

This was the result of that.

Velgrynd was now isolated in my 'Imaginary Space'.

<How is this possible?! Why, what just happened?>

The moment she thought she had finished me off, she was suddenly sent into an empty space. It would be difficult for Velgrynd to grasp the current situation. It would take her a while to realize that she had lost. That's why I would tell her directly.

<I've won. You just stay where you are.>

<...I, I-I've lost?>

<That's right. You won't be able to escape my 'Imaginary Space', and I don't think it's possible for you to transfer energy even with your 'Parallel Existence.>

As for the amount of Velgrynd's magicules I had eaten, Ciel-sensei said it was more than 50 percent. The 'Split Body' on Rudra's side was at about 20 percent, and the remaining 30 percent or so was being restored. It seems that her body could only recover about 10 percent a day, so it should be possible to get back to 50 percent in about three days.

However, because I still had the 'Split Body' inside me, I didn't think she'd be able to recover that much. It was complicated because her ego existed on both sides, but there was no doubt that Velgrynd had been weakened.

<Just ask Veldora for the details.>

<Ask Veldora? What are you talking about...>

Velgrynd looked confused, but it would be quicker to hear it from his own mouth than from me.

<Kuahahaha! Sister, it's me. You seem to be in a not-so-good mood.>

<Veldora?! You, didn't you disappear?!>

Next, I would let the siblings talk things over and settle down in a calm environment.

And just like that, I had won a complete victory over Velgrynd, and succeeded in capturing most of her magicules in the 'Imaginary Space'.

Thus, with the birth of my reliable partner Ciel, the reckless challenge of taking on two "True Dragons" at the same time ended more perfectly than ever.
