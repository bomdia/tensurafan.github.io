# Afterword

I'm happy to announce the release of volume 15.

Last time, I overshot the deadline, and I may or may not remember saying that I would be careful, but unfortunately, I overshot the deadline by about ten days this time, too. I will reflect more on this point and be a little more careful next time!

In fact, I had discussed this with I-San early on.

*"It might be a little tough."*

*"Let's go for it!"*

*"You can't continue, right?"*

*"The last issue was dragging on, so I'd like to finish it this time."*

*"That's right, but the number of pages is..."*

*"It's okay! I don't care how many pages it's going to be!"*

![break]

That's not what I meant though! I was rushing inwardly at the time. This volume has the largest number of characters in the series, and some of them are new to the series. I know that I'm ignoring the theory, but I've decided that it can't be helped. And just like that, the number of sentences for each scene increased rapidly.

That's why the amount of text was getting larger and larger as I wrote each scene. I wanted to break the story in the middle and continue to the next volume...but that was rejected.

![break]

*"All right, then. If that's the case, please consider extending the release by a month."*

*"Hmm...let's do our best until the very last minute!"*

![break]

And so the time went by without either of us giving up...

I, too, gave up and kept on writing, until I had already written more than volume 14.

![break]

*"How's it going?"*

*"Well, it's still tough. I'll probably go over by about ten days at this rate."*

*"I understand. Then I've made up my mind."*

*"Oh, so you're saying the release date is in October?"*

*"No. We can manage to go over by ten days, so we'll go for a September release!"*

![break]

I honestly thought, *'Seriously?'*

*You've made up your mind in that direction?*

There was no guarantee that it would only take ten days, but I-san's determination remained unchanged.

![break]

*"I think the number of pages will be the largest ever..."*

*"Don't worry about that, just try to meet the deadline!"*

*"I...okay."*

![break]

And so, I was overwhelmed, and somehow managed to meet the deadline.

And as a result, this work became the largest amount of text ever written.

The content has diverged so much from the web that it's no longer an exaggeration to say that it's something else. I'm thinking about the contents of the next volume now, so please look forward to it!

I would like to express my greatest gratitude to everyone who has supported and worked on *That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime*.

I hope to see you again in the next volume!
