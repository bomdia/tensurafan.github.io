# Chapter 1: Time of Despair

Just as Rimuru was preparing to infiltrate the Imperial City, Dwarf King Gazel Dwargo found himself at the center of a desperate battlefield. He was unable to avert his gaze from the incarnation of beauty scattering death in the distance.

"Was that 'Gravity Collapse'? It can theoretically expand its power infinitely. Do you think legion magic can prevent it?" Gazel asked the assembled group.

"That's absurd. It's impossible to prevent it, even if you place both the magic support team and the magic strike team on the defense. A True Dragon is not a danger that can be quantified," answered Admiral Paladin Vaughn.

Vaughn, along with the dwarf army deployed to the area, had been waiting for Gazel's arrival. As such, he had a front row seat to the destruction of the Empire's Mixed Corps.

All the soldiers were shocked speechless by the scale of the tragedy. Their will to fight was crushed, yet they did not flee. Everyone understood that retreat here meant the death of their family and friends back home. If their death could help those precious loved ones survive for even a little while longer, that alone justified their sacrifice. That thought kept their feet planted in their orderly ranks. King Gazel, a champion, would not squander their lives in vain. That is what the soldiers believed, and from that belief sprang their deep loyalty to him.

Although Gazel fully understood and accepted the feelings of the soldiers, Gazel was in agony. Although he remained calm on the surface, his mind was in turmoil.

*We can't win, and this futile battle will end up wasting everyone's lives. Should I surrender? The Empire will not allow it. We must show them at least some of our power...*

They had to convince the Empire that it was better to take them in than to fight them. Otherwise, the Empire would not even accept their submission. In that case, the only way to survive was to fight them tooth and nail. No matter how many sacrifices had to be made, they had to believe that they would not die in vain.

"They say quality is better than quantity, but this feels like cheating. We'll have to take her on all by ourselves and defeat her."

"Hey now, isn't the king supposed to command the whole army?"

"Fool, there is only one enemy. Under the circumstances, what use is there in commanding the whole army?"

Gazel laughed at Vaughn's question. There was only one enemy---Velgrynd. Strategy and tactics were meaningless against her, and Gazel and the others had no choice but to find a way to survive. Vaughn, well aware of this, asked his question facetiously to ease Gazel's mind. And it helped, as Gazel felt his anxiety diminish.

Anrietta then reported to Gazel, "My king, it seems that the Scorch Dragon is not the only enemy. There are a number of people behind her, and they seem to be performing some sort of ritual. Jaine-sama says that the supreme magic may be part of that ritual..."

Gazel nodded in response.

The supreme magic that had sacrificed sixty thousand troops was being used in some kind of ritual. Gazel could tell straight away that there was an evil plot afoot, the details of which he didn't wish to imagine. Even so, it would be extremely difficult to defeat Velgrynd, who was at the center of the plot. In that case, the only path forward was to defeat those behind her.

"Do you want to move the troops?" Dolph asked, but Gazel shook his head.

The heavily-armed strike force was not very mobile and would become a target for magic if they were not moved thoughtfully. Normally, they would use their strong defenses as a shield to push forward, but that would be pointless against Velgrynd. A suicide attack with five hundred Pegasus Knights would be their only option...

"I don't like the idea of weakening the defense here. Gazel's right. We'll just have to go in alone. Right, Dolph?" Vaughn spoke with a laugh.

Dolph, on the other hand, scratched his head and responded earnestly, "That's disrespectful, Vaughn. It's beyond outrageous to call the king by his name! You need to consider your position..."

Dolph lectured for a moment before agreeing with a smile, as if he had suddenly set aside his gripe.

"But this time, you've got a point. If we want to buy as much time as possible, we should avoid dispersing our forces. Besides, if it's just us, we'll be agile and might be able to take the enemy by surprise."

"Jaine-sama also said she would join the war once she has persuaded the elders," Anrietta added in agreement. "Let's just leave all those worries to her, and we can go wild like in the old days!"

They waited for Gazel's reply with bated breath. These old friends had not changed at all. They were united with Gazel and stood by him to help him tackle this impossible situation.

Gazel laughed, "Fufu! What a bunch of fools! I wonder what Jaine, our chaperone, would say if she heard..."

For a long time, Jaine had been accompanying Gazel and his crew, giving them candid advice and suggestions. She was the most powerful wizard in the Dwarven Kingdom, and Gazel's trusted advisor.

*Jaine would be very angry, I suppose.*

With that in mind, Gazel was about to make his decision. But it seemed to be a little too late.

"Oh dear. This is what happens when I take my eyes off of you for even a second. You're such a trouble-maker, King Gazel."

Just before Gazel and the others set out, Jaine arrived via transfer magic.

"Jaine. Did you hear everything?"

Jaine stole a sideways glance at an embarrassed-looking Gazel and shook her head.

"I thought that you had become a magnificent king and was relieved. However, I can't blame you this time. With an opponent like her, there is nothing we can do. The reason that a True Dragon is Catastrophe-class is because it is impossible for a nation to deal with."

"Well, that's true."

The True Dragons could not be touched by the kind of magic humans normally used. In fact, the spell that Velgrynd was currently wielding was far too powerful for human beings to manage. Even if all the champions of the human race were to unite, it was unknown whether or not they would be able to defeat a True Dragon. But that did not mean that there was no hope.

"I just received notice," Jaine said.

"Hmm?"

"His Majesty Rimuru is sending reinforcements. Let's take action once they arrive."

And there was hope, right on time.

"How is that possible? Barely any time has passed since I contacted you!"

"Well, I'm having a hard time understanding it myself, but I'm not lying. Vesta-dono reported to me, and we all know that His Majesty Rimuru can mobilize all the people of that country with just a word..."

All those gathered could only nod their heads in exasperation as they listened to Jaine's dumbfounding words.

That's right, everyone understood right away. And before they could even change gears, reliable reinforcements had arrived.


![soft scene break]


Suddenly, there was a distortion in space. As if enveloped in a giant cocoon, a small army of elite soldiers emerged. There were one hundred of the Hiryuu led by Gabil, and three hundred of the Kurenai under the command of Gobua. Four hundred in total---each at least A rank---a fighting group that could rival the Pegasus Knights.

And what's more, there was a huge weapon that demanded everyone's attention.

"I had heard that it was perfected, but I did not expect them to pull out all the stops and use it here. That's Rimuru for you."

"Is that the finished form of the magic armored soldier?"

"That's right. It seems that it was named the 'Demon Colossus.' It's a reliable ally to have on your side."

Gazel certainly understood that it would be no match for Velgrynd, however, its majestic appearance could put the soldiers at ease by its presence alone.

"How reliable. If we could have mass-produced them, we might have been able to fight a little better."

"Unfortunately, they would be useless against Velgrynd. It might be able to handle a Disaster-class, though."

As Gazel and the others were having their conversation, some newcomers approached them. It was Gabil, the legion leader, and the three demon girls, led by Testarossa. They were followed by Gobua and Hakurou.

"It has been a long time, King Gazel."

For some reason, it was Testarossa who greeted them instead of Gabil. She was the right person for this situation. Testarossa had diplomatic authority, so she possessed a lot of experience and was used to these kinds of situations.

"Long time no see, Testarossa-dono. Thank you for the reinforcements."

Under different circumstances, there would've been things to take issue with in Gazel's reply. Formalities and etiquette were to be considered, and it would have been more normal to have a spokesman answer instead.

However, this was not the time to be talking about such things. Everyone understood this and decided to ignore the formalities and hold a strategy meeting.

![break]

They moved to the command post and everyone got down to business.

Testarossa, on behalf of Rimuru and the others, informed them of the plan. She then proposed the strategy that should be carried out in this area.

"Hmm. Rimuru striking the emperor directly, huh?"

"That's more realistic than a suicide mission."

"Is that so? It sounds like an absurd plan in and of itself..."

Gazel snorted as if in deep thought. Vaughn agreed that the situation had improved. Dolph agonized over whether there was anything else they could do.

There was no time to think about it. Since no one could come up with an alternative, Testarossa pushed the discussion forward.

"We will take care of Velgrynd-sama. The rest of you should work to stop the ritual taking place in the back."

"I have no objection."

Gazel agreed to the unsolicited offer. With the absence of any alternative options, the demon girls were the only ones who could be trusted with the most dangerous task. It was Jaine who put the breaks on.

"One moment. Testarossa-dono, can you, the Primordials, defeat the Scorch Dragon?"

This was an important question that would affect the entire operation. Velgrynd was so overwhelming that Jaine was convinced that Testarossa and her team could not win. There is no doubt that the three Primordials were their strongest force, but that made it all the more important to understand their odds of success. If Testarossa and the others were defeated here, the fate of everyone else would be sealed.

"Honestly, I don't think we can win."

"In that case you should stay on the defensive! Instead of provoking her rashly, why don't we wait here for His Majesty Rimuru's plan to succeed?"

With the odds against them, they should stall for time. Jaine's logic seemed sound, but Rimuru's forces rejected it outright.

"Unfortunately, we cannot do that. If we leave Velgrynd-sama alone, she may return to the Imperial City to interfere with His Lordship." Carrera spoke firmly with determination.

Although Rimuru had told them that they could leave Velgrynd alone, she had decided that they needed to draw her attention.

"More importantly, we did not come here to discuss a battle plan. We received an order from Rimuru-sama, and only came to tell you about it. I will consult with you if I can help, but I want you to know that I will not allow you to stand in our way."

Even the usually soft spoken Hakurou harshly expressed his disagreement. Time was short, so he valued clear intentions over etiquette.

Gazel got the message. He spoke quickly before his agitated companions could further object.

"If Hakurou-dono, my master, has said so, then I have no choice but to move aside. Otherwise, do you guys have a better idea?" Gazel asked.

His companions could only solemnly shake their heads.

"It will not be easy to interfere with the ritual with the Imperial Intelligence Bureau on the move. I think it is best to keep grounded here."

Dolph's statement was definitive. All that remained was to confirm the details before the operation commenced.


![soft scene break]


Provoking Velgrynd was exceedingly risky. The three demonesses were fully aware of this, but they still did not hesitate.

"Can we interfere with the ritual by dealing with her?" Ultima asked aloud.

"I wonder."

"I don't know, but even I would find it impossible to keep 'Gravity Collapse' running at that output," Carrera added. "And for her to maintain the magic and take on the three of us at the same time, absolutely impossible, right?"

"I believe she can pull it off, which is why I am rather wary," Testarossa muttered.

"You're kidding, right?"

"I'm quite serious."

"Oh well. No need to argue," Carrera exclaimed. "We'll find out soon enough."

Unperturbed, the three conversed freely. Then, without hiding, they walked straight towards Velgrynd in a dignified manner.

Naturally, Velgrynd was aware of them. However, she was not wary, but rather happily allowed the three demons to approach.

"Good day to you. It is a good day for a fight, is it not?"

Testarossa greeted, and Velgrynd responded with a smile.

"Yes, it is. But before we fight, let me ask you something. Why don't you join my side? You are Primordials of great strength. I promise to treat you well."

Before the three demons, Velgrynd kept her relaxed demeanor and made her offer. Needless to say, Testarossa and the others answered with a resounding no.

"I have history with the Empire, so allow me to reject that offer."

"Same for me. It's the first time I've had a master, and it's surprisingly comfortable. I don't want to give it up."

"As she said. More importantly, let's just end this conversation and get on with the fight. If you don't want to go one-on-three, you can call in the men behind you."

A clear rejection that left no room for negotiation.

Carrera, for her part, did not care about negotiating, and was in high spirits as she prepared for battle. Seeing Velgrynd's magic so close to her, her fighting instincts were on fire.

Velgrynd laughed. "So that's your answer. Okay then. In that case, I'll play with you guys for a bit!"

That was the signal for the battle to begin.

![break]

And then, slowly, right in front of Testarossa and the others, Velgrynd split. No... Like a reflection in the mirror, the number of Velgrynds increased to two.

Testarossa had an idea of what the phenomenon was.

"How troublesome. This isn't just a 'Clone.' If I had to say, this seems to be like Raine's 'Mist'."

Testarossa had fought Raine in the past. She forgot the cause of the dispute, but she had accumulated a lot of combat experience from the exchange. Raine's 'Mist' was a Skill that allowed her to generate a clone by splitting her body in half. However, unlike 'Split Body', only one of the two could carry consciousness. Even so, depending on how it was used, it could be vicious, and was perfect for catching an enemy off guard. Although it was difficult to use against cautious opponents, it was an ability with strong safety insurance.

However, considering that Velgrynd's Parallel Existence could create 'Split Bodies,' it could not be denied that it was superior in all respects. The difference between the two Skills was like heaven and earth.

Testarossa did not know this, but a shadow began showing on her beautiful face.

"What's that?"

"Raine, you see, can split her body and 'regenerate' from any one piece of flesh."

"I see. That means either one can be considered the main body, right?"

"That is the case."

Testarossa and the others analyzed the situation without rushing. Even though the battle had already begun, their attitude was just as unharried as when they were elegantly speaking a moment ago.

"Blanc is very clever, and yes, you're right," Velgrynd said, amused. "This is one of my powers, called 'Parallel Existence'. I don't want you to interfere with the ritual, so I'll deal with you here," she declared while gracefully waving her fan.

![full page image](image1)

Testarossa wasn't amused by that statement. The corners of her eyes were glinting as she glared at Velgrynd.

"I now have the name 'Testarossa' given to me by my lord, Rimuru-sama. I wish you would stop calling me Blanc."

As she said this, Testarossa casually twirled a flaming whip she had created out of nowhere. The whip twisted around like a snake as it attacked Velgrynd.

"I heard about that. So it's true that the slime has been naming Primordials."

With that bit of intel now confirmed, Velgrynd couldn't hide her surprise. However, her body remained undisturbed as she flicked away Testarossa's whip.

"It's rude to call His Lordship a slime," Carrera roared indignantly and unleashed her magic.

She opened with her trump card, 'Gravity Collapse,' right out of the gate. The scale was reduced in size as much as possible, thus increasing the intensity. The strongest attack that Carrera could currently muster hit Velgrynd, who was focused on Testarossa.

Velgrynd was enveloped in a jet-black pillar that seemed to connect heaven and earth. The circular pillar, which was only big enough to hold a single person, was like a prison from which there was no escape.

However...

Velgrynd smiled fearlessly, remaining unperturbed in the cage of hypergravity.

"As expected of a demon overlord. Your magic is perfectly powerful. However, for so long as you are bound by the laws of this world your attack won't work against a True Dragon."

As if to prove her point, Velgrynd shattered the jet-black pillar from within. She raised her own mana and interfered with Carrera's magic, rendering it powerless.

"Hahaha! As expected of Veldora-sama's sister, you're making it seem like a joke. If magic doesn't work, then there's nothing more I can do, huh? No! I have a sword technique I'm learning from Agera. It may be useless, but I'll give it a try!"

Carrera seemed to be enjoying herself, even though her best move had just been defeated. Without any sign of distress, she raised the sword she had created with magic. The beautiful sword had a fierce presence that was unbecoming of a demon. Carrera's magical energy flowed directly into the blade, giving it a radiant glow.

"This is most likely our only choice. It is not simple magic nor Skill, but a technique you have developed and improved yourself. It may work even against the True Dragons, the source of the world. Veldora-sama says that a woman named Hinata has proven this approach effective."

Without needing to test it, Testarossa knew that magic would not work on Velgrynd. That was why she had materialized a whip using magic from the very start. The whip was white---a magic formula devised by Testarossa, possessing a contradictory nature known as "freezing white flame."

"Hmm, humans are interesting after all. Maybe I'll use this too."

Saying this, Ultima materialized two knives and held them in her hands. The blades of the knives were a poisonous purple color and had a sinister aura around them.

"Ult, you're already getting serious from the start. Aren't those the same ones that wounded Zegion last time?"

"Well. Honestly, I thought it was pointless for us to move our bodies."

"Isn't it a surprise? I never thought my experience fighting Zegion-dono would come in so handy."

The girls were good at magic, and never really put much emphasis on close combat. However, in their battle against Zegion, all other means of attack had been ineffective. The reason for this was Zegion's ironclad defense as well as his absolute superiority over magic. Almost all magic was ineffective against Zegion. As a result, they had been forced to seek other means.

And the answer they came up with was this. They had finally succeeded in damaging Zegion with a blow infused with a strong force of will into which they poured their whole existence as a spiritual life form. For a spiritual life form, the power of the will triumphed over anyone. A Skill was just another form of will force created by the desire of each individual, and the ultimate culmination of that was the Ultimate Skill.

If that was the case, how close could their wills get to it? They concluded that they would just have to test it. By materializing their will, they created weapons that each of them was good at.

Zegion's defense was not inferior to an Ultimate Skill. Nevertheless, Ultima's knives had inflicted wounds on Zegion's body. In other words, the attacks of the three demon girls could reach the Ultimate Skill level.

"I tried to imitate Ult's weapon. My swordsmanship was just for fun, but Agera has taught me the intricacies of swordsmanship. Let me be your opponent!"

As soon as she said that, Carrera sprinted forward. Without any thought of defense, she slashed at Velgrynd with all her might.

Velgrynd parried the slash with her feather fan. It was made of high-grade feathers and could hardly be called a weapon. However, its strength had been altered by Velgrynd's demonic aura and was harder than a diamond. It was thin, light, flexible, and hard. It was not at all inferior to Carrera's sword and was Velgrynd's favorite weapon.

"I'm surprised that you Primordials are so quick to dismiss magic."

"Is it that surprising? What is our pride but a pittance in comparison to the victory we shall bring to our Lord?"

Testarossa's whip struck Velgrynd, who had turned to the defensive in the face of Carrera's onslaught. Like a white snake that had split into countless pieces, Testarossa hunted down her prey at will.

"Tsk!" Velgrynd clicked her tongue in annoyance. The hem of her dress was torn by the whip. A glimpse of her beautiful legs peeked out, and a bright red welt could be clearly seen there. It was proof that Testarossa's attack had worked.

"Nice work, Testa. I'll continue being the vanguard, so keep up the good work."

"I can't believe you're happy at such a fluke."

Even though she was slightly injured, Velgrynd was still relaxed and had plenty of time. That's why, while facing Testarossa and the others, she made a serious blunder. In other words, she had been careless.

"It wasn't a fluke, was it?!"

Ultima's triumphant voice sounded just as Velgrynd felt a pain in her side.

---*What?!*

A moment of confusion. As if aiming for that moment, Testarossa's whip and Carrera's sword strikes came one after the other.

Velgrynd fell to her knee. She could not immediately understand what had happened to her. No, it wasn't that she couldn't. Rather she didn't want to understand.

"That was a clean hit, Ultima. We shall ask Rimuru-sama for praise later."

"That was impressive, but we must not be careless. Let's keep this thing going!"

"Yeah! There's still another 'Parallel Existence' left, so let's kill that one too and interrupt the ritual!"

Hearing these voices in the distance, Velgrynd stood up.

"Oh my, it seems you didn't take too much damage from our attacks."

"Even I would take a long time to break the hold of Ult's 'poison curse.' True Dragons are really amazing."

"But you see, it's not like we can't beat her, right? The damage will accumulate; at this rate, she'll---"

Velgrynd moved fast, outpacing Ultima before she could finish her sentence. She grabbed Ultima by the neck and slammed her to the ground with such speed that even the three demon girls' super intuition could not detect her.

"Guha!"

Velgrynd kicked Ultima, who groaned involuntarily, and Velgrynd left the scene. Immediately after, Carrera's slash passed through the space where Velgrynd had been.

Velgrynd, now out of Carrera's range, pulled a knife stabbed in her side and threw it away. Her clothes were still torn, but there were no scars on her white skin. It was as if the damage caused by the barrage of attacks was nothing to Velgrynd.

"You really are a monster, after all."

Velgrynd responded to Carrera's mumbling with a slight self-mockery.

"Not really. I still have a long way to go. It's been a long time since I've been careless enough to get hurt. No. I could have been doing it habitually, but I just was not aware of it, since it never resulted in issues. It's like the fate of being the strongest, but you guys can understand that too, right?"

Velgrynd chuckled, but her eyes were sharp. She glared at Testarossa and the others, ready to notice the slightest movements. There was no hope for her to be caught off guard a second time, and thus, at this moment, Testarossa and the girls' chances of victory were reduced to zero.

"The Primordials really are troublesome, but that doesn't mean that they are a threat. It just means that they are a pain to deal with. However, I've changed my mind. Now that you've incarnated and been given names, you've become stronger than I ever imagined. I will acknowledge that."

Velgrynd was not underestimating the primordial demons. Even if their strength was not as great as hers, she could still benefit from their help. They could be of great help to Velgrynd when she challenged her sister, Velzard.

In fact, Velgrynd had been taken by surprise just now. If this had happened during a battle with her sister, Velgrynd's defeat would have been decisive. As proof of this, Testarossa and the others' attack had succeeded in ruining Velgrynd's 'Split Body'. Of course, she would recover in time. However, as Carrera had said, it was a painstaking task for Velgrynd to break Ultima's poison curse. So Velgrynd released the damaged 'Split Body' and created a new one. In this way, she made all her damage disappear.

Such usage was the essence of 'Parallel Existence'. No matter how powerful the killer move was, it was meaningless in the face of Velgrynd's power. However, this Skill was not all-powerful either. There were some restrictions on its use.

The biggest restriction was that for every 'Split Body' created, 10 percent of the maximum amount of magicules would be used as collateral. This was not a consumption, but a maintenance cost. The term 'collateral' was employed since she would get the magicules back once the 'Split Body' was erased. However, it was also an irrefutable fact that there was a limit to the number of 'Split Bodies' that could be created. The maximum number of 'Split Bodies' that Velgrynd could produce was ten. However, if Velgrynd created ten of them, the amount of magicules she had left would be zero, and her fighting ability would be reduced.

Velgrynd believed it would be more efficient to keep at least 50 percent of her magicules, since they could be shared with any 'Split Body'. Therefore, she kept the number of split bodies to three or four at most.

There was one more limitation. It was the damage done to the Split Body. If the body was erased without issue, the full 10 percent of magicules would be returned. However, if the body was damaged, the amount of magicule returned would be proportionally less. This was the strategy that Rimuru had envisioned, and in a sense, it was correct.

In this case, her magicules were depleted by five percent. Incidentally, Gravity Collapse, the nuclear magic that Carrera finally activated with all her might, had consumed less than one percent of Velgrynd's magicules. That was how enormous the amount of magicules in a True Dragon was.

Thus, Velgrynd was not completely immortal, even if she appeared invincible at first glance. Physical damage was pointless, but if you slowly depleted her energy, you would eventually be able to knock her down sooner or later.

Although the probability was very small, Velgrynd had come to realize this possibility. As some of the strongest in this world, they might be able to defeat her. Although she had said they were of no threat, that had just been a bluff to break their spirits.

Velgrynd was convinced. The three demon girls could be a useful trump card against Velzard. If she could get Testarossa and the others to join her in the fight against her sister, victory would be assured. That was why Velgrynd spoke words of invitation once more.

"You understand, don't you? No matter how much you struggle, you cannot defeat me, so there's no point in fighting any more, is there? Just help me out a little and I will give you your freedom, so why don't you just surrender to me now."

The offer was the biggest concession that the proud Velgrynd could make.

Nevertheless, the three ladies rejected it.

"You want me to betray Rimuru-sama? That's a funny joke."

"You know, you're really looking down on us too much. It's common knowledge that demons do not break their contracts, right? Just because we are losing does not mean we will betray him."

"You tell me. Certainly, there are some demons who can be negotiated with. There might even be some who only work with their own interests. But you should know that I would never betray His Lordship!"

Each of the three spoke their true feelings and unleashed a simultaneous attack on Velgrynd to remind her of their displeasure.

These attacks, with their maximum force, destroyed Velgrynd's 'Split Body' in an instant, causing Velgrynd to consume another nine percent of her magicules.

Negotiations had broken down.

"...Well then. That's unfortunate. Gravely." Velgrynd, who had created a new 'Split Body', muttered and gave a devastating smile.

And then, the time of thrashing had begun.


![hard scene break]


Gazel and the others set out on a plan to take a detour around the Gravity Collapse---the crimson pillar that was causing the rain of blood from the sky---and attack the site where Kagali was performing the ritual.

If they got too close, even the Pegasus Knights would be caught in the gravity waves. It was up to Dolph, the captain of the Pegasus Knights, to be cautious about that and lead the way. However, his fears were unfounded. The "Gravity Collapse" maintained by Velgrynd had completely blocked off any influence on the surroundings. On the ground, the battle between the demon girls and Velgrynd seemed to have begun. And yet, the crimson pillar was still standing strong.

Gazel felt a chill run down his spine as he grasped this fact. However, he did not show it and shouted loudly.

"It's hard to believe, but that is Velgrynd. To be able to produce a clone of the same level as the main body, what else could this be but a nightmare? But fear not. Know that we have powerful reinforcements that also defy logic!"

Gazel's voice reached the ears of the knights. It was imposing and majestic, and erased the fear from everyone's hearts.

Gazel, in truth, was terrified. In the face of such an overwhelming presence, there was little that a Saint could do. Even if they attempted to resist, the difference in power was too great. However, he did not give up. His sense of responsibility as a king strengthened his heart.

More importantly, the reinforcements from his beloved younger co-disciple (Rimuru) were showing him that it was too early to despair. The three demons Velgrynd was fighting now were inferior in terms of magicule quantity alone. Despite this, they were boldly challenging their opponent, who was almost a hundred times stronger than them.

*Kukuku, seeing them like that, how can I, as a king, complain about anything?*

Gazel made a strong vow in his heart. This resolve spread to Gazel's companions and the knights under his command. By the time they reached their destination, all the fear had vanished from their hearts.

![break]

On the other side of the crimson pillar was a battlefield that would be their destination. It was a large open grassland where a large army could be deployed. The ground was stained crimson with the color of blood. This was most likely the blood of the Empire Mixed Corps, which was making shady transactions---a proof of their demise. There were nearly a hundred people on the ground.

One man who stood out from the rest was Lieutenant Kondou, who wore a different uniform. He threw his gaze at Gazel, giving off an overwhelming presence.

In addition, Footman, Teare, and about thirty of Yuuki's former comrades were gathered here.

There were also nearly fifty Imperial Guardians. They were deployed to protect Kagali, determined not to let anything interfere with the ceremony.

On Kondou's side, a group of men in uniform could be seen. They were employees of the Intelligence Bureau, and some of them were also Imperial Guardians. In other words, the best of the Empire's forces were all gathered here.

In terms of location, Kagali was on the outer edge of the crimson pillar. She was immersed in a ritual, bathed in a rain of blood.

Velgrynd was standing on the sidelines, watching over her. After creating a 'Split Body' on the other side of the crimson pillar, she came back to this side to prevent the three demon girls from interfering with the magic. Even the mighty Velgrynd, with only one Split Body, would have her hands full casting one of the most powerful spells in the world.

For this reason, Velgrynd seemed to have no intention of making a move and instead planned to simply spectate the battle.

![break]

Gazel confirmed the situation in the sky. He then began his descent with calmness.

Kondou greeted Gazel and the others as they landed on the ground.

"It is an honor to finally meet you---the famed champion---King Gazel," Kondou spoke brazenly.

Gazel snorted and raised his sword.

"And you are?"

"Head of the Imperial Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant Kondou."

"So, you're the 'Information Monster.' Interesting. I shall be your opponent, so quickly draw your sword."

Gazel recognized Kondou's strength at a glance. When his skill 'Though Read,' which he used the moment they got face to face, didn't work, he considered him to be his equal.

"Hey, hey, he will be my---"

"Vaughn, I need you to stay out of the way and take care of the others. You guys too. I am the only one who can handle him."

Gazel looked around at the others who entered this decisive battle and spoke up to them.

Jaine was the first to nod in agreement at Gazel's order. "That's right. That person is a bit more than we can handle. Let us at least remove the obstacles and allow King Gazel to fight in peace."

Jaine's decision was met with a nod from Dolph. "...Understood. Everyone, listen up! They may be outnumbered, but do not underestimate our opponent's strength! Form into groups of five and engage in aerial combat!"

He assessed the enemies and gave out an appropriate instruction.

An unobstructed assault from above was the Pegasus Knights' main tactic. This time, however, the strategy was to take advantage of their greater numbers and mess with the enemy.

Yuuki's comrades and the Imperial Guardians were as strong as the Sage class. Sage level was equivalent to Special A rank in the Freedom Association's threat scale which was as strong as an archdemon. Those at this level were worthy of being called champions, as they could reach the Demon Lord Seed if they were cultivated properly.

Dolph's subordinates were only Over A rank when working together with a pegasus. Dolph himself was a sage, and while some of his men were stronger than others, they appeared to be no match in a one-on-one battle.

Dolph did not see it exactly, but he could feel on his skin that the opposing troops were dangerous. While the chances were better than fighting Velgrynd, he believed it would not be an equitable fight. That was why he gave such an order.

The goal was not to destroy the enemy, but to distract the enemy by using the advantage of flying. Buying time by doing so was Dolph's true purpose. He wanted to stay out of Gazel's way.

The Pegasus Knights read his intentions and reacted immediately.

*I shall do my part, trusting that His Majesty will win. Besides, the reinforcements will be here soon!*

Dolph had made his decision. And it was affirmed by a cheerful voice.

"Gwahahaha! We're a little late, so it seems. This big thing was heavier than I thought, so we had a hard time carrying it. But now that we're here, rest assured! Take pleasure in this battle with peace of mind!!"

It was Gabil.

"Whooo! That's Gabil-sama for you, so cool!"

"Aye."

"You're getting more and more manly. I will follow you anywhere, so you better be prepared!"

And Gabil's men.

Held in the hands of the Hiryuu members was a chain that connected them to a huge object. It was the Demon Colossus. It had taken a hundred people to bring it here by air. The Demon Colossus had no issues waiting for the enemy in the labyrinth, but its massive body was a liability when it came to the battlefield. Its fighting ability was perfect, but its movement speed was very slow. Even so, its melee speed was so fast that the problem had been overlooked until now.

"This problem needs improvement, but now that you've brought it this far, I shall do my best," Gadra exclaimed enthusiastically. Now was the time to return the favor he said, entering the Demon Colossus with a motivated look on his face.

Gadra turned his gaze to Kondou, but quickly averted it. Seeing that King Gazel was dealing with him, he felt that he should not interfere.

And then he took notice of Velgrynd. *So, Marshal-dono's true identity was the Scorch Dragon Velgrynd after all. But if so, I don't understand Damrada's intentions. Did he really swear an oath of allegiance to His Majesty? Why did he need to order Bernie and Jiwu to protect Masayuki? I don't understand. I don't, but... Now is not the time to worry about that. If Velgrynd makes a move, the mission is over. I'll have to keep an eye on her to make sure that doesn't happen.*

With that in mind, Gadra sent the Demon Colossus towards the elegantly standing Velgrynd.

![break]

After seeing Gadra off, Gabil flew to Dolph's side.

"It seems Gadra-dono has volunteered to take care of Velgrynd-sama. We will eliminate those who will be in the way, as planned."

"Fufufu, how reliable, Gabil-dono. In that case, let us get to work on the joint operation."

"Yes. My team will take the lead against the enemy and leave the support to you!"

"Understood!!"

Gabil and Dolph nodded at each other.

As agreed upon in advance, the Hiryuu, with their excellent fighting ability, would take the lead. The dragonewts, with their superior defensive capabilities, would not be easily killed. In addition, Gabil's team was lavishly supplied with full potions. As long as they didn't die instantly, they could be revived, making them a good shield.

"Now then, Dolph-dono, I'll leave the command to you."

"Huh, wait?!"

Dolph was surprised by Gabil's undiscussed action.

"Gwahahaha! I am the 'Draco Lord' Gabil! Let's fight without cowardice!"

Gabil was unconcerned about Dolph's behavior and launched an assault towards what appeared to be Kondou's close associates---one of them.

![break]

Seeing Gabil, Gobua could only stare blankly. They had been the last to arrive, but it couldn't be helped as they had run across the ground. Even so, their speed was commensurate with their Over A rank, and they were just in time for the start of the war.

Not only that, but they had managed to get behind the enemy troops as planned.

"The fact that Gabil-sama went alone means that the man's ability must be outstanding."

Gobua's comment was countered by the man standing beside her.

"Is that so? I can only see a weak, bespectacled kid who's good at paperwork, though?"

It was Phobio, the Black Leopard Fang of Karion's Beastketeers. For some reason, he hadn't returned to his home country, but had followed Gobua before he knew it.

Inwardly, Gobua was happy, but she was still in charge of the Kurenai by Benimaru's orders. She had to be stern in official duties, and so cautioned Phobio.

"Phobio-dono, your abilities are commendable, but you would do well to develop a better eye for the strength of your enemies."

"That's harsh, Gobua. Drop the honorific, call me Phobio."

"This is wartime and we're on a mission. I expect you to keep your private and public life in order."

The two of them continued their conversation, but to their subordinates, it just looked like they were flirting. It was a tense battlefield, but for some reason there was a warm feeling in the air.

"So, what happens after this?" Phobio asked, his expression suddenly turning serious.

Gobua changed her mindset and responded. "We will stay here and bide our time. We have already failed to achieve our tactical victory conditions, and now the mission is doomed to failure. Depending on what Velgrynd-sama does, we'll be wiped out. If all we wish to do is survive, the best choice is to run away, but that is not an option we can take. In short, the most important thing is to reduce the number of people in our way and lighten the burden of His Majesty Rimuru as much as possible."

It was the expression of someone who had made up their mind.

If they kept Velgrynd here, then Rimuru would be able to take advantage of the opportunity and take out Emperor Rudra. Or, perhaps, get him to agree to a ceasefire agreement, which had been the point of the operation. However, that plan collapsed when Velgrynd released a 'Split Body'. Normally, all operations should have been suspended at that point, but the people with the authority to make that decision were currently unreachable.

Gabil was the supreme decision maker in this situation. And Gabil's decision was to continue the operation. Testarossa and the others agreed, and Gobua had no objections.

*Do what you can*. That was all.

It was unclear how many 'Split Bodies' Velgrynd could produce, but they were prepared to stall them all. And if possible, they were going to interrupt the ritual Kagali was performing.

"Are you trying to kill yourself?"

"No. His Majesty Rimuru will never allow us to die. So, no casualties will be allowed."

At Gobua's outrageous command, the Kurenai all nodded quietly.

"If Velgrynd moves, there's nothing we can do to stop her, right?"

"If she does, we'll leave her to Gadra-dono and run." Gobua gave a wink in response.

That look had enough destructive power to shut Phobio up.

"Fine. I'm going to stop thinking so hard and go a little wild. It looks like I have a history with some of these guys, so I should say hello."

Phobio had once been tricked by Footman and Teare and had made a painful mistake in the past. However, he didn't hold a grudge against them because it was all due to his inexperience. On the contrary, he was even grateful to them, believing that he had been able to grow from that experience.

He was a simple and vivacious man, just like a beastman ought to be. It was precisely because he was such a man that seeing his nemesis being manipulated gave him something to think about.

"Don't do anything rash."

"I can't promise that, but I swear I'll try not to die."

With these words, Phobio joined the fight.

![break]

Lieutenant Kondou faced King Gazel. The bespectacled intelligence officer was spotted by Gabil.

Footman and Teare headed for Vaughn and Anrietta. Phobio intervened, and Gobua and the others tried to assess the situation.

In front of Velgrynd who was contemptuously looking at the battlefield, was a Demon Colossus controlled by Master Gadra.

And thus, the battles began.


![hard scene break]


In the midst of the battlefield, Gazel's mind was as calm as a tranquil sea. He was facing the man Kondou, not as a king, but as a warrior and a swordsman.

Kondou drew his military sword as Gazel had told him to do. He, too, quietly exhaled in admiration at Gazel's stance.

"Well, that's impressive. I guess the title of Sword Saint was not an exaggeration."

These words were not flattery, and he meant them sincerely. But Gazel snickered back.

"Speak for yourself. Such words only sound sarcastic when spoken by someone like you."

Those were his true feelings.

Kondou's stance was beautiful, and Gazel could see no flaw in it. Kondou now was holding his sword in both hands, unlike when he had fought Footman, he was in a serious stance. And there was an even more surprising fact. The two men's stances were as identical as if they had rehearsed it together.

They exchanged blows for a few rounds in silence, and both of them largely grasped the other's strength. They were convinced that it was no coincidence that their stances were identical. Gazel's swordsmanship had been learned from Hakurou, and although he incorporated his own techniques, his basic stance was faithful to Hakurou's teachings.

It was handed down from Hakurou's grandfather, Byakuya Araki, as the "Oboro-Ryu."^[This can be translated as something like the "Haze" style.] There was no one else but Hakurou to whom this school of swordsmanship was passed down. Even Gazel, who was a direct disciple of Hakurou, did not know everything about the Oboro-Ryu. He knew there were secrets yet to be discovered.

But even so...

In the country of monsters, Hakurou was involved in the training of soldiers as the instructor. Naturally, he would have taught them the basics of swordsmanship, but it was unlikely that this would have been spread to the Empire.

To begin with, swordsmanship was not something that could be learned overnight. That is why Gazel asked the question. And strangely, the same question came out of Kondou.

"That stance, how do you know Oboro-Ryu?"

"I had suspected it when I heard about it, but His Majesty Gazel's technique is similar to my "Oboro Shinmei-Ryu." Who did you learn it from?"

"..."

"..."

They stared at each other.

Gazel was the first to open his mouth. "Oboro Shinmei-Ryu...so it's not the same as Oboro-Ryu, you say?"

Kondou accepted the question without expression and pondered for a moment.

*In the Dwarven Kingdom, orthodox swordsmanship using a combination of a one-handed sword and a shield is the mainstream. That means this must have something to do with the information I got about a certain monster who is very skilled with a sword.*

From the little information he had, Lieutenant Kondou arrived at a mostly correct answer.

Gazel asked Kondou a question as if he was impatient.

"Are you not going to answer my question?"

"Please do not be impatient. The Oboro-Ryu is probably of the same school as the one I learned. That is why I would like to ask you a question instead. Isn't it impossible that the same school of swordsmanship could have been created from this world by chance?"

"Hmm, that's true..."

While muttering, Gazel remembered. He recalled a story about Hakurou's grandfather which had been told to him during his training.

"I was told by my master Hakurou-dono that the Oboro-Ryu was instilled in him by his grandfather. I heard that he was a "visitor" from another world which would make sense."

Unknown to both Gazel and Kondou, Byakuya Araki had a younger brother. That person had replaced his brother as the founder of the school and introduced the "Oboro Shinmei-Ryu" in the world where Kondou was born.

It was to fight against the mountain and river monsters^[The word used was "chimimoryō" which is a Chinese/Japanese term for monster and river monsters from ancient times.] as *the sword that dispelled evil*. Kondou was one of those who had fought against evil and had been learning the Oboro Shinmei-Ryu from a position close to the source.

"Kukuku, it's interesting to know that we are fellow students."

Kondou began to laugh in a rare and amused way. He was not usually one to reveal his emotions, so this laughter seemed to highlight his coldness.

"I have a proposal, Your Majesty Gazel."

"What is it?"

"A fellowship. I have determined that His Majesty Gazel is powerful enough to join our ranks. If you disarm and promise to swear allegiance to my Emperor, I promise to cease all acts of aggression against your country."

"What makes you think I'll accept that offer?"

"I think you will. Rationally speaking, it is the best way to minimize casualties."

*He's right*---that's what Gazel thought. It was a desperately needed offer. In order to protect the people of the Dwarven Kingdom, it would be correct to accept the offer. As a monarch, he should accept it without question.

Now that the threat of Velgrynd was known, there was no way to win. The conditions for victory in this battle were so vague that they should never have been set in the first place. Before heavy casualties were inflicted, Rimuru and the others would settle things with Rudra---it was wishful thinking.

*If it's for the sake of the people---*

Almost considering it, Gazel chuckled to dispel his doubts.

"Ridiculous! You think you've already won; has no one told you overconfidence is one's greatest enemy?! See how I correct you for your arrogant thoughts!!"

While shouting this, Gazel focused his thoughts on the enemy in front of him. Chasing away all distractions, he thought only of defeating Kondou. Then, with mind, body, and his beloved sword as one, he unleashed the full force of his haki as Saint. What appeared there was a champion who could almost reach the level of an awakened demon lord.

Even so, Kondou's demeanor remained relaxed even when he saw Gazel.

"My my, it seems you are a wise king in name only. In that case it can't be helped. I will take care of you before your reputation goes down the drain."

Those words signaled the beginning of a battle between the "Saints."

![break]

A few minutes had passed. Kondou was starting to gain the upper hand. He could easily cancel out Gazel's 'champion's haki.' By wearing the same quality of aura, he was able to nullify all effects.

It was the same even in pure swordplay. Gazel unleashed a series of vertical slashes with "Oboro Chiten Gourai,"^[I think this means something like 'Haze: Heaven and Earth Thunderous Roar' but it's not 100% accurate.] but Kondou, whilst shifting his body to evade the attacks, swiftly unleashed a sideways counterattack with the "Shippu-Raiha"^[I think this means something like "Gale-Thunder Supreme"]. Kondou then connected it with his fastest thrust, the "Shiden Totsu,"^[I believe this means something like 'Purple Lightning Thrust'] but Gazel parried it back with a "Ryusui Zan."^[I believe this means something like 'Flowing Water Slash.']

The two fellow students knew each other's techniques very well. However, Gazel's response gradually began to lag. Kondou had mastered more techniques than him.

"I knew it. There are some techniques that I have never seen before in the Oboro Shinmei-Ryu. Even I, a close follower of the original art, do not know all of them. Hakurou, was it? I was skeptical about how much a mere monster could comprehend the true nature of the sword."

That was Kondou's honest opinion. However, it was not meant as a mockery of Hakurou. The way of the sword was profound and had been handed down from generation to generation. Kondou himself was proud of his own school, and that is why he said what he said. However, his comment struck a nerve in Gazel.

"Are you insulting my master?"

He glared at Kondou with more determination than ever.

But then, someone arrived.

"Hohoho. King Gazel, you're not trained enough if you easily lose your cool on the battlefield. I will take your place for a while, so you can stay there and cool your head."

Hakurou, who had been leading the rear troops as Gobua's advisor, arrived late.


![soft scene break]


Kondou could see through Hakurou's strength at a glance.

The next moment, the clear sound of steel clashing with steel echoed through the air. Hakurou had caught Kondou's extremely fast quick-draw slash with his own cane-sword.

"Huh? You can stop this?"

On Hakurou's forehead, his 'Third Eye,' the 'Celestial Eye' was opened. It had now broken through the realm of Extra Skills and was about to exceed the realm of Unique Skills. That was why he was able to deal with Kondou's quick-draw sword technique.

"Excellent sword-drawing technique. I would call it anything but a strange coincidence that you are of the same school as my grandfather? Kid, you can test and see just how far I, whom you call a mere monster, can understand the true essence of the sword."

"Fufu, interesting. If you say that much, then I shall cut you down to size."

And so, before Gazel's eyes, the battle between Kondou and Hakurou began.

![break]

Kondou had the best odds to win. Hakurou's ability was certain, he could see that at a glance. But there was no doubt in Kondou's mind that monsters did not understand the true essence of the sword.

This was because the Oboro Shinmei-Ryu was the sword that dispelled evil. There was no way that a monster could learn a sword art designed specifically to combat them---it was only natural for Kondou to think that. Besides, it was beyond anyone's imagination that the true founder, the elder brother of Oboro Shinmei-Ryu founder, had come to this world in the first place.

*It surprised me that he could even perform the secret techniques, but those that go beyond the hidden techniques can only be passed on to individuals who are descended from the original line. I'm not sure how proficient the "visitor" was, but it would be impossible for him to teach the hidden techniques to a monster.*

In a way, it was inevitable that Kondou had made a judgment based on his own common sense.

That was a big mistake, and an unusual assumption for Kondou. It was a big price to pay...

Hakurou and Kondou faced each other. Then, as soon as they got at a deadly distance, they simultaneously launched their attacks.

"Baika Gokatotsu."^[Baika, Gokatotsu translates to something like "Plum Blossom, Five Petal Thrust"]

Kondou, with his pride as a swordsman, showed off his well-honed technique. It was only because Hakurou was a fellow student of the same school that he had made such a foolish move. In the back of his mind, he was calmly thinking that he should get serious and finish it quickly. Yet, the action he'd taken was intended for showing off.

This is a rash conduct that was out of character for Kondou, who was usually calm and composed. He intended to impress his peers in this world by demonstrating the greatest technique he had learned.

The "Gokatotsu" was a stabbing technique that symbolized the plum blossom. It was the finest technique that Kondou had been taught and was one of the hidden techniques that have never been passed down to outsiders. It consisted of five stabs aimed at five of the ten vital points of the human body---the eyes, throat, heart, kidneys, solar plexus, crotch, and also both shoulders as a feint. The aim was changed according to the situation, so it required a skillful technique.

Even among his peers, there were very few who had mastered this hidden technique. That is why it was a miscalculation to find Hakurou in such a place.

"Yaezakura Hakkasen."^[Yaezakura, Hakkasen translates to something like "Double Cherry Blossom, Eight Petal Flash." Yaezakura is a double cherry blossom tree, or cherry blossoms with more than five petals.]

Hakurou's choice was a supreme technique---a series of continuous flowing slashes, in an infinite variety of combinations, that would slay the enemy eight times in an instant.

Kondou and Hakurou were evenly matched in Proficiency, but there is a great difference between them in basic combat ability. In Hakurou's opinion, Kondou boasted a physical ability more than ten times greater than that of Hakurou. That is why Hakurou's defeat would be certain if his technique did not work.

With that determination in mind, Hakurou pulled out his sword.

"Nuu?!"

"Oh..."

Kondou had won overwhelmingly.

Hakurou had wanted to strike a fatal blow to Kondou, even if it meant they would both get hit.

That was what he had hoped for, but the result was something the both of them did not expect. Hakurou's sword scattered like eight petals at a speed that no one else could even see. However, all of them were canceled out by Kondou's five petals, and the attack ultimately missed.

As a result of Kondou avoiding getting hit at the lower portion of his body, a graze to the cheek was the most that could be done. Still, this was a disappointing result from Kondou's point of view.

"I didn't think there was a swordsman in this world who was better than me."

Hakurou's "Hakkasen" was superior to Kondou's "Gokatotsu." This fact shattered Kondou's perception and made him admit to his mistake.

However, it was Kondou who won the battle. The difference in strength was too great even though Hakurou was able to cancel his special move. Hakurou's arms were torn apart by the recent exchange, rendering them useless.

"Even with the supreme technique, I could not reach you..."

"No, you did. I apologize for looking down on you. Also, I would like to ask you. What was your grandfather's name?"

Kondou apologized for looking down on Hakurou as a monster. He also acknowledged that Hakurou was a better swordsman than himself and paid him that respect.

He was a man who was sincere about the sword. But at the same time, he did not judge things based on his personal feelings. That is who Kondou Tatsuya was.

"Hohoho. Byakuya Araki was my grandfather's name. He was a great swordsman, but he left for the afterlife^[They use a phrase here that also translates to "left to the road of the underworld."] a long time ago."

"That is a shame. Araki is the name of his family. Perhaps he is related to the founder of the Oboro Shinmei-Ryu. If he had reached Sage level, he would have been one of the strongest swordsmen in this world."

With that, Kondou said a silent prayer. He was truly a man who was serious only for his own school of sword. Hakurou looked at Kondou in dismay and asked him a question, thinking it was worth the try.

"My grandfather was an eccentric man who liked living an ordinary life. More importantly though, would you mind retreating here?"

Sensing Kondou's respect for him as well, Hakurou made his request. However, the request was rejected.

"I can at least guarantee your personal safety, but the war cannot be stopped. I have a belief that the worst thing one can do is to do things half heartedly," Kondou spoke with no doubts.

*Well, I suppose that's true,* Hakurou thought to himself.

Hakurou was not in a hurry.

*I already considered I was going to lose. It is impossible for me to get back into the fight with these arms, but I believe I've achieved my goal.*

That's right, Hakurou's goal was not to win, but to show Gazel the battle between himself and Kondou. The sword saint Gazel Dwargo would have understood Hakurou's technique just by looking at it. Even if he couldn't learn it right away, he would have been able to get some sort of hint. That was Hakurou's idea.

And this time, even Kondou had used his secret technique. This surely increased Gazel's chances of winning.

"Then, I will stop here. I do not need your protection. I have no intention to live in shame. In my final moments, I plan to take out as many enemy soldiers as I can. But now is not the time. I shall concentrate on healing these hands."

Hakurou's hands were badly injured and wouldn't recover even with a full potion^[Fuse created miracle potions early on and now has to keep adding restrictions to them, resulting in weirdly inconsistent and specific excuses for them not working, to salvage a semblance of having stakes.]. The secret of the 'Battlewill' was to destroy the target by permeating fighting aura in them. Kondou's fighting aura had penetrated Hakurou's defenses. Because of this, there was no way to heal the injuries except by neutralizing them with his own demonic aura.

However, Hakurou turned to Gazel with a nonchalant look on his face.

"Well then, King Gazel. Has your head cooled down?"

"Of course, I got excited, seeing my master's skills."

"Hohoho. The truth is I really had no intention of teaching you, but I can't say that now. I will leave the rest to you."

"Please leave it to me."

After Hakurou stepped back, Gazel stood before Kondou.

Meanwhile, Hakurou left the front line with his head held high, as if his role was now over.


![soft scene break]


Once again, Kondou and Gazel faced each other.

Kondou was ashamed of his shallowness, but quickly changed his mindset.

"I lost my cool for a bit, but playtime is over. It's time to get back to work."

"Hmph! I'm reluctant, but I agree with you. I must live up to my master's expectations, so I must get serious."

Both Kondou and Gazel acted differently from earlier. They had finished assessing each other's abilities and had become serious.

As for Gazel, he was grateful to Hakurou. If he had fought Kondou the way he was, he would have been defeated. The hidden technique that Kondou displayed, the 'Gokatotsu,' was impossible to defend against at first sight. Even if he had miraculously avoided a fatal wound, he would have been destroyed from the inside by the fighting aura, just like Hakurou had been, and would have been rendered incapable of fighting.

*I didn't realize that a refined fighting aura would pose such a threat. I knew that it was the secret of the Battlewill, but it seems that I hadn't fully understood it yet.*

As he reflected on this, Gazel felt his spirits lift. He realized that he could still get stronger.

"Kondou, isn't it? I will give you a taste of my full power."

As soon as he said this, Gazel released his trump card.

"Spirit Summoning! Come, nameless Spirit King of the Earth!!"

The summoned Spirit King of the Earth dwelled within Gazel, who had unleashed his power as a Saint. It was completely 'unified' and had an energy that rivaled or almost surpassed that of an old, awakened demon lord. Although there was a time limit, this was Gazel's trump card.

Kondou, however, was unfazed.

"What nonsense."

Kondou spoke blandly, unperturbed by Gazel's domineering aura.

Gazel did not show any displeasure at his words, but silently held his sword up to his eyes. He sharpened his mind, refined his will, and let it flow into the sword.

![full page image](image2)

Gazel was now in perfect control of the enormous amount of energy that had 'unified' with the Spirit King of the Earth. It was a feeling that he hadn't felt before.

*He truly is an incredible master. He helped me realize the secret. I can win. As I am now, the current me can reach even greater heights!*

Gazel felt the improvement in his 'mind,' 'technique,' and 'body.' By 'mind,' it was his Skill. By fully utilizing the Unique Skill 'Dictator', Gazel's willpower was at full power. By 'technique,' it was his Arts. In the Oboro-Ryu he learned from Hakurou, the 'Battlewill'---the art of transforming willpower into physical power is crucial. The current Gazel would be able to efficiently converge all the energy that flowed through his body. And that was the 'body.' In other words, he would use the Unique Skill 'Dictator' to consolidate his energy and convert it into the greatest blow.

*No one can defeat my sword*---with such a drive, Gazel made his move. A blow of divine speed.

However, it would never reach Kondou.

*Pwang!* A small sound rang out and Gazel fell to his knees.

"Kah!"

Gazel coughed up blood and looked dumbfounded at the blood seeping down his abdomen.

In Kondou's right hand was a Nambu pistol, a cloud of gunpowder still smoking from the muzzle. The lethal bullet that had defeated Gazel had been fired from that very pistol.

"You... Your pride as a swordsman."

Gazel, his face twisted in anger and humiliation, shouted while coughing up blood.

But those words fell on deaf ears to Kondou.

"I told you, play time's over. There is no need for pride on the battlefield. My job is to win by any means necessary."

Kondou spoke in a terribly cold voice. He was a different person from the one who had been so obsessed with his own school of swordsmanship up until now.

"Forget that! I won't let this be the end---"

Gazel desperately tried to stand up. However, his body couldn't move as he wanted, and he fell to the ground once again.

It was only natural. The bullet Kondou had shot was not ordinary, but rather a special bullet that contained Kondou's own will--- Necrosis. It was not something borrowed from Emperor Rudra, but an Ultimate Skill that Kondou had manifested on his own.

Yes---Kondou had awakened to the ultimate power by his own ability. The Ultimate Skill 'Conviction King Sandalphon' was one that governed "battle." As such, it was very strong.

He was the one who fought on behalf of Rudra---he who desired to attain the throne of God despite being human. And Necrosis, which Kondou used earlier, was one of the powers of the 'Conviction King Sandalphon.' It had the effect of destroying the target's mana circuits and could even kill spiritual life forms.

Gazel was by no means weak. On the contrary, he was one of the most powerful beings in this world. Depending on the conditions, he was capable of defeating even an awakened demon lord. Nevertheless, there was a strength barrier between him and Kondou that could not be overcome.

It was the existence of an Ultimate Skill. In this aspect alone, the battle had already been decided before the fight.

"Give up your futile efforts. I have no intention of killing Your Majesty. I will detain you for the time being, but I promise to release you once I'm done."

Kondou spoke in an indifferent voice.

While it was not a falsehood, it was not the whole truth, either. Before letting him go, he was planning to take control of him with the 'Dominion Bullet.' Now that he was currently in control of Kagali, he wanted to capture him alive.

Terrifyingly ruthless, and rational. This was another essence of Kondou Tatsuya.

![break]

Hakurou was not in a position to move right now. He could only stand there, resigned at the sight of Kondou's strength.

At this point, it appeared as if Kondou's victory was assured...


![hard scene break]


"Gwahahaha! I am the Draco Lord Gabil! Let's fight without cowardice!!"

Shouting this, Gabil identified the enemy and charged, leaving his subordinates behind. Although this was an inappropriate act for a commander, it was not a mistake from a tactical standpoint.

Because the enemy's strength was exceptional. The enemy was not conspicuous within the group, simply a good-looking bespectacled man. Nevertheless, Gabil called out in a loud voice without any sign of hesitation.

"You there. That man there, do not hesitate and be my opponent!!"

When Gabil pointed his spear at him, the man with the glasses twisted his lips into a smile.

"So, it's come to this. I was playing the part of an ordinary intelligence officer, and now I've been spotted by someone who sees right through me."

While saying this, the gentleman took off his glasses.

Immediately after that, the atmosphere around the man changed.

"In that case, it can't be helped, so allow me to be your opponent. But before that...my seniors, please stay away from here."

The man's usual timid character had disappeared as he ordered the others around him.

However, this did not go down well with his confused companions.

"Hey now, Marco, aren't you not cut out for fighting?!"

"Yeah, you're weaker than us, so stop acting so tough."

The man called Marco smiled back at the worried voices of his companions.

"Ah well, it was a really comfortable place to work. My true identity is a Single Digit, Number 8. You know what that means, don't you?"

Seeing how their peer's demeanor had changed, everyone understood that Marco had been playing the good-natured intelligence officer in disguise. And they understood that he had the right to give them orders, and what he had just said was true.

"Understood!"

"Good luck!!"

Leaving those words behind, Marco's companions scattered. He let out a sigh of relief and turned his snake-like narrowing eyes to Gabil. Marco, too, had seen through Gabil's strength.

In this world, it was meaningless to challenge an outstanding individual with a group. Marco was well aware of this and drove away even those who were as strong as an Imperial Knight.

"Wasn't it Gabil-san; you've done it now. You must pay for the crime of robbing me of my office lifestyle."

"Gwahahaha! The Single Digits are the ones Rimuru-sama considered as dangerous. To be able to deal with such prey, it looks like an opportunity has come my way!" Gabil replied happily.

Thus, the battle between the two men began.

.........

......

...

Marco was a man who was characterized by his lack of notable features. He became an Imperial Knight about 800 years ago. Because he possessed the Unique Skill 'Impersonator', a Skill specialized in undercover, he had caught the attention of Damrada, the Commander at that time. The Unique Skill 'Impersonator' had a noteworthy power. It was the ability to transform into the exact likeness of the person he saw. It was not a 'duplicate' like the Unique Skill 'Usurper' that Hinata possessed; it could entirely mimic the same person. However, there was a limit to how much he could mimic. If the target was significantly more powerful than him, he could not mimic everything---that was its weakness.

But even so, the more powerful people he met, the more versatile their strength would become. That was why Marco had risen to the rank of a Single Digit after overcoming a great upheaval and awakening as a Saint.

That was about a hundred years after Marco became an Imperial Knight. It was precisely because of this that Marco could not shake his awe of the man Kondou. Even if he was a "visitor" from another world and possessed a soul more powerful than that of ordinary people, his strength was still difficult to comprehend.

The first person Kondou challenged in the rank battles was Marco. In that battle, Marco was exposed to Kondou's extraordinary strength. He had always thought that Kondou was favored by the emperor, but now he realized that he had been wrong.

Kondou possessed a fighting ability that even Marco, a 'Saint,' could not imitate with his Unique Skill 'Impersonator.' With this ability, Kondou easily defeated the top soldiers to get the position of a commander. Even the four horsemen, who were all monsters in Marco's eyes, had been defeated by Kondo without a hitch.

For this reason, Marco worshiped Kondou. He even emulated Kondou's insistence on the rank of Lieutenant and kept his own rank of Ensign. He had stayed in the Intelligence Bureau just to serve Kondou.

Marco was now facing a powerful opponent by the name of Gabil. He also fought back with a spear but realized that he could not win the battle as it was. That is why Marco decided to change himself into the form of the person he believed to be the strongest.

.........

......

...

Marco distanced himself from Gabil and transformed into the form of Kondou. By adding the Ultimate Enchantment 'Alternative' lent by the Emperor to the Unique Skill 'Impersonator', it was possible to transform with even greater precision. The current Marco had power close to that of Kondou.

"Hoh, that's strange. Is that what you really look like?"

Gabil asked, to which Marco, in the form of Kondou, replied.

"No. This figure is a replica of who I believe to be the strongest man I know. The Four Horsemen were strong too, but not as strong as Lieutenant Kondou. In fact---"

Marco glanced at the battlefield next to him and continued.

"It seems even His Majesty King Gazel, the renowned champion, is no match for him."

Upon hearing this, Gabil let out a low "Mmm." He knew from his wide-range 'Magic Perception' that the allied forces were not doing well, that Hakurou had left the front lines, and that King Gazel was struggling, as had just been pointed out.

"Hmm, it seems so."

"From the moment that Lieutenant Kondou appeared, there was no doubt that we would win. That's why I didn't want to bother to show my own hand. You never know where the leak will come from and you always want to keep your power hidden, right?"

With that carefree question, Marco changed his weapon from a spear to a sword. The Legendary-grade armor Marco had been lent now allowed him to change its shape at will. Marco held his sword in his Kondou form. His appearance was regal.

Gabil also held a magical weapon, the Vortex Spear, which was the treasure of the lizardmen. It was a spear entrusted to him by his father, Abil, and he was now familiar with it. The spear had seen many fierce battles and had been reforged by Kurobee when it was damaged. Its performance was unique-grade, but it had been a very reliable partner.

However, it still fell short of the legendary-grade. It is true that the difference in weapon performance is a factor that determines the winner, and this time, Gabil was at an overwhelming disadvantage. However, Gabil also had the 'Dragon Skin', which was strong enough to reach the mythical-grade level.

Gabil believed that his enemy was a 'Saint,' and that he was equal to his awakened self. That is why Gabil did not spare any effort from the beginning, and gave it his all.

*Will this person be able to penetrate my defenses?*

Gabil was confident in his defensive capabilities. There was no victory in a fight unless you could inflict decisive damage on your opponent. It didn't matter how many blows you hit, if they were not fatal, they were meaningless.

Gabil thought that Marco's weapon would not be able to break through his defenses, but he was not about to let his guard down, and would carefully watch his opponents moves.

"Here I go."

"Hm, bring it on!"

Gabil's misfortune was that he had become hostile to Marco too early. The power he had awakened was vast, but he had yet to fully harness it for himself. As Ultima had feared, even in his pre-evolutionary stage, Gabil had not handled his magicules well enough. Even with such great power in his hands, Gabil was unable to use it to the full potential. High defense and healing ability---these two things alone were strong enough, but this time, his opponent was too strong.

"Baika Gokatotsu."

"Vortex Crash!!"

Gabil was able to survive because of his cautious approach.

The two were evenly matched in strength or Gabil slightly above. However, in terms of Proficiency , Marco, who was impersonating Kondou, was far superior. Actually, Marco could not even imitate 80 percent of Lieutenant Kondou's abilities. The Ultimate Skill 'Conviction King Sandalphon' was impossible to reproduce, and if Gazel had been his opponent, defeat would have been inevitable.

In terms of Marco's plain strength, he was evenly matched with Gabil. In terms of defense, Gabil's victory would have been assured.

Victory or defeat was all a matter of chance. Although Marco seemed to have won by a landslide, his victory was paper-thin.

"Good grief, I can't blame Major General Farage. Wasn't it 'Draco Lord' Gabil? No wonder he mistook him for Veldora."

Marco muttered, looking at Gabil as he fell to the ground.

At this moment, Gabil's fate seemed to be coming to an end...


![soft scene break]


"Brother!!"

As if to protect Gabil, several shadows came to stand before Marco. It was Souka and the others who had rushed to the scene. And then there were Gabil's subordinates.

"Gabil-sama!!"

"Don't die, Gabil!"

"Aye. Gabil-sama is not a man who should die in a place like this!!"

Even though they knew they could not defeat Marco, they still dared to face him. That courage saved Gabil's life.

Individually, these people were no match for Marco, a 'Saint,' but they were still Special A rank talents. They used healing potions generously, desperately trying to buy some time.

However, Marco's Kondou-inspired technique destroyed the enemy from the inside out with his well-honed fighting aura. Because it nullified the effects of the healing potions, Souka and her subordinates had to be prepared for death.

And then, another one of Gabil's subordinates fell.

Then, Souka's subordinate, Nanso, fell.

Even though there was not that much difference in proficiency, there was too much of a difference in raw power. On top of that, Marco's weapon was legendary-grade. One by one, each of them fell before the inevitable difference in strength.

Fortunately, none of them had died yet. With the evolution of Gabil by Rimuru, the people linked to him had also become stronger. Thanks to this, their endurance had increased, and they were narrowly able to escape fatal injuries.

However, the ongoing damage from Marco's wounds prevented them from returning to the front lines. At this rate, it was only a matter of time before they were all killed.

That's why Gabil shouted, "Enough, that's enough, so get out of here! Souka, that's an order. Take everyone and get out of here!!"

Gabil looked at Souka, desperately trying to rise up. But Souka refused to even look at Gabil and smiled fearlessly.

"I refuse, Brother. I am a subordinate of Souei-sama, so I am not obligated to accept orders from you."

"What are you---"

"Besides! If we run away now, we'll end up with dead people! You, Brother, will die too!!"

Souka, normally a calm person, shouted out with all her might.

"...What are you talking about?!" Gabil was speechless and confused. "Isn't it the role of the commander to reduce casualties as much as possible? Isn't it your job to increase the number of survivors and leave me, who got defeated, behind?"

It was difficult for Gabil to get up right now. He could barely speak his words out loud as he watched his comrades fighting.

However, those words were dismissed by Souka.

"Then my plan is the right one. There are no weaklings among us who can be killed by a single blow. That's why we are going to buy ourselves some time."

Keeping on fighting, unconcerned even if a comrade fell. Battling Marco with numbers and being careful not to cause any casualties. By doing so, Souka and the others were looking for a chance to win.

"This is foolish! There is no guarantee that help will come---"

Now that Rimuru and the rest of the executives were on their way to the Imperial Capital, extra support could not be expected. Even if the other executives who were asleep woke up, they wouldn't be able to conveniently rush over here. The three demon girls they were counting on were dealing with an even more powerful enemy, Velgrynd. They were the ones who needed support; thus, there was no way they could ask for help.

Gabil understood this and had decided that he had no choice but to retreat in this situation. However, it was Gabil's subordinates who disagreed.

"It's you, Gabil! You're the one we're waiting for!"

"That's right, Gabil-sama! You're hurt, so heal up soon and get up!"

"Aye. We will buy time and wait for Gabil-sama's return. That is the only way to save everyone here!!"

Hearing this, Gabil felt ashamed. He wondered if he, alone, had given up on victory.

"...What have I been doing? All right then! Everyone, hold your ground until I get up!!"

Gabil shouted, knowing full well what an absurd order it was. Hot tears spilled from his eyes, eloquently expressing Gabil's feelings. The goddess of victory would not abandon those who did not give up.

Someone responded to Gabil's voice.

"Oh dear, you're as reckless as ever, aren't you? Allow this humble self to help you out here."

"It's an order from my lady; her precious toy, Gabil-dono, is not allowed to die, so I shall go to his aid."

Arriving out of nowhere, Veyron and Zonda, Ultima's subordinates, were standing there.

"Although it would be better for us if you didn't survive," Zonda continued to mutter, but Gabil couldn't hear him over the noise of the battlefield. That was a very lucky thing.

Veyron, looking like a butler, stood beside Souka. He held up his cane to Marco.

"My humble self shall deal with this person, so Souka-dono, please assist me. Zonda here will help with the healing, and the rest of you will take care of the injured."

"Understood!"

"In that case, let's go!!"

Veyron moved as soon as he heard Souka's reply. He was a marquis-level demon peer. His energy ratio was less than a quarter of Marco's, but Veyron's proficiency was superior. Even if he couldn't win, he succeeded in irritating Marco.

"Tsk, just how annoying can you be! You keep coming one after another before I can finish you off."

"Of course. It is our mission to grasp the enemy's strength."

"Yeah. I understand how annoying it is when someone mimics what you're good at. I'll take you down at once and take out that other dangerous---"

"An opening!"

While fighting back against Veyron, Marco turned his murderous intent on Gabil. Not missing a beat, Souka made her move. The shouting was intentional. She was trying to draw Marco's attention to herself and make him hesitate. If she could get her kunai to hit him, it would be all the better. But even if that didn't work out, Veyron's blade would strike Marco. That was her judgment.

Marco saw it coming. That's why he made the best choice. That is, he chose not to avoid Souka's kunai. It was the right thing to do. If he had reacted to Souka, he would have been wounded much worse by Veyron.

Ignoring Souka, Marco continued to flick away Veyron's cane. He regretted thinking of something unnecessary during the battle.

*Tsk, I'll have to finish them off first. They're really such a pain in the ass!*

There was no doubt that Gabil was the most dangerous. That's why Marco had wanted to finish him off quickly, but he became greedy and ended up getting hurt. It was a minor wound, but he couldn't forgive himself for being wounded in the image of his beloved Kondou.

"I'll deal with you first."

"Well now, are you sure you can do it?"

"Veyron-dono, perhaps he's just a sore loser?"

"Hm, I guess so. Well, let's not be impatient and get the job done."

And so, Veyron teamed up with Souka to take on Marco, despite the odds being against them.

![break]

In the meantime, Zonda was not idle either.

"Well, well, this is a nasty technique. Demonic aura---no, he's a human, so it's a fighting aura. He left energy in the enemy's body so that it continued to emit a wavelength that disturbed the magicules. It's a terrifying technique. In this case, it will also work on spiritual life forms like us."

That is how he diagnosed Gabil's injury.

His diagnosis was correct. Like Damrada's 'Spiral Permeation Break,'^[rasen shintō ha] it was a type of energy release, where a condensed fighting aura that destroyed the enemy from within.

This was the essence of the Oboro Shinmei-Ryu---the 'Battlewill'---and the reason why it was called a sword that dispelled evil. That is why magicule healing potions could not heal these wounds.

But Zonda could. He skillfully manipulated the magicules to regulate the disordered energy. He neutralized the fighting aura that Marco had injected and returned Gabil's body to its normal flow of energy. And Gabil did not just sit back and wait for recovery. He yearned for a greater healing power. That desire was about to give Gabil a new power.

However... With the situation still unpredictable, Marco released his stance.

"Oh dear, time has run out. I've been ordered to return, so I believe that ends our battle here."

As soon as he said this, Marco transported away from the scene before anyone could say anything.

Thus, Gabil and the others narrowly escaped death.

![break]


![hard scene break]


Vaughn was struggling against Footman. No, the word 'struggling' was an understatement. Vaughn was also a Sage-class opponent and was confident of his strength. However, Footman had a magicule count that could overwhelm Vaughn easily.

Vaughn's armor and spear were Legendary-grade and contributed to his strength. Even so, it was as if he still couldn't reach him. The only reason why he could still fight was because Footman was not rational. Besides, Phobio's help was also great.

"I, the 'Black Leopard Fang' Phobio, will help you!"

At first, Vaughn was suspicious of the man who had come barging in shouting that, but he soon remembered who the man was.

*The "Black Leopard Fang" is one of Demon Lord Karion's Beastketeers! Right, Karion has now ceded to Demon Lord Milim who is also allied to His Majesty Rimuru.*

Deciding that he was not an enemy, Vaughn welcomed the help.

"Thank you. I was just thinking that this would be difficult to deal with on my own."

"Indeed. Honestly, I don't think I could do it alone either."

Reflecting on his previous attitude, Phobio calmly assessed his own abilities. He knew instinctively that he could not defeat Footman even in his serious, full-strength 'beastialized' state. That is why Phobio chose to fight together with Vaughn, letting go of his pride.

Footman was strong, but his attacks were monotonous because he had lost his sense of reason. Both Vaughn and Phobio were wounded, but barely able to stand. They could not expect victory, but the word "retreat" did not exist in their minds.

Because, right next to them, their comrades were fighting to the death. Responding to the other clown, Teare, was Anrietta, the Head of the Night Assassins of the Armed Nation of Dwargon, and Gobua, who had joined in the war. With a small group of elites, they were trying to capture the lone Teare.

However, Teare appeared to be acting strangely.

"I'm really sorry, okay? This is not my intention either, but it's an order. That's why I'll do my best not to kill you, so please do something to stop me somehow!"

She was talking like that while fighting seriously.

In fact, even though Kagali had ordered Teare to fight, she still had her free will. She could not disobey orders, but she was aware that Kagali was in a state of manipulation. In other words, she was not fighting of her own volition, and did not want to fight at all. That is why Teare was trying to avoid fighting seriously to the utmost extent. Although she joined the battle so as not to violate her orders, she had asked her enemies, Anrietta and the others, to stop her.

In order to respond to Teare's request, Anrietta and the others were carrying out a capture operation. However, the overwhelming difference in strength between the two sides was too great to overcome, and no results had yet been seen.

"That man over there, I'm sorry too, okay? I took advantage of you before, but I'm not going to cheat you this time!"

Phobio was indignant when Teare spoke to him. Footman's sense of reason was taken away to keep them from dying---both Phobio and Vaughn immediately noticed this. He hadn't noticed it when they first met, but the fact that Footman was as powerful as Karion, whom Phobio respects, made him realize that they were no match for him in a proper fight. And for that, Phobio was grateful to Teare for the time being. But:

"Shut up! Don't remind me of my dark history. Even if you didn't say it, I am grateful that you made that man go blindly on a rampage!"

"That's right! You guys are weak, so if Footman was serious, you'd be dead by now!"

In response to Phobio's retort, Teare launched into an innocent tirade. It was obvious that Teare didn't have any bad intentions, and that she meant what she said. That's why it was even more annoying, but for now, complaining was the best he could do.

"What a cheeky brat."

"Shut up already! Rather than that, you'd better work on putting in more effort in restraining yourself!"

Vaughn and Phobio let out a deep sigh, as if to mentally remember this for later.

![break]

The difficult situation continued.

As for Gobua, she wanted to finish up here and help the rest of the battlefield. Because she judged this to be the easiest opponent. However, the situation was not so simple. Teare was not hostile, but she could not disobey orders. Gobua was not wrong in thinking that Teare would be easy to capture. The reason why the strategy did not work was simply because Teare and Footman were too strong.

In the case of Footman, he could easily tear through an iron net. Half-hearted attacks wouldn't work, and it was difficult to knock him out. It took two strong men, Vaughn and Phobio, to hold him back somehow.

As for Teare on the other hand, even Anrietta, who was confident of her speed, could not catch up with her, and Gobua could not even touch her. They had also prepared a cast net for her, but it was unlikely that they would succeed in catching her alive. Souka and the others would have done better, but they seemed to be too busy fighting with Marco.

And so, the war situation worsened.

![break]

With the information from Moss, Gobua was able to grasp the situation of the battle. Veyron and Zonda had apparently gone to Gabil's rescue. The situation had returned to a stalemate, but it seemed to have become that much more dangerous.

Worst of all was Kondou. Hakurou succumbed, and even King Gazel was defeated. It seemed that Agera and Esprit were on their way, but it was doubtful they could even stall for time against Kondou.

<If worse comes to worst, I will come out,> Moss said. His role was to assess the situation on behalf of Benimaru. Gobua was to plan the operation based on Moss's information. Even now, while dealing with Teare, Gobua continued to give precise instructions. This was only possible because of Moss's support. If Moss were to go into battle, the front line would collapse at once.

<Please wait for that. In the worst-case scenario, please do so, but will you be able to manage in the first place?>

<...I'll make it work.>

Gobua felt depressed, wondering if even Moss couldn't win. He was a self-confident man who treated everyone with arrogance except for certain people, most notably Testarossa. That Moss had made such an uncertain statement about doing his best. In other words, it was proof that Kondou was a very dangerous opponent.

Kondou would be difficult to stop.

Gabil had yet to return to the front line.

Gobua and the others were still far from capturing Teare and Footman.

At this rate, it would be impossible to interrupt Kagali's ritual.

There was Gadra, but he was currently engaged in a war of words with Velgrynd. If Velgrynd joined the fight, then defeat was certain.

*This is the worst. I see now how much we've been relying on Rimuru-sama and Benimaru-sama...*

Gobua was in a state of regretful introspection, but even if she realized this now, it was still too late. That is why they must never give up.

*Not yet. The fact that Velgrynd-sama hasn't made a move means that those demons are doing their best. The difference in strength is obvious, but they're still sticking it out. We cannot be the first to give up, that would be unacceptable!*

Gobua was reminded of the three proud demon girls.

They hated to lose, and even though they were newcomers, they were still a part of the"Twelve Chaos Guardian Lords," which was the highest position. To Gobua and the others, they were unimaginably strong, but when their opponent was Velgrynd, the feeling of despair grew stronger.

It was amazing that the battle was still going on.

'I can't lose'---that's what Gobua thought.

Upon regaining her spirit, she redoubled her efforts and resumed the capture of Teare.


![hard scene break]


A man stood before Kondou. It was Agera, who seemed to be a samurai dressed in a casual kimono.

"Go ahead, Agera! I'll stay out of your way."

And with that, Esprit began to heal Gazel and Hakurou. Agera shook his head in disbelief. Esprit was always like that. She conveniently always took the best part. To put it simply, Esprit saw that she could not beat Kondou this time and ran away from the battle. That was Esprit, a demoness who knew how to swim with the tide.

Agera, unconcerned as he always was, pointed his sword at Kondou. He had been undefeated with a single sword for three hundred years. Before Kondou, who had defeated great swordsmen like Hakurou and Gazel, he could feel his blood boiling.

"Kondou, was it? You are a skilled swordsman. I, too, live by the way of the sword. I'd love to have a sword fight with you."

Agera knew he couldn't defeat Kondou without restrictions. It was only because Kondou had agreed to fight with a sword that Hakurou had succeeded to fight back. Otherwise, even if Gazel and Hakurou had challenged him at the same time, they would have been kicked to the ground too quickly to inflict even a single wound.

That was the reason for his proposal. It was a tenuous negotiation, but Agera was confident that Kondou would accept. The reason for this was that Kondou's swordsmanship was somehow familiar to him.

"Agera-dono...is it true that you, too, are a swordsman, like I suspected?"

Before Kondou could answer, Hakurou interrupted with a question.

"Hm? What do you mean by 'suspected'?"

"Oh, no... Actually, I thought that Agera-dono looks like someone I used to know..."

Hakurou stammered in response to Agera's curious look. In fact, Hakurou's grandfather and Agera looked so much alike that they were almost identical. Not only their faces, but also their stature, mannerisms, and even their impeccable behavior was similar.

"Is that so? But unfortunately, I'm afraid I am not the same person. I do not remember meeting you since I was born three hundred years ago. And I do not know if I am a good swordsman, but I am prepared to fight with this sword for the rest of my life."

With that said, Agera smiled gently. For him, the sword was everything.

"I see... Well, please forget the trivial thing that I said."

Hakurou swallowed his various thoughts and withdrew.

Agera must be the reincarnation of his grandfather---he suspected that much, but he had no proof. Besides, even if Agera was Byakuya Araki, it wasn't a reason for Kondou to change his mind. The grandfather whom Hakurou hadn't beaten even once was a human, after all. Whatever the answer, it would not be a factor to turn the situation around in the end. The only way to win this battle was to defeat Kondou by force.

"The person Hakurou-dono knows, by any chance---"

"Yes, it's my grandfather."

Hakurou replied in a whisper to Gazel, who was also whispering.

Esprit joined them in their whispered conversation.

"By the way, did Hakurou-san's grandfather die three hundred years ago?"

"That's right."

"If that's the case, it's possible. He was born a demon in that form, and he had a sword from the very start. Besides, "souls" who are skilled in martial arts gather under Carrera-sama. It wouldn't be surprising if there was such a connection."

"I see. If that is the case, then does it mean he knows some secrets that even Hakurou-dono does not know?"

"It's hard to say. I couldn't master it, but of all the techniques he showed me, he said the Hakkasen was the best..."

And so the conversation went on.

![break]

Hakurou and the others had already been defeated after giving it their all. Therefore, they were ready to wait and see how they would win or lose. Hakurou was worried about Agera's identity, even though he knew that this was not the right time. And Gazel was also curious about Hakurou's master.

Esprit went to treat them. Her appeal to the public that she was doing her job was quite impressive to the point that Agera would tip his hat to her.

Agera gave a deep sigh at the situation. Kondou did not interfere with the conversation enemies and was watching Agera with a relaxed attitude. Kondou's role was to eliminate those who would try to interfere with Kagali's ritual. He was also screening out the strongest people who might be useful, not trying to kill all of his enemies.

That is why he decided to respond to Agera without any haste. The only reason he was serious with Gazel was because it was too dangerous to leave him alone. If Hakurou had entrusted a technique to a 'Saint,' who was evenly matched with him, there was no guarantee that he would win. Therefore, Kondou prioritized victory, that is, he prioritized his work.

He was willing to play around a little if it was against a clearly inferior opponent like Agera. However, it was rare for Kondou to make such a decision. This was because Kondou, who was a pragmatist and a workaholic, disliked waste to the extreme. Kondou's only weakness was his pride in the school of swordsmanship he had studied.

*Goodness, I'm still a little naive that I cannot let go of my personal feelings.*

He reflected on this but could not suppress his curiosity.

'Fine, I'll play along,' Kondou was about to say, but he was not so foolish as to lose sight of his surroundings. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Velgrynd move.

Kagali's taboo ritual, 'Birthday,' was still in progress, but it looked like the situation had changed. Unfortunately, there was no time, and Kondou decided to move out as well.

"Sorry. I would have liked to keep you company, but work comes first."

After speaking to Agera, he put away his sword. His attitude was completely condescending to Agera. But even knowing this, Agera could not stop Kondou.

As he watched Kondou walk away, he couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.

"It looks like I narrowly escaped death," he muttered in frustration.


![hard scene break]


Gadra was struggling in a lone battle against Velgrynd. But that didn't mean he was actually fighting. Such an attempt would have shattered even the technologically advanced Demon Colossus with a single blow.

Gadra knew his place and would not have done such a foolish thing. He was questioning Velgrynd out of his own curiosity.

"I had no idea that Her Excellency the Marshal was the sister of Veldora-sama, the Scorch Dragon Velgrynd-sama. I never knew that until now. It's no wonder you're so beautiful."

First was a word of flattery. In this way, he attracted Velgrynd's attention.

"It's only recently that I showed my face, so it's only natural that you didn't know me."

And that was the end of it.

Velgrynd stayed and continued to converse with Gadra. It was his best strategy to buy time with conversation. It worked, and Gadra was still alive even now. However, Velgrynd had her own agenda.

"---Oh, I see. So Velgrynd-sama has been supporting His Majesty Rudra all this time. I, Gadra, am truly impressed that you've been able to play the role of Marshal for generations!"

"There was a time when I didn't speak for a few hundred years. It's not so hard to play the role."

Velgrynd responded politely, but her face showed signs of fatigue. She was fed up with all the questions Gadra was asking her. That's why she couldn't help saying something that sounded like a complaint.

"Even so, you've got a lot of nerves. I allowed you to ask questions because you're Rudra's favorite, but I didn't expect you to keep asking so many."

"I'm flattered by the compliment!"

"No, it's not a compliment."

Velgrynd looked dumbfounded. It would be easy for her to twist and crush Gadra. However, she had already taken out four Split Bodies, and was hesitant to release them just to take out Gadra. As long as he did not interfere with the ritual, she was fine with that and could deal with Gadra.

In contrast to Velgrynd, who was wondering if she had made a mistake, Gadra asked a series of lively questions.

"By the way, I was wondering, why did Damrada-dono stop me from informing His Majesty? If Rimuru-sama's forces had been properly disclosed, the Imperial Army would have suffered less damage."

"Well, as you've probably figured out by now, we don't care about the Imperial Guards. We just let the war happen to awaken the stronger ones."

"Even so, wouldn't it have been better to hear the story from me?"

"How persistent. I know you want to say Damrada has betrayed us, but he has his own reasons."

"Hmm, I see. So, what do these reasons have to do with the boy Masayuki?"

"I don't know. Why would I need to know what Damrada is up to? Who's Masayuki, anyway?"

"Huh?"

Gadra was puzzled by Velgrynd's reaction. By his estimation, Masayuki was the key.

"Ah, I don't suppose you know the Hero Masayuki?"

Gadra asked fearfully to which Velgrynd replied without hesitation.

"I told you I don't know him, or is he someone strong?"

When asked if he was strong, Gadra could only say no. Gadra did not dislike Masayuki, and was even fond of him, but he knew that the boy was not strong.

Hearing Gadra's reply, Velgrynd snickered. "Kondou is only interested in those who are likely to awaken. Besides, if you call yourself a Hero, there will always be causal effects, so you would think the demon lords would come to you and take care of you anyway, right?"

'I see,' Gadra thought. Yuuki used Masayuki to see Demon Lord Rimuru's reaction. And it was undoubtedly at Damrada's suggestion. In other words, the upper echelons of the Empire must have known about Masayuki. And yet, Velgrynd was saying that she didn't know. Certainly, it would be understandable if she ignored him because he was not a powerful person. At least for Kondou, he would have judged Masayuki to be worthless. He would have tried to nip any uncertainty in the bud, and if Masayuki was the spitting image of Emperor Rudra, it would not be surprising that he would have tried to get rid of him.

He could understand Kondou's thinking, but what he could not understand was Damrada's actions.

"Hmm. But Damrada-dono had two Single Digit guards to protect the boy, didn't he?"

"To infiltrate the land of monsters, no?"

"No, that's true, but..." Feeling frustrated, Gadra trailed off.

It sounded reasonable somehow, but there was something off about it. From Gadra's point of view, as someone who had betrayed the Empire, he was worried about something that he should not need to worry about.

Gadra wanted to yell at Velgrynd to take him more seriously.

"You seem quite dissatisfied."

"Uh, no, no, no. It's nothing."

Gadra tried desperately to calm his shaken heart, wondering how she could detect his state of mind when she couldn't even see his face.

Then, he suddenly understood the reason why he felt at odds with Velgrynd's words.

"Damrada-dono is really a traitor, isn't he?" Master Gadra blurted out.

"Don't be silly. You're the traitor."

It was a fair point. But Gadra was not daunted. Making the most of his nerves, he spoke up against Velgrynd.

"In any case, let me ask you something. This boy, Masayuki, is actually the spitting image of His Majesty Rudra. What do you think about that?"

That's right, it was Masayuki's appearance that made him feel uncomfortable. Whether one was strong or weak, it was natural that the empire placed importance on that. In the case of Masayuki, the more important information, which should have not been left unshared, was that he was the spitting image of the ruler, Emperor Rudra. It was possible that Kondou knew this information. However, Bernie and Jiwu would not have known.

Damrada, Rudra's friend, knew about it. So why did he decide to protect Masayuki? That is what he couldn't understand, Gadra thought.

"...What did you say?"

"As I've said, His Majesty Rudra and the Hero Masayuki have the same face. Why would this information---?!"

In the middle of his explanation, Gadra paled and closed his mouth. He shuddered at Velgrynd's expression and, regretting that he had gotten carried away, couldn't help thinking, *Oh, perhaps I'm going to die...*

But Velgrynd ignored Gadra and began to ponder. It was unlikely that Kondou was unaware of this information. If so, then she wondered why he didn't tell her.

The more problematic issue was Damrada. She didn't know what he was thinking and could no longer ignore Gadra's words. More than that, to what extent were they similar---

*How similar is he to Rudra? I'll have to confirm it myself...*

She had thought everything was going according to plan, despite the minor mistake regarding the invading Imperial forces being annihilated. And yet, that seemingly insignificant piece of information irked Velgrynd to no end.

"Gadra, thank you for the useful information. I'll let you off the hook for that information, so what do you say? Do you want to challenge me with that toy of yours?"

Velgrynd had no intention of killing Gadra in the first place. For all appearances, Gadra was one of the few friends Rudra trusted. And while it was true that Gadra had betrayed the Empire, Velgrynd believed that he did not betray Rudra. To Velgrynd, the Empire itself was of no importance. Therefore, Gadra's betrayal was still acceptable to her. In this respect, Velgrynd's thought process was a little different from others and was not something Gadra could guess. That is why he decided that he had no choice but to go along with Velgrynd's proposal.

Because he could not win anyway, he chose to argue to buy time. If they were to have a real battle here, the mission would be over at that point. To put it simply, Gadra would be eliminated in less than a second.

So Gadra did not hesitate.

"Whahahahaha, you've got to be joking. I'm well aware that I'm no match for you!"

He needed to be shameless here, and so he just laughed it off.

In this answer, he pretended to be denying the proposal, yet he did not answer either yes or no. He left the decision to his opponent, so there was no fear that he would be accused of running away from Rimuru's side later. It was the perfect way to get by. This was Gadra's cleverness at its finest.

Velgrynd was aware of Gadra's craftiness, but all she could think of was that he was a funny guy. She let out a sigh and let it slide as something that was all too typical of him.

Besides, luckily for Gadra, things had changed.

The 'Split Body' that was fighting Veldora had gotten serious, and it became necessary to leave.

"Oh, really? Let me know when you're ready. I'll deal with you then. But before that, do your best to survive this war."

"---Eh?"

"I have some business to attend to, so I've decided to leave this to another pawn. You seem to have been hated by the military, so do your best to become a 'Saint.'"

"What do you mean by---"

Velgrynd hovered in the air, ignoring Gadra's attempt to question her. The interruption to the magic would cause a significant delay to the ritual, but it was unavoidable.

Gadra, who was left behind, looked up at Velgrynd, stunned. He was confused by the change in the situation and was at a loss as to what to do.

On the battlefield, there was no time to relax your mind, not even for a moment. As if to prove this, the meaning of Velgrynd's words became clear even before Gadra could give an answer---

![break]

"Spacetime Connection!!"

![break]

---It was an astonishingly unrealistic scene.

As soon as Velgrynd, who was floating in midair, shouted, the space became greatly distorted. And from there, countless flying ships appeared.

"That, is that the fleet of flying ships responsible for carrying the Magic Beast Corps?! N-no way...are you saying that she connected the space? No, no, no, that's impossible. How far is it from here---no, no, that's not even the point!!"

Gadra was confused. The reality of what was happening before his eyes was just that unbelievable. The flying fleet that was supposed to attack the Kingdom of Ingracia from the north had been summoned, ignoring both time and space. Even by Rimuru's calculations, it should have taken them more than three days, and Gadra believed it to be impossible to summon them.

Magical transference was fraught with great danger, and if done poorly, it could kill the soldiers. To prevent this, a larger amount of mana would be needed, and the technique would become more complicated.

*No, it is possible for Rimuru-sama. However, if you want to call someone who is at a different coordinate, the difficulty rises by an order of magnitude! This kind of thing should be impossible, but...*

It was just too insane. Gadra could see the correct answer, but he could not accept it as reality.


![hard scene break]


At the very moment when Gadra was confused, there were others who felt the same way. A fleet of airships heading north to the Kingdom of Ingracia were enjoying a smooth flight. Unlike the dangerous sea route, the sky was safe. This was because there were few, if any, monsters that could fly to high altitudes.

In command of the 300 flying ships was Major General Zamud, the chief executive officer. Zamud's mission was to transport allied troops. He was to transport 30,000 members of the Magic Beast Corps, led by General Gladium, to the Central Continent. Since they were not fighting themselves, it was easy.

However, there was one section of the luxurious flagship where Zamud was boarding that was wrapped in a strange atmosphere. He had been told that an important person was inspecting, but he had not been told who it was. It was a sudden interruption, and at worst, it's possible that Army Commander Calgurio might not even know about it.

Nevertheless, Zamud did not care.

*Fufufu, it's better not to know. It'll only shorten my life if I pry too much.*

He was completely focused on his work. That's why he was able to spend his time relaxing, but then Zamud received an urgent message.

"Excuse me!"

It was the officer acting as the messenger who came into the bridge with an uncanny appearance. The fact that he had come by himself instead of leaving it to the soldiers meant that he had something important to report.

Zamud grinned and asked the officer, "What happened? Did you receive a call from our home country?"

Actually, they had already received reports that the Army Commander Calgurio had suffered a crushing defeat. Most of the ground forces had been lost, but that was none of Zamud's business. Once an operation was underway, it could not be stopped until it was ordered to be aborted. As the battlefield was still a few days away from here, there was no point in Zamud panicking. In fact, he was even hoping that the order to abort the mission would be issued soon.

He had not informed the soldiers, but if word got out, it would affect their morale, and the success rate of the operation would drop, and he believed it would be safer to start over. Zamud could not make this decision on his own because some people would consider it a weakness.

General Gladium, the general of the allied forces, was such a type of person, and someone Zamud was not very good with. Therefore, Zamud hoped that the report would be an order to abort.

However, a situation that Zamud could never have imagined occurred.

"H-Her Excellency, the Marshal, is here!!"

"Wh-what?!"

Zamud couldn't help but scream back.

Considering that he didn't even know she was on board, Zamud's surprise was not strange.

*S-so the important person was Her Excellency the Marshal! No way... Are you saying this mission was that important?!*

Of course, it was definitely important. However, because one of the three major armies was moving, there should have been no need for the Marshal. No, right now, the first thing to do was to think about how to deal with the Marshal.

"All rise! We shall welcome Her Excellency!!"

Zamud, who had recovered quickly, gave the order. The sluggish air was blown away, and the bridge became tense. Immediately after everyone had stood up and bowed, the door was opened. Velgrynd, the stunning beauty, appeared. The people on the bridge were in awe at the sight of Velgrynd's beauty. The Marshal, who had never appeared before, was now standing in front of them. Velgrynd's beauty had captivated them before their brains could even register the fact.

Velgrynd, on the other hand, took it as a matter of course.

"Foolish ones. Don't just stand there, get back to work," she pointed out gently.

But she mustn't get careless. Velgrynd was a rational being and understood that if she rampaged here, she would destroy the flagship. This was Velgrynd's concern, as the main body of Emperor Rudra was on board. The people who were present were lucky.

"Be seated! Everyone, get back to work."

Following Zamud's orders, the officers returned to their work.

Thus, the elegant cruise had come to an end.

![break]

What followed was a series of surprises for Zamud.

"It's a great honor to meet you. My name is Zamud. I hope to leave a lasting impression."

"Yes. I'll consider it if you survive."

"That is a great honor. I will remember those words and work hard."

"As much as I'd like to encourage you, there's no time. Let's get down to business."

Velgrynd brushed aside Zamud's sycophancy and sat down in the captain's chair.

She turned to Zamud, who stood beside her in a panic, and gave him an order.

"I can't be bothered to explain things more than once, so call Commander Gladium."

"Yes ma'am!"

Zamud signaled with his eyes, and the officer who understood his intention connected the monitor to the ship Gladium was on.

In less than a few minutes, Gladium appeared on the screen.

<Well, you are even more beautiful than I imagined.>

Gladium looked at Velgrynd and thought it would be easy to subdue her. So there was some doubt in his mind.

*Why? Why is a woman like her considered to be stronger than me?*

Her body is supple and soft, with no excess fat or muscle. No matter how one looked at it, she seemed to have nothing to do with strength. Some people thought that the important thing was mana or fighting aura, but one still needed a strong body to circulate those energies.

*Just like mine*, Gladium was proud of his own body. That's why Velgrynd looked so weak to him. He was the essence of muscle-brain functioning.

As for Velgrynd, she didn't think anything of Gladium. His strength was real, and she intended to use him to the fullest as a useful pawn.

Velgrynd simply returned the words, "Enough with the flattery," and then gave her orders without hesitation. Velgrynd's attitude was as if she did not care about Gladium at all.

"As of this moment, the operation in progress is canceled. The new mission is to conquer the Armed Nation of Dwargon. That is all. Are there any questions?"

Zamud and Gladium thought to themselves 'is it finally time?' They had expected the order to be delayed this long because of the unprecedented turmoil in their homeland. If they had suffered a major defeat, it was necessary to review their operations immediately. Since they were conducting a three-front operation simultaneously, that decision would be of even greater importance.

A single failure could cause everything to collapse. However, several days later, they were ordered to call everything off, just before arriving at the Kingdom of Ingracia. The two were understandably dismayed.

"Understood. Then let us return at maximum speed."

<Hmph! If that is Your Excellency's order, then I, Gladium, will answer with my life. However, please understand that we will hold you accountable later for your late decision and the failure of the mission.>

Zamud tensed, but Gladium responded with arrogance.

Gladium, who was on a different ship, was unaware of Velgrynd's commanding aura because he was looking through the screen. Zamud watched Gladium's response with deep apprehension.

*Don't drag me into this!*

Zamud prayed internally.

Velgrynd, however, was having none of it.

"Looks like you've got it all wrong."

She smiled and began to explain.

"A misunderstanding, huh?"

<About what? Are you saying that you're not at fault?>

*Yes*, nodded Velgrynd, then she began to explain.

"First, Zamud. I will take you from here to your destination. After that, I will continue to give you instructions, so keep that in mind."

"Huh?"

"Secondly, Gladium. The mission hasn't failed, and this is exactly what we planned to do from the start."

<Don't be foolish! At this point, do you really think you can escape responsibility like that?>

"Foolish?"

Velgrynd narrowed her eyes in displeasure and glared at Gladium. *What a pain*, she thought, and wondered what to do about him. She concluded to just leave it be. Gladium was indeed strong, but he was no match for Velgrynd. He could easily be destroyed, but it seemed a shame to do so. And above all, there was no time.

This turned out to be a tremendous stroke of luck for Gladium.

"Well, whatever. If you survive, we can talk about this at length."

<What are you--->

"Listen. I'm about to make a 'Spacetime Connection,' so move quickly. After that, I'll focus on Veldora. That kid's a lot tougher than I thought. It's a nice miscalculation, but it's going to be a bit of a handful. Therefore, you'll take over for me and take control of the battlefield. We've identified several promising candidates, so take them in alive if you can. Understood?"

Ignoring Gladium, who was still about to complain, Velgrynd got down to business. Having said all that, Velgrynd turned her back on them. Then, she put her hand on the reinforced door to get from the bridge to the outer deck.

"Your Excellency! Your Excellency Marshal, what are you doing? It's not safe, please come back!!"

"What? I told you already. If I don't go outside, I can't make a 'Spacetime Connection.'"

Velgrynd glanced at Zamud as if he was a fool and opened the door without hesitation. And just like that, she flew into the sky.

*How selfish! Are you going to drag us into this?!*

Zamud was terrified. Opening the door while flying at high altitude and high speed was an unbelievably dangerous act. If they got unlucky, the people inside the ship could be sucked out by the difference in air pressure. Zamud, something of a scientist himself, was an ordinary person and not a soldier who had undergone the augmentation operation. The low temperature would deprive him of his physical strength, and he might die of oxygen deprivation. The same was true for the mages under his command.

Zamud was impatient to close the door quickly. But his fears were unfounded. Velgrynd had performed a 'Spatial Domination' and prevented it from affecting the ship.

Not long after his surprise from that, the biggest shock of all hit Zamud---no, not just Zamud, but all of the officers.

In a flash, Velgrynd floated into the sky. And the next moment:

![break]

"Spacetime Connection!!"

![break]

A huge distortion of space appeared before Velgrynd.

"This is absurd..."

"I can't believe it. Spatial oscillation confirmed. It seems that the huge, overpowered magicule fluctuation is affecting space-time!"

"N-no...could that be the work of Her Excellency the Marshal...?!"

It was indeed absurd. After all, it was a phenomenon beyond human comprehension and beyond human imagination. There was no way to understand what was going on, there was no way anyone could do something like that---everybody was escaping from reality.

But then, Zamud noticed something.

"'That kid'...? Did the Marshal just call Veldora 'that kid'?"

There were only a few people he could think of who could call Veldora that.

*Could it be?! Then this person's true identity...I'm afraid to say...*

The guardian dragon of the Empire, a dragon too sacred to even name. Zamud had thought that the Empire was protected by its whims, but now he realized that the truth was something else entirely. As if to confirm Zamud's prediction, Velgrynd's smile deepened in the sky.

"Now, go quickly and be of use to me."

No one would be able to disobey that voice.

Not only Zamud, but even Gladium, as if lured by the sweet voice, turned the bow of the airship and headed for the spacetime rift.


![hard scene break]


With Velgrynd's action, the state of the war had changed dramatically. The same was true for the three demon girls who were still fighting fiercely.

A serious Velgrynd was an unimaginable tyrant. There was no chance against her. With her overwhelming strength, she toyed with the three ladies, not even allowing them to touch her. She was serious and not holding back. Even a mere blow of magic was incredibly powerful. In an attempt to annihilate the three, Velgrynd continued to attack with all the strength she had. She was like a berserker without reason. There was no doubt that this was definitely Velgrynd's full power, without transforming to her dragon form.

However, Testarossa and the others were still alive. If it was before they had been named by Rimuru, they would have lost their bodies and been sent back to the demon world. However, the orichalcum body made by Rimuru had been strengthened by their primordial mana.

As a result, they were able to withstand Velgrynd's rampage, albeit barely.

"I'm really surprised. I was going to finish this much sooner. You're tougher than I thought, and used to close combat."

These were Velgrynd's true feelings. She hadn't expected this to take so long even when she was using her full strength.

"Ufufufu, we will not be defeated," Testarossa assured her. "Diablo would ridicule us if we behaved so disgracefully. That would be more humiliating than death."

"I agree. That guy is so malicious," Ultima added.

"I'm sure Diablo would say you are the last person he wants to hear that from. Well, but I do agree that he's malicious," Carrera said.

Despite being on the ground and with wounds all over their bodies, the three girls' eyes were not resigned. On the contrary, they were still smiling fearlessly.

Their attitude exemplified the concept that as long as you didn't concede defeat, you were not defeated.

"Oh dear, how troublesome."

Velgrynd couldn't help but feel confused, but the battle was already decisive. The troublesome Demon Lord Rimuru and his officers had been captured in the Fortress of Dreams, and Veldora had been successfully dragged out of the labyrinth. The only thing left to do was to take control of Veldora as planned.

With this in mind, Velgrynd turned a deaf ear to the light-hearted talk of the three demon girls, but when Testarossa stood up and said something, her expression became distorted.

"It took a while, but I've figured out the characteristics of this 'Parallel Existence'."

Their goal was not to defeat Velgrynd, but to stop her here. That was the tactical victory condition, but it was made impossible by Velgrynd's 'Parallel Existence' subterfuge.

That is why Testarossa had been looking for a way to at least break it.

"Let's hear it, shall we?" Velgrynd said.

"Very well then."

Testarossa smiled graciously even though she was being beaten up.

Velgrynd thought that Testarossa's attitude was admirable, even though she was an enemy. That's why she was willing to listen to her. Testarossa pointed out that Velgrynd's 'Parallel Existence' was not invincible but had its limits. There was a limit to the number of Split Bodies she could produce, and if they were defeated, she would not be left unharmed.

"To be precise, the physical damage would be zero, I suppose. But for spiritual lifeforms like us, energy consumption is the damage. In other words---"

"Our attacks were not in vain!"

Ultima concluded, taking away Testarossa's words.

Testarossa nodded, smiling. However, her eyes were not smiling, they were looking at Velgrynd.

Velgrynd sighed inwardly. This was why she didn't want to deal with the Primordials, she thought. Testarossa had hit the nail on the head. In such a short time, and in the midst of being hopelessly overrun, Testarossa was able to analyze the situation. Even Velgrynd had to admit that it was an astonishing sense of combat.

"As expected of Blanc---no, it was Testarossa. You're correct, I will give you that."

She'd love to take them for herself without killing them, Velgrynd thought. Resentment served no use, because even if she killed them, they would be revived someday. They might not be like a certain demon lord she knew, but Velgrynd found it extremely troublesome to be stuck with a primordial.

Carrera, unaware of Velgrynd's feelings, laughed fearlessly.

"Kukuku, you've shown too much leeway, Velgrynd-sama. Veldora-sama would not be *sandbagging* against us."

Velgrynd was annoyed by Carrera's comment. Incidentally, what Carrera meant by "sandbagging" was "looking down on your opponent and cutting corners." Naturally, Veldora was well aware of the danger of Testarossa and the others. In order to maintain his dignity, he would never show his weaknesses. It turned out to be misunderstood in a good way, but Velgrynd was not amused when she heard Carrera's comment.

That's right, she should not be amused. And yet, Velgrynd found herself feeling happy for some reason. As an older sister, she was pleased with the growth of her little brother, who had always been a troublesome child.

Perhaps because of this, she lost her fighting spirit. It was just the right time, too.

After fighting with Veldora, she realized that his strength was not what it used to be. Velgrynd was going to get hurt if she didn't give her all.

After careful consideration, Velgrynd decided to stop the battle at this point. She decided to let go of Testarossa and the others whom she could kill in an instant if she really wanted to.

"You're right. Indeed, he seems to have grown up quite a bit. I'm happy to see that, but I'm afraid I can't go easy on him. Therefore, I've decided to leave you guys here for now."

Velgrynd unilaterally proclaimed.

Velgrynd's 'Split Body' disappeared before the surprised three demon girls. It was only for a moment, and all they could do was watch.


![hard scene break]


The forest was on fire. Velgrynd extinguished the Split Bodies she had released all over the place and united them. Then, after emitting a dazzling red light, she transformed into her Dragon Mode cloaked in a crimson aura. In the aftermath, the trees had gone up in flames.

Veldora had also reverted to his dragon form, and his dominating aura had caused a storm to rage.

The flames flickered, casting light upon Veldora and Velgrynd. The battle between them was now in full swing---

![break]

Velgrynd returned to her true form for the first time in a long time and looked at Veldora. Veldora also exposed his massive frame as if to show off his enormous magicule pool.

It had been a long time since the two siblings had seen one another in these forms. The encounter between Velgrynd and Emperor Rudra had taken place a long time ago. By the time Veldora was rampaging across the land, Velgrynd was already lurking in the empire. She had never left Rudra's side, not even to casually go outside. It was due to this feeling of inconvenience that she had devised the 'Split Body' ability, which she only learned after Veldora had been sealed away.

The last time they had met was on a continent to the southwest over 2,000 years ago. At that time, as she recalled, Velgrynd had only shown a glimpse of her power for fun, and Veldora had fled immediately. But the impact had still been enormous. The energy generated by the collision of the True Dragons had even created a volcanic zone. It is said that volcanoes were still active on that continent to this day.

*Hmm...It seems that the seal did not weaken him after all. On the contrary, he seems to have grown stronger than ever.*

Truly, Velgrynd thought it was a happy miscalculation indeed. Her brother's growth was honestly gratifying. The problem was that he would disobey Velgrynd, but that was something that could be solved with strength. Even if she failed, Rudra's power could still be relied on.

*As long as Rudra's power is at his disposal, he can control even the True Dragons. As proof of that, even I...I was...eh? Just now, what was I thinking about---*

Velgrynd felt as if she was on the verge of remembering something very important, but her thoughts suddenly wandered wildly. Instead, she changed her mindset and decided that her first priority would be to capture Veldora.

While she wanted to avoid relying on Rudra as much as possible, she still needed to take away Veldora's resistance in case that did happen. To lighten Rudra's burden as much as possible, even if only a little.

*Rudra is already at his limit, so I need to make things easier for him.*

Those were Velgrynd's true feelings. Therefore, as much as possible, she wanted to tame Veldora without relying on Rudra. There was no other reason. There should be no other reason.

Velgrynd had a chance to win. The amount of magicules Veldora possessed was vast, but he lacked the ability to properly utilize them. That was why Velgrynd did not consider Veldora to be that dangerous. She thought that his earlier attack was brilliant, but it was only because he was in control of his power that he was able to fight her.

If Veldora were to use his full strength, he would not be able to control his power well and would only be able to attack with brute force. No matter how massive one's power was, it was meaningless if they could not use it.

*I'll have to teach him a few things once he joins us.*

Although he was still a trump card in the game, Velgrynd intended to train Veldora to the point where he could compete with Velzard. But for now, she was going to take advantage of Veldora's inexperience and end this battle at once.

*This will shift the game board in one breath.*

The end of the long-running game was near. The victory of Velgrynd and Emperor Rudra felt close at hand. The first step was to capture Veldora. With Veldora's cooperation, they would then have a chance to win the game. They would finish the long game in one fell swoop. And then, Rudra would be free.

With that in mind, Velgrynd slowly began her flight towards Veldora.

![break]

The battle was supernaturally fierce from the very first move.

Velgrynd was the first to make a move. Without being wary of a counterattack, she unleashed 'Burning Breath.' The ray of light extending from the dragon's mouth was a thin, converging, ultra-high temperature heat ray. Its intense power attacked Veldora at a nightmarish speed, several dozen times the speed of sound.

Veldora avoided it. Normally, Veldora would not take damage from the flames due to his 'Heat Nullification.' Yet Veldora rushed to avoid the heat ray.

"Oh, I didn't think you'd choose to avoid that one. You're an idiot, that's why I thought I would be able to end it in one move like the old days. You have finally become able to see the true nature of a technique."

"Kuahahaha! Sister's breath attack has an 'Accelerated Destruction' effect, doesn't it? If I take a direct hit, my mana will go haywire. If that happens, I'd lose the power to control it. It's only natural to avoid it," Veldora replied with a laugh.

Indeed, Velgrynd's attack had a special effect. It was the ultimate power of 'Accelerated Destruction.' Due to this power, which could speed up all events, could increase a destructive effect. Not only that, but it also accelerated the life activity of the target. Even spiritual life forms could not resist this power. Even if one could avoid simple destruction, their energy would spiral out of control.

Veldora sensed this intuitively and chose to evade it. This was also proved by the result of 'Analyze and Assess' by Veldora's Ultimate Skill 'Investigation King Faust'. That is why Veldora answered his sister Velgrynd with confidence.

"Oh...I didn't know you could see that far. I'm pleased to see you've really grown up."

Veldora's correct answer gave Velgrynd a sense of crisis. She realized that she was no longer facing a rampaging fool, but an opponent who should be evaluated properly. He saw through her own powers accurately. That meant that Veldora also possessed an Ultimate Skill.

A 'True Dragon's' attacks were powerful enough to reach the ultimate level, but when managed along with an Ultimate Skill, the danger level increased astronomically.

Velgrynd was delighted. She celebrated the growth of her bungling little brother. But at the same time, she was vigilant. Rudra's plans could fall apart now that Veldora grew to the point where he could threaten her. At this rate, they would not only have difficulty controlling Veldora, but she might even be defeated. She hadn't expected this level of growth.

Velgrynd was upset at the thought, and then Veldora made a move against her.

"Are you thinking about other things on the battlefield, Sister? That's called being careless!"

As he said this, he unleashed 'Thunderstorm'. It was Veldora's sure-kill technique, an attack with overlapping storm magic.

The attack hit Velgrynd directly---however, the force was scattered and did not cause much damage.

"I see. It seems that you really have acquired an Ultimate Skill. I commend you from the bottom of my heart, Veldora!"

"You're still a terrifying person, Sister. You deliberately took the attack just to confirm it."

"It's not like I have other choices, right? I needed to measure the threat level of your power."

"So, does my Ultimate Skill 'Investigation King Faust' pass?"

"It seems to be an analytical type of Ultimate Skill. It doesn't appear to add any extra attack power, but the accuracy correction is excellent. Your mana control has improved thanks to your 'Investigation King Faust' ability, hasn't it?"

"Kuahahaha! That's right. My magicule amount is greater than yours, Sister, so there's no need for more power. As long as my attack hits, that's all that matters," Veldora boasted.

"You're smarter than I thought you'd be," she replied with a smile. "You certainly have something that I do not. That's why I want to add you as a trump card."

"Hm?! When my sister praises me, my back feels all itchy..."

Veldora replied playfully, but he also noticed that the atmosphere around Velgrynd had changed.

In other words:

"Fufu, you should be rewarded for that. I'll show you just what I am capable of."

"Uh, there's no need---"

"I will deal with you using the full power of my Ultimate Skill, 'Charity King Raguel'!!"

Veldora's voice did not reach Velgrynd.

It would be outrageous to lose by cutting corners. Even after the fierce exchanges, neither of them had sustained much damage. That is why Velgrynd decided to give her all against Veldora. She was sure that Veldora would not die.

A myriad of magic circles appeared around Velgrynd. It was a simultaneous activation of magic by a partial 'Split Body'.

"Eat this!"

Eleven light rays---Nuclear Attack Magic: Nuclear Canon attacked Veldora. After a moment's judgment, Veldora decided to neutralize the magic with a magic barrier. There were too many rays to evade. Besided, he thought it was just simple magic and planned to just ignore it, which caused him to be a bit late in responding.

Veldora had put up a magic barrier because he sensed the danger of Velgrynd's 'Nuclear Cannon.'

"Gyabaa!"

Veldora felt searing pain.

He had failed to neutralize Velgrynd's magic, and he had been hit.

"Oh, you really have gotten clever, haven't you? I'm a little surprised that you only took that much damage."

"Gununununu, I didn't think that even magic could be granted the power of an Ultimate Skill as well... If I had taken it head-on, I would not have been able to escape unscathed."

"As for me, I was planning to finish you off, so you can be proud of that."

"Kuahahaha, I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I must decline. I'll be proud of myself once I defeat you!"

In return, Veldora activated his Storm Magic: 'Tempest Ruin.' He mimicked Velgrynd's move by imbuing his attack with the effect of his Ultimate Skill. The attack succeeded in blowing Velgrynd away.

"Kuahahaha! What do you think, Sister? If you've learned your lesson, then we can make peace and end this here---"

"Don't you dare make a fool out of me! It seems that you've made me angry."

"Eh?! No, wait a---"

Velgrynd snapped, no longer asking questions. Veldora's attack had damaged her. The moment Velgrynd realized that, her sense of reason was blown away.

In an attempt to regain her pride as an older sister, Velgrynd launched her next attack. Ten heads appeared and unleashed eleven rays of 'Burning Breath' at Veldora. At the same time, she shifted space and positioned herself above Veldora.

Veldora, who was avoiding the simultaneous attacks of multiple breath attacks, found himself in a disadvantageous position. He found himself confronting Velgrynd from below, looking upwards. He couldn't help but feel impressed with her maneuver. At the same time, it made him happy that he could sense Velgrynd's seriousness.

*Kuahahaha! I was no match for her in the past, but now I am able to fight like this. This is all thanks to my training with Rimuru.*

He was so happy. Despite this, he understood that he was in danger. He thought about how to escape.

Velgrynd, on the other hand, was pleased to have Veldora in her kill-zone. She was certain that this was the perfect position and that she would not let Veldora escape.

"Let's end this, Veldora. After all, you cannot escape from my hands!" Velgrynd declared, raining 'Burning Breaths' down from above.

The scorching rain poured down incessantly, connecting heaven and earth as a pillar of flame. Seen from the outside, it looked like a cage of flame.

In the midst of all this, Veldora anxiously danced back and forth. He was not playing around at all and was looking ahead to anticipate every attack, evading each one. It was still a very fast attack, but Veldora felt that it was not so fast that he could be overwhelmed. Trusting his instincts, he sent his massive frame flying. As a result, even though he was surrounded by the flame cage, he did not take a single direct hit.

"Kuahahaha! It's nothing if it doesn't hit me!" Veldora happily shouted a line he had learned from the scriptures (manga).

Velgrynd, on the other hand, clicked her tongue in annoyance. It was certainly a miscalculation on Velgrynd's part not to get a single shot. There was no doubt that she had underestimated Veldora.

But:

*This is where my attack begins!*

Her absolute advantage was still intact. Velgrynd decided to show her secret move.

"It is indeed admirable to have seen through my attacks to such an extent. As a reward, I will send you a searing hug! 'Burning Embrace'!!"

Velgrynd's positioning above Veldora was significant. Below was the earth, boiling with burning lava from the 'Burning Breath' that Veldora had avoided. Even the splattering drops held a terrifying amount of heat.

What would happen if more attacks were added to that burning hell?

"H-hold on, Sister?!"

It was too late to panic any longer when sensing that intention. Veldora had been caught in Velgrynd's trap from the start. Velgrynd's excessive attack caused the ground to boil and gasify. The super-heated lava enveloped Veldora's surroundings. That is the tiny droplets that contained Velgrynd's power---'Bloody Lava'---pouring from bottom to top.

The 'Cardinal Cage' used to hold Veldora captive was now complete.


![soft scene break]


The essence of Velgrynd's Ultimate Skill 'Charity King Raguel' was "charity"---in other words, "support." The true value of this Skill was the "increase in effect (enhancement)," and for Velgrynd, whose nature was "acceleration," this was the most synergistic ability.

So, what would happen if Velgrynd applied her power to the 'Cardinal Cage'? The momentum of the object would increase greatly, and the heat would also be amplified to the maximum. It was no wonder that the 'Bloody Lava' turned to gas, reaching tens of thousands of degrees rather than 2,000 degrees. This was how the scorching prison was created, but its true potential lay beyond that.

Velgrynd's support effect could be increased to any extent without limit. In other words, a moderate amount of support will have a positive effect, but an excessive amount will be a burden. The *negative* effect could even accelerate the exhaustion of the subject's stamina. It was also possible to increase the effect to the point of burning the target to death with the heat its body generated.

In other words, the true ability of the Ultimate Skill 'Charity King Raguel'---it was the power to manipulate all energies at will.

![break]

As if embracing Veldora, the red rain created a delicate coating. Those trapped in the 'Burning Embrace' must surrender their right to life and death to Velgrynd. Even if the target was a True Dragon, the result would be the same. Once trapped in the cage, there was no escape.

Velgrynd was convinced of her victory and was about to make her final offer to Veldora---but then she paused.

There was no sign of Veldora, whom she should have captured.

*What's going on?!*

Velgrynd was in a rare state of impatience.

At this point, she felt a presence behind her and turned around in a panic.

"Kuahahahaha! Didn't I tell you that before? It's nothing if it doesn't hit me!"

Trumpeting his victory was the human-form Veldora. His high, loud laughter was extraordinarily piercing to Velgrynd's ears. It was only then that Velgrynd truly recognized Veldora as a threat.

![break]

And Veldora as well. Although he was laughing confidently, he did not have that much to spare. Veldora had been angry because his clothes had been burned, but once he cooled down, he realized that there was a big difference in ability between him and his sister. He recognized that there was little chance of victory even if he fought seriously, and so he went on the defensive around halfway through their fight.

This was the very strategy of Hinata. While taking care not to receive fatal wounds on herself, she would devise attacks based on the gaps in her opponent's defense. Then, when she determined the most effective move, she would unleash a barrage of attacks when she found the right time to strike.

In the battle with Hinata, it seems that she had seen through his own habits. When they fought at the 100th level, he had overwhelmed her with his strength, but once she time-leaped, he was beaten by her in the form of the Hero Chronoa.

*Well, it's no wonder. Even though it was supposed to be our first fight, she knew all my moves and habits. I knew something was wrong!*

It was cheating---Veldora thought so, but saying so would only make him sound like a sore loser. Just remembering Hinata's smug face was annoying, but a loss was still a loss. Veldora honestly reflected on himself and learned how to fight a superior opponent from that experience.

Not only that, but he learned cunning through the mock battles with the demons. Even if you couldn't win with your own strength, you could win by being less exhausted than your opponent. That was the type of battle between spiritual beings, and Veldora had learned it.

It was a perspective he had never held before. By observing Rimuru's way of life, an interest in all sorts of things emerged. The naturally inquisitive Veldora's horizons were opened up and he learned to think in ways that he had never done before. This seemed to have a positive effect and played a role in Veldora's growth. This was now being demonstrated in the battle against Velgrynd. Veldora was practicing the art of fighting without losing, wherein Velgrynd activated the 'Burning Embrace'.

The 'Cardinal Cage' was a sure-kill technique. Once the target was captured, Velgrynd's victory was assured.

Veldora had been too busy avoiding the 'Burning Breath' to see that it was a trap. However, the 'Predict Danger' of his Ultimate Skill 'Investigation King Faust' was activated. He always activated it in order to not be caught off guard in any situation. It worked and saved Veldora from his crisis.

After receiving a maximum warning he had never felt before, Veldora knew that something was wrong. He was convinced by the terrifying chill that if he continued to escape, he would lose. However, there was no way to figure out what was going on, even if he rushed to deal with it.

Just then, the 'Bloody Lava' erupted in the air. Seeing this, Veldora saw through Velgrynd's true thoughts. But at that stage, it was still difficult to deal with. It was obvious that this was not something that could be blown away by his 'Ruin Tempest'.

The area was already under the influence of Velgrynd's 'Spatial Domination', and it was impossible to escape with 'Spatial Transportation'.

*Oh crap!*

But at that moment, the 'Investigation of Truth' of 'Investigation King Faust' came up with the optimal solution. It was dangerous to touch the 'Bloody Lava,' because Velgrynd's will also resided in it. It was not easy to escape from that mist-like substance. However, even if it was impossible for a massive body, it was possible for a human form. Although he would have to give up his defenses, he could see a future where he could escape through that gap.

But even so, the chance of success was 50 percent. If he timed it correctly, he would be fine, but if he failed, he would be taken out in one shot. Veldora was in doubt, but then he had a revelation that would definitely lead to success.

He didn't realize that the 'Probability Manipulation' of his 'Investigation King Faust' had been activated. Surprisingly, the 'Probability Manipulation' was a power that allowed him to manipulate events to his own advantage against opponents of equal or lower rank.

Veldora was also surprised by this. In other words, the probability of success was doubled. In this case, it was as if his escape, which had only a 50 percent chance of success, was guaranteed to succeed. *How convenient was that?* Veldora was skeptical, but he reverted to his human form and attempted to escape from the cage. He succeeded in doing so.

And just like that, Veldora escaped from his crisis.


![soft scene break]


Velgrynd threw away her composure and glared at the laughing Veldora. She wondered just when Veldora had grown up so much, when she had initially thought her brother was inferior to her.

It was a terrible misunderstanding that he was nothing but a violent brute who let his strength run amok. Veldora had brilliantly mastered an Ultimate Skill, which could rival even Velgrynd. And amazingly, he had managed to escape from a situation that should have been absolutely impossible to reverse.

It might have been extremely presumptuous of her to try and teach Veldora a lesson. She had no choice but to admit it. Veldora was on the same level as herself. Velgrynd recognized Veldora and confronted him as an equal or greater enemy.

If she analyzed the situation calmly, Velgrynd was at a disadvantage. It was because her special move had just been defeated. Superficial attacks would be evaded, and it would be difficult to inflict a fatal wound. In that case, she had no choice but to rely on Rudra's 'Regalia Dominion' after wearing Veldora down.

With that in mind, Velgrynd decided to change her tactics and act cautiously.

"Oh? It seems my sister has acknowledged me as well."

Perhaps noticing Velgrynd's intention, Veldora returned to his dragon form and spoke casually.

Velgrynd found it amusing even though it should have been irritating.

*Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever played with this kid before...*

She was thinking of such things.

With a smile on her face, Velgrynd replied.

"Well, yes, you're right. I will admit it. You are now able to hold your own. That's why, Veldora, if you're going against me on your own terms, I will not tolerate it."

Velgrynd declared, as if speaking to herself.

Seeing his sister's change of mood, Veldora felt threatened. But he couldn't just nod in acceptance here.

"Kuahahaha! In that case, I will also give it my all to deal with you!"

Veldora was finally getting used to his Ultimate Skill, which he had not used much until now. He had been having a tough time against his sister, Velgrynd, but with this power, he felt that he could still compete.

And so, Veldora decided that it was his turn to take action. Although he could not use 'Parallel Existence' as Velgrynd had done, Veldora also had a sure-kill technique up his sleeve. The name of the technique, which he told only to Rimuru, was 'Storm Blast.' He had come up with this after consulting with him, and once he learned it, Rimuru had praised him.

*Even Rimuru was impressed. There's no way it wouldn't work on my sister!!*

Veldora was very confident. As far as Veldora knew, there was no one more cunning and tricky than Rimuru. He had always thought to himself that he was lucky to have Rimuru as an ally. And this technique had Rimuru's seal of approval.

Now, without hesitation, Veldora unleashed the 'Storm Blast.' From Veldora's mouth, a 'Thunderstorm' was unleashed. Its fury interfered with space, and invisible rays of light flew about haphazardly.

Naturally, Velgrynd would only deal with attacks that were extremely dangerous. To begin with, she did not care about the interference waves as it would have no effect on her.

But that was the trap. When multiple types of seemingly meaningless waves crossed with one another, they generated an unexpected destructive force. Similar to sonic weapons, they did not pose a threat on their own, but by the time you noticed them all, it was too late.

Velgrynd was no exception, having overlooked the 'Storm Blast.' It was only through the pain that pierced her entire body that he realized she had fallen into Veldora's trap.

"Guuhh?! I'm feeling pain...what? Veldora, just now, what did you do?!"

"Kuahahaha! It's the special technique I invented. It's called 'Storm Blast,' and I'm quite proud of it," Veldora boasted smugly.

He was elated that he had hit the target. Although he understood that this was not a fatal blow, he had never had such an advantage over his sister before. That was why Veldora couldn't help but want to brag. But:

"You really are foolish, you know. You still need to improve upon that."

Veldora writhed in a fierce pain that he had never felt before.

It was Velgrynd who triumphed. As soon as Velgrynd had acknowledged Veldora, she had given up on the duel. There was no point in winning or losing, and she focused only on the success of the mission. That is why she had secretly brought in the emperor's flagship without Veldora's knowledge.

Aboard the flagship was Lieutenant Kondou, who was fully prepared. As instructed by Velgrynd with her 'telepathy', Kondou unleashed his most powerful attack against Veldora.

And then:

A blow that could destroy even a deity. The bullet, which Kondou could only fire once a day, was called 'Judgment.' This was the ultimate blow, firing the most powerful bullet created by the Ultimate Skill 'Conviction King Sandalphon' with his Nambu pistol that had been elevated to the mythical-level.

It was far more powerful than the 'Necrosis,' and as far as Kondou knew, no one had ever been hit by it and remained unscathed. It was capable of burying even Velgrynd's Split Body, and no matter how great Veldora was, he would not remain unharmed.

Everything was as Velgrynd had calculated. The bullet's initial speed was close to the speed of light, and it could penetrate any 'defense barrier' to reach its target.

The careless Veldora had no room left to resist the 'Judgment.' He was pierced by the bullet, and even his own existence was jeopardized as a consequence.

![break]

Veldora couldn't believe it.

*Did my sister actually get help from a third party?!*

Veldora had been overjoyed at the prospect of beating his sister. It seemed that her sister exploited this moment and made him fall for her trick.

But even so, he was surprised that his sister, a prideful woman, had abandoned the duel against him. He understood that she was giving priority to the victory condition, but that was very unlike her.

As important as that was, the more problematic issue was his current situation.

*Not good! That man...That must be the guy Rimuru was wary of. It was just one blow, and I can't move!!*

In Veldora's brain, a warning was ringing at full force. It was abnormal for Veldora, a spiritual life form, to feel pain and suffering.

The most powerful 'True Dragon' race was now in a life crisis. It was understandable that Veldora was anxious in the face of this unbelievable fact.

If it had been a head-on strike, he might have been able to resist the attack even if he could not avoid it. However, now that he had been hit by complete surprise, there was nothing Veldora could do.

*Ouch, this is not good. It's better to just accept the defeat this time and get revenge the next time we meet. Kuahahaha. Now then, I'll contact Rimuru---*

Despite the situation, Veldora had plenty of room to spare. It was because he knew that he and Rimuru were connected by a Soul Corridor and he could be resurrected. As long as Rimuru was alive, Veldora was immortal. Therefore, there was no need to panic.

However, things began to take a turn for the worse for Veldora.

"Regalia Dominion."

He had been so focused on Kondou that he hadn't noticed, but there was another man standing on the airship, dressed in luxurious clothes.

*...Masayuki? No, it's not. Mm? W-wait a minute! What is this? This is bad, this is really bad!!*

By the time he realized what was happening, it was too late.

That man---Emperor Rudra, was about to take over Veldora's mind. The 'Judgment' bullet had made him severely hurt. It was all over for Veldora. However, there was one thing that Veldora couldn't stand.

*...It's fine if it's just me. But if this continues, my sworn friend Rimuru will be harmed. That's the only thing I can't forgive!!*

Rudra's control was more powerful than he had imagined. It was obvious that if he left things as is, it would affect even Rimuru through the Soul Corridor.

That was unforgivable, Veldora thought. Therefore, he cut off the Soul Corridor of his own volition.

"Th-This is fine. I'll leave the rest to you, Rimuru..."

With those last words, Veldora's consciousness plunged into darkness.
