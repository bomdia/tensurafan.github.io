# Chapter 3: The Intensifying|Battlefield

The 30,000 members of the Magic Beast Corps, led by General Gladium, flew into the sky from the airship.

Seeing the gallant figure of Velgrynd, their morale was high. The enemies below them would make the perfect targets for their violent impulses.

"Listen up, men! His Majesty and Velgrynd-sama will see what you do here. You must perform well, so bring out your fighting spirit and don't act like fools!" Gladium shouted, and his soldiers responded with an air-shaking roar.

Gladium was pleased with that. This was the perfect opportunity, he thought while smiling inwardly.

*Kukuku. Even if I give up on taking over the world, there is no doubt that my time will come. Calgurio has been defeated and that Yuuki kid has fallen. I am the only one left, leaving me as the only general. As long as I make my military mark here, I will get what I want!*

From Gladium's perspective, the Western Nations were not much of an enemy. Hinata Sakaguchi seemed to be a formidable opponent, but Gladium only saw her as a half-wit who could only come to a draw with a new demon lord.

Gladium was a confident, aggressive fighter.

.........

......

...

He was the second most powerful man in the Empire, the "Beast King" Gladium. His origins, as the rumor had it, were in the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania. In fact, Gladium was the half-brother of the "Beast Master" Karion.

The beast that dwelled within Gladium was a solitary white tiger. He had a history of being too selfish and was judged unworthy to be a king.

*Those scum!! They aren't even in the position to be in the same room as me, yet they dare side with Karion and plot a rebellion against me. I'll make sure to get my revenge.*

Gladium had been harboring hatred for many years. It had turned into outright resentment by this point. The previous king of Eurazania was not a great warrior, but he had a good eye for people. He had made his decision based on his discernment of which of the two brothers was more worthy to lead Eurazania's people.

Upon hearing his decision, Gladium was furious. He had attempted to subjugate the former king, and although he succeeded in killing his own father, he was later banished by Karion and the Beastketeers of the time.

The rebellion was nothing more than Gladium's selfish belief, but the truth was quite the opposite. The fact that Gladium had survived was proof of his strength. He was a heretic of the beastmen tribe, and if his character had been decent, he could have become a mighty warrior capable of defeating Karion.

But that was just an assumption. Gladium had fled and wandered around the world. The people he met while doing so were now the three generals who were currently Gladium's loyal subordinates.

![break]

"Suzaku (Vermillion Bird)" Nazim. She was a mutant of the harpy tribe that Gladium had met while wandering near the Winged Nation Fulbrosia. Her wings were gray with purple spots, and there were three pairs. In return for her loss of reproductive ability, she possessed outstanding fighting power. Gladium took a liking to her beauty, which was similar to Frey's, and brought her into his group.

"Seiryuu (Azure Dragon)" Baraga. Baraga's partner was a Water Dragon, an archdragon who had been defeated by Gladium. He was a warrior in his prime, and his ability was in the middle of the ranks of the Imperial Knights.

"Genbu (Black Tortoise)" Gozarin.^[Including Gladium's representation of the Byakko (White Tiger); Suzaku/Vermillion Bird (Nazim), Seiryuu/Azure Dragon (Baraga) and Genbu/Black Tortoise (Gozarin) all make up the Four Divine Guardians of Chinese mythology. Just a fun fact for those who weren't already aware. Also, "Seiryuu" is used multiple times in this volume for both Baraga, and some other weapons (like the one Velgrynd uses). I will use the term "Azure" dragon when referring to things related to Baraga/his weapon because that is the most widely accepted name of the Chinese divine guardian. But for the other things I will use the term "Blue" dragon which is still a correct/common translation.] A girl with a rare monster, Lorelei^[Based on the legend of the siren, the Lorelei (Loreley) is a tall cliff in the bend of the German river Rhine, responsible for many sunken ships.]. She was a priestess of a foreign race and was skilled in various magic arts. After Gladium had defeated Lorelei, she began to follow him.

The three generals had different stories, but they all had one thing in common---they were strong. Nazim, for example, was a Demon Lord Seed and could be awakened at any moment. Baraga and Gozarin's monsters were also Calamity-class and had outstanding strength among the 'Magic Beast Corps'.

![break]

It was about three hundred years ago that Gladium had taken refuge in the Empire. It happened after Veldora had been sealed away. He had survived the Tenma Great War and idiotically led his violent group in a rampage through the Empire's territory. He was defeated by the Imperial Army and pardoned for his strength by promising to obey Emperor Rudra.

Gladium's ambition was to defeat the Marshal and become number one in the Empire. Then, once the opportunity presented itself, he would rebel against Rudra and take his place. Gladium had no auspicious intentions to repay the favor given to him. He only followed the other party because they were strong, and he was vigilantly waiting for an opportunity to betray them at any moment.

With the help of the Empire, he would rule the world. And one day, he would reign as the emperor himself. It was a reckless dream, for he did not know just who the "Marshal" was.

Rudra and the others had long been aware of Gladium's true nature. But as long as he was strong enough to be useful and obeyed orders, it was fine to keep him alive. The dangerous balance of mutual exploitation was made possible when the intentions of both parties were balanced.

And now, that balance had fallen apart.

*No way. I never thought that the "Marshal" would be the Scorch Dragon Velgrynd. It's impossible to defeat that kind of existence. It's a terrifying existence that is far beyond my reach at this moment.*

It was truly an existence of a different dimension. It was a stroke of luck that he realized this before his rebellion to kill the emperor. Gladium thanked the god he didn't even believe in.

.........

......

...

Gladium had changed his mindset. He knew that if he wanted to become emperor, Velgrynd was someone he must defeat at some point, but it would require careful preparation. Understanding this, he would devote himself to earning credit for his achievements for the time being.

Besides, this was a good situation for them. Gladium's bestial instincts told him that he was close to awakening. He knew intuitively that he was almost ready to gain great power.

The same was true for Nazim, who had always fought with him. Although the conditions for the awakening were not clear, the time was near. This was one of the reasons why Gladium had sought out the battlefield.

And now, in front of Gladium, there was the perfect crowd of fodder. How could he not be pleased with this situation? Gladium licked his lips. Looking around the battlefield, there were many enemies who seemed to have great power. The more of them they defeated, the more powerful Gladium's group would become.

"Kukukuku, the party is about to begin!"

As Gladium had hoped---no, wished with all this heart---the battlefield would soon become more intense.


![hard scene break]


The three generals under Gladium's command moved in accordance with their lord's purpose. Their gazes sought and found powerful opponents.

"Hey, hey, that's King Gazel. If I defeat him, that will do wonders for my reputation."

"What, are you trying to get ahead of everyone? If you don't leave something good for Gladium-sama, he'll be pissed, you know?"

King Gazel's bravery was widely known, and defeating him would certainly put him in a good light. As a warrior, Baraga's heart was racing. Nazim was the one who calmed him down. He knew that Gladium was targeting King Gazel and advised Baraga to make concessions.

Besides:

*If he defeats Gazel, Gladium-sama's power will surely increase. This is too good a situation to pass up!*

This was also Nazim's true feelings.

As for Baraga, his main priority was also Gladium, his master. In the first place, Gazel was a wounded man and there was a risk of being accused of cowardice as a warrior. In this way, it would be best to take out a more appropriate enemy.

"I understand. I hope that Gladium-sama will devour King Gazel and become stronger," Baraga said.

"Kishishishi. Rest assured," Gozarin said with a smile. "There are many other powerful opponents here. It's a little unsatisfactory, but it may be enough to fill your stomach."

As was said, there were many strong people on the battlefield.

Baraga nodded, not in a hurry. Nazim also smiled and agreed.

"Ufufu. As Gladium-sama says, the time of awakening is near. The first one to become a True Demon Lord will be me. The 'Vermillion Bird' Nazim!"

"Nazim-dono, aren't you the one who's trying to get ahead?"

"Well, calm down now. I'm sure we're all thinking the same thing. Let's leave that King Gazel to Gladium-sama, and we will do as we please!"

Those words spoke for everyone's feelings.

"In that case, I'll take that weak lizard. He seems to be the leader of the dragonewt group who still seem to be very active and troublesome, so I'd like to strike him first to crush their fighting spirit."

"Then I guess I'll go with the cocky woman over there. I'll have to teach her a lesson about flying in the air without my permission."

"Kishishishi. Then I will destroy that golem. I'll let him taste the full power of Lorelei!"

One by one, the three generals made their declarations so that no one's prey was snatched. Then the three generals flew towards their respective prey. However, this shallow plan would prove to be na√Øve.

![break]

Gladium's target was Gazel, as his three generals had predicted. It was only natural. Whether or not to target the strong first depended on the situation, but it was common sense to first deal with a strong foe who had been weakened. Gazel could not move because he had been hit by Kondou. Now was the best chance.

"You must be King Gazel. My name is Gladium. General Gladium, commander of the Empire's most powerful Magic Beast Corps! I shall take your head!"

There was no hesitation or humility, it was just downright low. But this behavior was justified for Gladium. It was his sincere conviction that one should use any means necessary to achieve your goal. And so, Gladium swooped down towards King Gazel, but someone stood in his way. It was a dragonewt with reddish-purple scales that sparked with purple lightning---the "Draco Lord" Gabil, who he thought had been defeated.

"Gwahahaha! I am back!! Your disrespect for King Gazel shall not be overlooked."

"Tsk, so you dare to interfere with me? Damn lizard."

Gladium was displeased to have been disrupted by his prey. However, he soon got flustered, realizing that this was not the time to be thinking that.

As Gladium looked over at his three generals, wondering what they were doing, he was met with a startling sight. The "Azure Dragon" Baraga, who was supposed to be Gabil's opponent, had been defeated in a single blow from the recovered Gabil. The "Black Tortoise" Gozarin, who had headed for the Demon Colossus with high spirits, was in tears after Lorelei had been crushed. The only one left was "Vermillion Bird" Nazim, who was fighting on equal terms with Souka, whom she had identified as an enemy.

Even when the soldiers had challenged Gabil in order to defend Gladium, the difference in their strengths was obvious.

There was no choice, so Gladium tried to move forward himself.

At that moment, however, Major General Zamud sent an urgent "Magic Communication."

<I-it's an emergency! Demon Lord Rimuru has committed an outrageous act over here. In order to ensure His Majesty's protection, please send reinforcements to us immediately!>

Gladium was tempted to yell at him, but he managed to swallow his words. Then he inquired what had happened.

<He drew a huge, a-an impossibly huge, Demon Summoning Gate...>

<What are you saying?!>

<In other words, hundreds of greater demons and above were summoned! Moreover, they've been incarnated. Their individual strengths are all above A rank, yet they're even acting as an organized group!!>

From Zamud's flustered exclamation, he could tell that this was a serious situation. However, Gladium was not convinced. Demon Lord Rimuru may have done something ridiculous, but the Empire still had Velgrynd. She could not be defeated by any demon, and he didn't think this was that much of a threat.

If they were talking about threats, Gladium would rather concentrate his forces on the one in front of him.

<Our side is also in the middle of something. I want you to take care of your own affairs.>

Spitting out the words, Gladium tried to end the call. However, Zamud's urgent voice stopped him.

<But you must understand, there's a demon army of catastrophic scale that exceeds the strength of the Imperial Army's generals and soldiers!!>

<What are you talking about? You have not only Velgrynd-sama, but also the Imperial Guard on your side!!>

Even though there was only one flagship, the people on board were the Empire's most powerful battle force. Gladium believed that they could do whatever they wanted on their own, without having to rely on him.

It was only natural to think so, and no one would blame Gladium for it. But this time, the opponent was just too strong.

<It is true that we have Lieutenant Kondou and the Imperial Guard here. But we have our hands full dealing with the demon lord's army executives.>

<The executives?!>

'It can't be'---was the thought that crossed Gladium's mind.

As for the identity of the opponent in front of him, he knew he was an executive by the name of Gabil, though it was a rough guess. That said, he had been surprised by the strength of the opponent, but now that he thought about it, he realized that there had been other executives named in the report.

Benimaru, Shion, Diablo, Gobta. They were called the Four Heavenly Kings of Demon Lord Rimuru, yet Gabil's name was not listed among them. If that was the case, it meant that the Four Heavenly Kings were more powerful than Gabil.

<That's not all! Believe it or not, Demon Lord Rimuru has committed an abomination we could not have imagined. I don't know how he did it, but he evolved the demons!! Do you understand? Hundreds of demons have been enhanced to be as strong as archdemons!!>

It was certainly an unrealistic story.

Gladium didn't want to believe it, but Major General Zamud was not a man who would joke about these things. On the contrary, he was a serious, meticulous person. In that case, it was true, and he had no choice but to believe that hundreds of Calamity-class enemies had been unleashed.

<I see. Zamud, I understand your concerns.>

<Ahh, then I'm counting on you for reinforcements!>

With a sigh of relief, Zamud's call was cut off.

Gladium pondered.

Even if they had greater numbers, it was meaningless if they were outclassed in quality. That was the rule of the battlefield, and it was why Gladium had trained his subordinates so much.

If it was only the demons, they might still be able to get by. But now that two of the three generals had fallen, it was dangerous to think so optimistically. At the very least, Gladium's subordinates would just be waiting to be overrun.

*Tsk! Have I underestimated him as a mere demon lord and misjudged him? I and the upper echelons of the empire will survive, but the lowly soldiers will all be slaughtered in the end. In that case, I'd rather...*

It was too late for regrets. All he could do now was do what was within his power. And Gladium had a forbidden trick up his sleeve.


![soft scene break]


The members of the Magic Beast Corps were elites, selected and trained by Gladium. They were of the bloodline of champions from the olden days and were a group of innately powerful people---That's what was said, but the truth was something else. They were a group of artificial champions, created by combining magic and knowledge of another world.

The magic beasts they tamed also had their own secrets. Not only were they selected to be of A-minus rank or higher, but by rewriting the information in their genes, they had been given abilities specialized for combat. A synthetic life form created by cultivating and increasing the number of magic beasts and integrating various characteristics into them. It was a kind of weapon called the Battle Chimera.

Gladium, a beastman, was also the director of these studies. He made the mechanism of his own transformation known and used it to strengthen his subordinates.

In this world, there was no such thing as research that was forbidden for ethical or religious reasons. Because of this, results were achieved at an astonishing rate. As a result of human experimentation using slaves, the strongest army that Gladium wanted was born. The A-ranked champions and their partners, the 'Battle Chimeras', were a fusion of man and monster, and boasted unparalleled strength. However, their true value had yet to be demonstrated...

The integration of different natures---that was Gladium's ultimate goal. For this purpose, a special prescription technique (Medical Skill), 'The Beast,' was developed. The existence of this drug, which was the most important of his military secrets, was known only to Gladium's three generals.

It was a wonder, and the effects were the culmination of all of the resources he had sunk into the experiment. It was a fusion of the magic beasts and the soldiers.

Based on the transformation of the beastmen race, 'The Beast' sought the beast factor not from one's own body, but from one's partner, the Battle Chimera. In the truest sense of the word, the human and the beast fused, and a tremendous power developed in the body. It could create a super-warrior incomparable to any magic beast tamer.

However, as it was a forbidden drug that gave people the power of magic beasts, it was also very dangerous. Once the drug was administered, the Skill would be activated forcibly, and it was impossible to remove it on your own. It was only possible to remove the drug at the hospital attached to the institute.

There were also serious side effects that should not be forgotten. Rather, the side effects were the real problem, as the safety of the drug was not guaranteed. According to the current research results, the mortality rate was 40 percent. In some cases, the user would fail to adapt and would not be able to return from the magic beast. There was a 20 percent chance of this happening, in which case the person would never be able to live a human life again.

Worse than this, however, was the chance of going berserk. Some users were turned into magic beasts and went on a rampage, while others lost consciousness and disobeyed orders while maintaining their human form. When this happened, there was no choice but to dispose of them. There was also a 30 percent chance that this would happen. It was worse than dying, so it was not an easy thing to try. Those were the cases of complete failure.

In total, there was a 90 percent chance of failure. Taking the drug was tantamount to ordering someone to die, and even the selfish Gladium was hesitant to test this on his own people.

Gladium wanted to improve the quality of the drug and increase the success rate before letting his subordinates use it. However, that was not an option under these circumstances. At this rate, the weak would all be killed anyway.

Emperor Rudra was an even more cold-hearted man than Gladium. There was a part of him that believed the weak were nothing more than bait for the strong. If that was the case, letting them use the drug here was the only way to show them compassion.

Besides, those who would go berserk could be used as bait, and even if they could not return to human form, they were still valuable as a fighting force. The only real waste would be the 40 percent of soldiers who would die on the spot...

The outcome was uncertain, but there was no doubt that their forces would become more powerful than they were currently. In that case, it was the right thing to do. There were still many unknown factors about the effects of the drug, and physical abnormalities that might occur, but it was certain that 10 percent of the soldiers would become stronger.

On the battlefield, quality was more important than quantity. For those who knew this, the idea of strengthening 10 percent of the soldiers was a tempting one. In reality, the total success rate remained unknown. The number of trials was too small, and there was a risk of unexpected side effects due to physical abnormalities. Although such a possibility could not be ruled out, some of them had been able to harness the power of magic beasts and survive.

The most successful of those who lived---less than 1 percent---had been confirmed to be fully compatible. They were hailed as Chimera Knights and the story about that success was---

"Hey, you guys. I just got a call from Zamud. Apparently, this is no longer a good time to play around. Get up quickly and take care of them."

Gladium spoke very seriously.

"Hmm?"

Gabil's face turned suspicious as he realized the words were not directed at him. However, he immediately tightened his expression and jumped away from his spot.

A moment later, a silver light pierced the area where he had just been.

"Hmph, you dodged that one. I thought it was a perfect surprise attack, but it seems that you are still an opponent not to be trifled with."

"Not to be trifled with? That's my line. How are you still in one piece after I put a big hole in your chest?"

Gabil jumped back and was confronted by the supposedly dead "Azure Dragon" Baraga. There was still a hole in his chest, and there was no sign of 'Ultraspeed Regeneration' or even 'Auto Regeneration'.

A normal person would be dead by now, but this was a world full of dangerous majins. There was nothing too strange about what was happening. Gabil understood this, and he had made sure that the life-signs of his defeated opponents were gone. It was Baraga who was abnormal.

"Kukuku. I am safe because Gladium-sama has given me great power. Let me show you who I really am!"

As if in response to Baraga's cry, a Water Dragon flew in. No! It was similar but not the same thing. It was a Battle Chimera that mimicked a water dragon. Baraga was one of the Chimera Knights who had awakened to his true power. If either his main body or his partner was safe, then he was safe. This was also one of the hidden powers of the Chimera Knights. And now, by activating the special Medical Skill 'The Beast,' he was able to recover from his fatal wound in an instant.

Furthermore, as soon as Baraga and the water dragon came into contact with each other, they merged their bodies into one. Baraga's form remained unchanged, but dragon's scales appeared on his body.

The quality of his youki was different from before. There was no doubt that his strength had also increased substantially.

Gabil glanced at Gladium in frustration, but decided that Baraga was now his enemy. He tried to focus on a single battle with Baraga...but Gladium was not so na√Øve as to allow that.

"This lizard is stronger than expected. We'll kill him together."

"Yes. I'll take the vanguard. Gladium-sama, please provide support."

"Very well. I'll help you, so don't skimp out!"

Neither honor nor chivalry were of any concern to Gladium. Having recognized Gabil's power, he would move to eliminate him without a second thought.

"What nonsense! Even if the two of you come at me together, you won't be able to beat me!!"

Gabil made a bold statement, inspiring himself.

And so, he faced a disadvantageous battle.


![soft scene break]


On another note, the other two of Gladium's three generals were also opponents to be wary of. Just as Baraga was safe, so was Lorelei---the one who had supposedly been crushed by the Demon Colossus.

Gadra had been monitoring the battlefield in sync with the Demon Colossus. Therefore, he felt uncomfortable when he heard Gladium's words.

*Get up quickly, he said? Just who was he talking to?*

While he was thinking about this, he noticed that Baraga was back on his feet. He hurriedly tried to alert Gabil, but before he could do so, he felt a chill run down his spine and turned around. Standing there, he realized, was a girl whose appearance had changed dramatically. No, calling her a girl might not be correct either... She had the form of a girl, but her skin was metallic and reddish-black. Her body was not of flesh and blood, but rather of rock that had been transformed into magisteel. It was like a polished mirror, and it was obvious at a glance that this was not a human.

"You...have you assimilated with Lorelei?"

"Kishishishi, that's right. As expected of the wise Gadra-dono. You are well versed in otherworldly knowledge, but our approach is a bit different."

"Hmm, I see. That's interesting."

"Yes, I'm sure. I will show all its power to you, so let me know what you think!"

A girl with an evil smile---"Black Tortoise" Gozarin laughed at Gadra as if to incite him. Then she took a step forward.

As for Gadra, he would prefer to not toss around his old bones in a fight again.

He thought that he had defeated Lorelei with brute force, but it seems that it was just an act. Realizing this, Gadra revised his estimation of Gozarin's strength.

*Good grief. Is this genetic engineering? The nature of monsters has many mysteries, and I thought it would have little meaning in this world of magic...but was it the other way around? I'm impressed that they've achieved so much in the quest to assimilate with monsters.*

Gadra was quite impressed.

There were many different kinds of monsters, and some of them did not have genes in the first place. It was believed that it would be too difficult to produce results because there was not enough time to solve all the different cases.

That is why, in the Empire, genetic engineering was only studied in the field of medicine. At least that was supposed to be the case, but it seems that within the Magic Beast Corps, research was being carried out in secret. It was easy to assume that the content of the research was inhumane and could not be disclosed to the public.

Gadra was not a moral person himself, so he could understand the feeling of wanting to prioritize one's own intellectual curiosity first. That's why he wasn't going to complain, but he still regretted not being able to participate in the research. Because of that, it was unclear how much his opponent had been strengthened.

From the looks of it, Gozarin's power surpassed that of Demon Lord Clayman's. She seemed to be less powerful than Sare who was a 'Saint', but she still appeared to have almost as many magicules as Sare. In terms of the Dungeon's Elite Ten, she surpassed even the pre-awakened Zegion. The amount of magicules was not equal to one's strength, but she was definitely a dangerous opponent.

"The Dragon Lords would be no match for you. It seems that I'll have to take you on seriously."

"It's an honor to be recognized by a Master Gadra. Now, have a taste of this power!"

Gozarin took action. Her forward thrust was heavier than a 10-ton dump truck hitting him at over 300 km/h. Even the Demon Colossus, which was just over 3 meters tall and weighed more than 30-tons, was easily blown back.

Gadra adjusted his stance unhurriedly and shouted, "Purple Thunder!!"

As the name implied, a purple electric shock was unleashed. It was a one-million-volt discharge, one of the armaments installed in the Demon Colossus. Incidentally, just because the voltage was high did not necessarily mean that the power was high, and the weapon had been implemented just because it looked cool. It wasn't worth more than it looked like, but it was the best way to scare adventurers. And it also managed to get through to Gozarin.

"Wh-what the hell?! It's not magic? You can manipulate lightning strikes without activating mana---"

Rather than because of its power, she froze out of surprise.

"Well, yes. It's a secret weapon after all. Rimuru-sama had faith in me and entrusted me with this. Therefore, defeat must not be allowed!"

Gadra was also enthusiastic. He had analyzed Gozarin's thrusts and found that her body structure had been replaced by magisteel components. His guess was that it was Lorelei's special ability. Although the material was heavier and harder than steel, Gozarin's movements were smooth. Moreover, her hidden power was comparable to that of a 'saint', and there was no choice but to admit that it was a despicable transformation.

However, Gadra had the Demon Colossus.

"Take this, the ultimate magical weapon---Demonic Buster!!"

Once again, it was the most powerful weapon in his arsenal. Because the fire control system was linked to Gadra's will, the weapon could be activated without any time lag. The 'Demonic Buster' was the strongest of his weapons. It was a name that respected the demons, following the style of Gadra the magic geek. Its performance could be described as a magicule convergence gun. It converged and launched not only the magicules from the mana furnace within the Demon Colossus, but also the magicules in the surrounding atmosphere. One-shot kill was the best term used to describe this weapon.

The chest of the Demon Colossus opened up, revealing Gadra's figure through the transparent membrane. From the center of the palms of his hands, a ray of light was emitted. It was the focal point of the magicule-gathering destructive ray.

"Tsk!! As expected of the former commander of the Magic Corps," Gozarin said.

She seemed to have chosen defense instead of evasion, and her expression was very stiff.

"Flush it out! 'Magisteel Ultra-Fine Vibration Wave.'"

Minute fluctuations begin to ripple across the surface of Gozarin's body. It was a specific vibration emitted by the magisteel. This frequency of the magisteel was unique in that it could create waves that bounced back magicules. This was the reason why Gadra's magic did not work; by assimilating with Lorelei, Gozarin was able to freely manipulate this property.

The convergence of magicules and the diffusion of magicules. Those two opposing forces collided. The winner was Gozarin.

"---What?!"

"Kishi, kishishishi! I survived. The victory is mine!!" Gozarin shouted with joy.

Gadra was a wizard. Naturally, this meant that he relied on magic for his attacks. Gozarin's body, on the other hand, was made of magisteel, which gave her an absolute advantage over magic. Both of them were aware of this. That's why Gadra had used the most powerful weapon in his arsenal. If this did not work, then it could be said that Gadra had virtually no way to defeat Gozarin.

"What a headache. I didn't expect her to defend it..."

Gadra was considered a powerful person. He had defeated opponents with more magicules than himself. Even against a saint like Sare, he had overwhelmed him with the difference in skill-level.

However, there was one type of enemy that was inexplicably incompatible with him. It was an opponent against whom none of his attacks could work. If he could not defeat them, then he could not win, even if he did not lose. Gadra understood that he was at a disadvantage in this battle. He wondered what he should do.

*This is a critical moment, I suppose. I am an outsider, and Rimuru-sama does not fully trust me. If I fail to show my resolve here, I will never be accepted as a true member of the group.*

Gadra was highly impressed by Rimuru's generosity. Rimuru had accepted Gadra, who had abandoned the Empire, even though he had reeked of suspicion. Not only that, but he recognized his abilities and entrusted him with a major role. Not to mention, the environment of the monster country was wonderful. It had research facilities that rivaled, if not surpassed, those of the Empire. His best friend Adalmann was also there. Adalmann was now one of the Twelve Guardian Lords, and Gadra was very proud of him.

Moreover:

*As long as they are there, I am sure they will lead me to the deep abyss of my hobby of magical research. In order to live up to that lord's expectations, I have to be useful here.*

Gadra, wishfully thinking of the primordial demons he had hoped would be his masters of magic, recalled the memories and made up his mind. However, his memories were over-embellished. One of them rejected him as if he were a fool, another one almost tricked him into becoming a test subject, and the other one, for some reason, was more interested in swordplay than magic and had invited him to train...but these were all conveniently misinterpreted in Gadra's mind.

Well, there was one demon with whom he had hit it off, praising him after he had complimented Rimuru's magic. So altogether, Gadra's memory wasn't completely wrong... That demon---Diablo---and Gadra had made a pact. If Gadra could find a way to gain Diablo's approval, he would be taken in as one of his dependents. Therefore, Gadra could not die in a place like this.

Rimuru had ordered him not to do anything rash. But---a thought flashed through Gadra's mind.

"I have not been defeated yet!" he shouted. "The battle has just begun, little girl!"

"Kishishishi. Good, good. My power, allow me to carve it into your body!" Gozarin responded.

And the two collided once again.

Gozarin, who was less than half the size of the Demon Colossus, fought back with full force. The scene was quite bizarre. The Demon Colossus, with its superior weight, was being pushed back. Moreover, Gozarin was strange. The surface of her back made a small noise, and countless tentacles sprouted. The tips of these tentacles sharpened to a fine point and thrust into the Demon Colossus.

"Huu?!"

"Kisha!! More, more! Blood. Show me more blood!!"

Gozarin appeared to be overcome in a fever.

Her tentacles were made of magisteel. Moreover, by generating high frequencies with minute vibrations, they could pierce any material like clay. This technique, which could also be used for cutting, was called a high-frequency thousand-hand thrust (K≈çsh≈´ha Senjutotsu), or a high-frequency thousand-hand slash (K≈çsh≈´ha Senjuzan).

Both of the Demon Colossus' hands were easily blown away by the K≈çsh≈´ha Senjuzan. Even if the material was the same magic steel, Gozarin had the advantage because she was a living organism.

"Kuh, the precious body that Rimuru-sama entrusted to me---"

"It's just a piece of junk in front of me. You're an old geezer after all, too old to be relying on a toy like that."

"You're so noisy!"

Gadra shouted in frustration, but his words were full of regret. As proof, Gadra's body had also been pierced by the tentacles, leaving it filled with holes. His body was a bloody wreck, but he remained adamant, taking advantage of the fact that Gozarin could not see him.

"You sure are persistent. This situation is impossible to turn around. There's no need to be ashamed. Even a legendary wizard can't overcome the tide of the times."

"I haven't lost yet!"

"How unsightly."

Two tentacles extended from Gozarin, transforming into blades. Then they cut off both of the Demon Colossus' legs. With that, the Demon Colossus' limbs were gone.

"Swear your obedience to me. And I'll spare your life."

Gadra's knowledge was too valuable to be lost here. That's why Gozarin made the offer, but Gadra did not agree to it.

"I am a selfish person at heart. That's why I can't betray my belief and love of magic. I could never follow someone who mocked magic!!"

His otaku^[The word 'otaku' isn't being used here in the usual way (i.e. a manga/anime geek). It's basically referring to Gadra's magic obsession. Another translation here could be 'nerdy' or 'geeky' because he's a magic fanatic.] soul exploded in full swing. When someone makes fun of something you love, it's possible to get angry from the bottom of your heart.

Gadra's spirit and guts were now burning fiercely. And that anger gave him the determination to cast a forbidden spell. It was a self-destructive spell that converted his own life force into fuel that burned everything violently---'Sacrifice' (Elemental magic Life-sublimation).

*Ahh... I was planning to be recognized by Diablo-sama and become his disciple... Oh, well. I have my own mystic art 'Reincarnation'. I'll be leaving this world for a while, but next time I will aim for the magical abyss!!*

Rather than losing, he chose to win and escape. That was the kind of man Gadra was.

"You choose to resist me? Then you're useless. Die!"

"You too!"

Gozarin's tentacles pierced Gadra's chest. A moment later, a dazzling flash of light erupted from the Demon Colossus. A light that burned through everything. It was the flame of elemental magic 'Sacrifice', which Gadra had unleashed.

"Wh-what the?! Aiming for this---"

Gozarin's words disappeared and were swallowed up by the flames of life.

And on the ground, a small flower bloomed.


![soft scene break]


Gabil was caught up in a disadvantageous battle. Gladium was strong. But even more troublesome was Baraga, who had awakened the power of a Chimera Knight. He was a different person from before. His power could not be underestimated, even by the current Gabil.

If one compared only the amount of magicules, Gabil was superior. Even if you take into account the skill-level of their spearmanship, Gabil was probably better. However, in terms of overall strength, there was not much of a difference. If he threw caution to the wind, he could win, but there were two enemies. With Gladium in the way, Gabil was having a hard time attacking Baraga.

Besides, Gabil had something else to worry about. He was worried about Souka, who was fighting against Gladium's subordinates.

One of the three generals, the "Vermillion Bird" Nazim, appeared to be as strong as a demon lord. She seemed to be of the same race as the demon lord Frey, and Gabil believed that they were similar in strength.

That was why he judged that Souka would not be able to defeat her.

As Gabil evolved, Souka had also become more powerful. She was now strong enough to be considered very powerful amongst the greater majin, but she still could only be considered an adjutant-class for a demon lord. She was not strong enough to fight a demon lord herself, and victory was hopeless.

Souka was currently still alive because Nazim enjoyed cruelly tormenting her. Gabil was aware of this and was anxious to go to her aid.

However, Gladium and Baraga were powerful opponents.

'I'm sorry, Sister. Just hold on'---Gabil prayed for her to endure, but he was focused on his own enemies.

Then another shock struck Gabil. A flash of light broke out on the ground, and at the center of it was Master Gadra.

"Ga-Gadra-dono?!"

The 'Telepathy Net' from Gabil did not go through. What that meant was...

To make matters worse, he saw a small figure standing up. Despite her wounds, Gozarin, one of the three generals, was still safe.

Baraga shot a spear attack at Gabil, who was unable to hide his dismay.

"Look, look, look. You can't afford to distract yourself now, can you?"

"Gwahahaha! Of course. You are no match for me!"

Despite his words, Gabil didn't have room for much more. The odds were stacked against him, and the word "retreat" was beginning to appear in his mind.

But then, reinforcements that Gabil could never have imagined arrived.

"Hey, looks like you're in trouble here. Want me to help you?"

Unexpectedly, it was someone Gabil knew quite well.

"You really don't listen to anyone. I had to ask Milim to transfer me because I was worried about you."

There was another person. The beautiful queen and ruler of the skies.

"Karion-dono, Frey-dono, why are you here?"

Gabil asked in surprise, to which Karion replied with a smile.

![full page image](image4)

"We'll talk later, okay? Let's get rid of these guys first."

Frey nodded lightly, as if agreeing with Karion.

"Now that we are allied, it's only natural that we would send reinforcements. We will also join the fight, so we'll be under Benimaru-dono's command."

Karion's Beast Master's Warrior Alliance, though less than a hundred in number, were a force to be reckoned with.

The same was true of Frey's entourage, the Tensh≈çsh≈´. The warrior-type winged tribes (harpies) were rare, but their power was well-known.

Despite their small numbers, they were the most reliable reinforcements they could get.

"In that case, I'll be counting on you!"

Gabil stopped worrying and accepted the situation.

He had contacted Benimaru for instructions and had received an immediate reply.

<We're working on your situation, but I'm in the process of grasping it through Moss's eyes. Don't let your guard down. That Gladium bastard is up to something. Keep an eye out for those soldiers at the end!>

Benimaru's orders were straightforward. There were no detailed instructions as to who was to deal with whom, just the essentials.

This, on the contrary, made Gabil happy.

It was the feeling that people trusted and relied on him.

"Then, Karion-dono, I would like to ask you to deal with the enemy's general."

"Hehe, so you are aware. That guy is a disgrace to the beastmen. I thought he was dead by now, I'm surprised he's still alive. I'm going to put a stop to him once and for all."

Karion had intended to do so from the very beginning.

That's why he gladly accepted Gabil's instructions.

"So, I guess I'll be dealing with that bird woman, then?"

If you're talking about bird women, Frey might be one too---is what Gabil thought, but he was not so stupid as to be unaware of what would happen if he mentioned that.

Besides, he was worried about his sister, Souka, so Frey's offer was a blessing in disguise.

"Mm. May I ask that of you?"

He asked grandly.

"Yes. Then, I will go."

Frey glanced over to both of her 'Twin Wings.'

"We'll take care of the rest."

"Good luck, Frey-sama!"

Frey nodded and flew away.

Naturally, she headed for "Vermillion Bird" Nazim.

Nazim, who was tormenting Souka, also noticed the sudden intrusion.

"Frey!! I am the true queen of the harpies. Today is the day that I will take revenge for all my years of bitterness!!"

Unbeknownst to Frey herself, Nazim was Frey's twin sister. Nazim was born a powerful mutant, but unfortunately, she was not fertile. Being of female descent, the harpy tribe could not accept a queen who was unable to bear children.

Through no fault of her own, Nazim could not become queen. Nazim was banished by the Queen at the time, as she felt that it would cause problems in the future.

As she wandered around, she was picked up by Gladium, but Nazim's anger and hatred for her people continued to grow.

And now Frey, the symbol of that hatred, was right in front of her.

Nazim felt a strange mixture of joy and hatred as she flew to intercept Frey.

Looking at them from a distance, Karion spoke aloofly.

"Well then, let's get started here, too."

Gladium, on the other hand, gritted his teeth with anger.

"Don't look down on me, damn brat."

"Looks like Frey's dealing with a blood relative too. Hey, I guess it's fate. If we hadn't come as reinforcements, I wouldn't have gotten this opportunity."

"Opportunity?"

"Yeah. I'm gonna kill you and prove that I'm the strongest beastman in the world."

"Load of crap, that's my line!!"

Karion and Gladium were two men with very similar personalities and intonations. Their tempers were fierce, and they would never stand side by side as equals.

Karion was right, this was a battle of fate.

"Let's go."

"Come on. I'll show you the difference in our strength."

Karion activated his Unique Skill 'Beastification'^[Hyakuj≈´-ka can also mean something like 'hundred beast transformation' or 'beast (as in all beasts) transformation'] and became the true form of the Beast Master. He was fully armed and gave his all from the start.

Gladium, on the other hand, had the power of the White Tiger, which he had not shown even in his battle with Gabil. The lone tiger, clad in the Empire's military uniform, intercepted the king of beasts.

On the battlefield, two fronts were formed.

Powerful forces clashed with each other, creating a force field.

Gabil watched the battle.

The reinforcements were moving according to Benimaru's instructions.

There was nothing to worry about. Like the Kurenai and the Hiryuu, they were under the command of Dolph, the leader of the Pegasus Knights.

Benimaru gave appropriate instructions at key points, but he decided that it would be better to leave detailed instructions to those who were in the area.

Gabil also supported this decision. He could imagine that Benimaru would be challenging the enemy leaders, just as he himself was.

And the decision seemed to have been correct.

The Empire's 'Magic Beast Corps' boasted members with high individual combat power, but their movement as a group wasn't great. Therefore, the Allied forces, which were outnumbered, were able to maintain the front line through skillful coordination.

However, there was no denying that they were outnumbered.

The reinforcements were much welcomed, and a counterattack was about to be launched.

"Well, it looks like things are going well. Souka seems to have returned safely to recover, and I must do my best."

"So, you think can afford to look the other way when you're dealing with me."

Gabil, who had his eyes fixed on the battlefield, was met with a sharp spear blow.

His opponent was Baraga.

Gladium had left with Karion, but the battle with Baraga was still ongoing.

"Gwahahaha! There are orders from the Commander-in-Chief, we can't just focus on dealing with you."

"I'm really being underestimated."

"You're the ones who are taking us for fools, aren't you? If that man Gladium had been serious from the start, I might not have survived."

"Hmph! The great beast king^[He is referring to Gladium, but it is a different kanji from the 'king of the beasts' that was used when referring to Karion.] would never take you seriously."

Upon hearing this, Gabil shook his head in disbelief.

"That's just being careless. As the saying goes, "A lion does his best to catch a rabbit." In this world of the weak and the strong, is it not simple etiquette to do your best, no matter who you are up against?"

Gabil responded with pride.

Actually, Gabil couldn't help but think of his comrades as he said this.

There were many who didn't always give their all against their enemies---It suddenly occurred to him.

The first of these was Diablo.

Gabil sometimes challenged him to a mock battle, but he had been beaten down in a rather pathetic manner.

*That person is an exception, isn't he? I can't complain, though, because it would be over in an instant if he got serious... Although we are in the same position, there is a huge difference between Diablo-dono and myself. It's unfortunate, but that is the reality.*

Rimuru had recognized him and given him the highest honor of being one of the "Twelve Guardian Lords." He was proud of this, but more than that, Gabil had become more aware of his own standing.

Having awakened and become stronger, he realized the strength of Diablo and the others.

Even the three demon girls, who were not allowed to evolve at the victory party, were much stronger than the current Gabil. If so, then Diablo, who was stronger than them and had evolved, was a monster beyond Gabil's imagination.

Even if they fought, he could not win. He admitted that this was inevitable, but if he gave up, it really would be the end.

As long as he kept chasing after it without giving up, it did not matter if he could not win right now.

Gabil thought as such, and so always remained ambitious.

It was precisely because of this that Gabil knew what true strength was. Although it was just his instinct, he understood that the strongest were not the likes of Gladium or Baraga.

"That's why I will never be defeated!"

"You fool! Your defeat is already a foregone conclusion. Know that you owe me a debt of gratitude for dying before you can see the hell that lies ahead!!"

Baraga's attacks grew sharper.

Gabil brushed them aside with a parry.

"Hmmm. Are you referring to the change in your soldiers? I'd like to hear about what they've done."

As soon as Gabil pointed this out, Baraga's movements slowed down.

He then glared at Gabil as if he was a little upset.

"Huh...you noticed?"

"Of course. We have a very good commander after all."

"Even so, it's already too late. The order has been given. The only thing you can do is die in despair!"

To prove this, Baraga pointed to the evidence.

It was Gozarin who had fully recovered.

"Hmm, it is indeed an impressive recovery, but that's just the kind of skill a strong opponent should have, is it not?"

He had noticed that Gozarin was fine.

So it was not surprising, Gabil thought.

But Baraga smiled fearlessly.

"No. It's not Gozarin, it's the people around her."

"Huh?"

A chill ran down Gabil's spine.

It was the fallen figure of an Imperial soldier.

He couldn't understand Baraga's intentions, proudly pointing out the death of his comrades.

No, before that---

*Speaking of which, when did those men die?*

He hadn't paid attention to it because there were so many of them, but the number of deaths was extraordinary.

A closer look revealed that many of them had left the front lines and were descending to the ground. Looking at where they were going, he saw that some of them were coughing up blood and collapsing on the spot.

"What?!"

"Did you not notice?"

"It can't be, they died on their own..."

"Exactly. Gladium-sama made his decision. We have now entered the time of great experimentation!!"

With that said, Baraga laughed loudly.

The sound of his insane laughter echoed across the battlefield, chilling the hearts of all who heard it.

Gabil, too, was horrified by what he saw.

Something terrible was happening.

He knew it.


![soft scene break]


Beast King Gladium had issued a directive.

It was a top-secret order.

<All hands, listen up!! Zamud has informed me that His Majesty the Emperor is in danger. In addition, the enemy is said to have summoned a large number of evil demons. Their strength is unknown, but it is estimated to be more than you can handle. If things continue as they are, a great deal of damage is to be expected. Therefore, I've decided to counter them with our last resort. Offer up your courage and loyalty. Activate the trump card I have given you, and you will gain the power to defeat the demons!>

Immediately after issuing the order to the three generals, he also transmitted the order to the soldiers.

The drug to be administered was distributed in the form of pills as a trump card for reinforcements. However, there were restrictions on the use of these pills, and they could not be used without the order of Gladium, the Corps Commander.

Now, the restriction had been lifted by a secret order from Gladium.

*Hmph! If they succeed, they will gain immense power. Besides, there's a chance only a few will be affected by the side effects. If they want to hate me, they can just hate themselves for being unable to adapt!*

Those were Gladium's true feelings.

Gladium was purely a self-centered man at his very core.

Gladium calmly ordered the members of his army to "die". His decision was ruthless, but it was also true that there was a high possibility that the demons would overrun his army if this continued. It was a rational decision to force them to seek power at the risk of death.

The members of the group quickly carried out the order.

Since they were not informed of the contents of the order, there was no hesitation in their actions.

In other words, the forbidden Medical Skill 'The Beast' was activated by the will of the soldiers who knew nothing themselves.

The effect slowly ate away at the bodies of the Magic Beast Corps soldiers.

Because they were in the middle of battle, the changes were overlooked at first. However, as time passed, the results became more clear.

![break]

The ground was covered with the strewn corpses of the dead.

These were the bodies that Gabil saw.

There were also many who rushed into the enemy lines in a rampage.

The Kurenai, Hiryuu, 'Beast Master's Warrior Alliance', and the 'Tensh≈çsh≈´' were forced to struggle against them.

In the midst of the battlefield, there were also those who were confused by their own changes.

These would be the true warriors that Gladium sought.

![break]

- 10,000 dead.

- 5,500 who turned into magic beasts.

- 5,000 who turned into magic beasts and went berserk.

- 5,000 who went berserk in a hybrid human/magic beast form.

- 4,000 who harnessed 'The Beast'.

- 400 who awakened as Chimera Knights.

![break]

The probabilities of success or failure were fixed and had more or less come close to the predictions. Since the population of the experiment was small, it would not have been surprising if the results had been more disastrous.

As a result, the Magic Beast Corps, which had 30,000 members, was greatly reduced in number. However, the power of the corps was greatly increased.

Those who went berserk would immediately be defeated.

They were useful as a decoy, but once it was done, there was no going back. Therefore, Gladium was prepared to abandon them without a single regret.

Of those who survived, only 10,000, half of them, were able to fight with reason. However, this was a little more than Gladium had expected.

More than half of them would be unable to return to human form, but for now, they were a valuable asset. Gladium was satisfied with the results.

Moreover, 400 Chimera Knights had been born.

No matter who their opponents were, they would not be defeated. Gladium nodded his head in satisfaction.

However, it was still too early to relax.

It took some time to achieve this result, but they had yet to reorganize their forces.

Gladium would have liked to take the lead, but unfortunately, Karion was in the way. In that case, he had his three generals to rely on.

"Azure Dragon" Baraga was fighting Gabil.

"Vermillion Bird" Nazim was engaged in a fierce battle with Frey.

![break]

The only one left was "Black Tortoise" Gozarin.

<Gozarin, quickly regroup your troops!>

<Kishishishi, understood. It seems that we've achieved more than expected. I'm very pleased.>

<Hm. I'll leave you to it!>

He gave the order with a simple 'telepathy'.

The current necessity was to reorganize the forces while the 10,000 berserkers were on the loose. Gladium was relieved that Gozarin was okay.

Even the self-centered Gladium trusted those he approved of.

"Heh, can you really afford to look the other way when you're dealing with me?"

"Of course. I'm the legion commander. I'm not some wild beast."

"You call yourself a legion commander at the expense of your own men? You make me laugh."

"Fool, that's what war is all about. If you can't make that kind of judgment, you're just no good. It seems that you were kicked out of the demon lord's position by a newcomer, but I pity those who serve someone so powerless!"

"Shut up!!"

Karion slashed at him in anger, but there was a hint of impatience in his attack.

Unbelievably, Gladium had grown much stronger than he had imagined.

"Hey now, that attack was weak. It was so slow as if you were standing still."

Gladium walked up behind Karion, speaking lightly. His right hand was equipped with a huge claw.

The tiger claw glittered with a silvery white brilliance---the White Tiger (Byakko) Claw. This claw, which also bore the names of two of the Beastketeers^[The 'two beasketeers' part was a little confusing to me, but I'm pretty sure it's referring to Suphia who is also known as the White Tiger Claw. I'm not sure if there was anything else it was referring to, though.], was a special weapon that had transformed into the mythical-grade, loaned to Gladium from the Emperor.

A mythical-grade weapon could slice through any opponent. It was a weapon capable of slaughtering spiritual life forms, and it was a perfect match for Gladium, who possessed god-like speed.

Using his well-trained footwork, Gladium toyed with Karion. Even the Legendary-grade armor that protected Karion was like scrap metal in the face of the White Tiger Claw.

"What's wrong, what's wrong? You said you were going to kill me, but was that all just talk?"

"Shut up. I thought it would be easier to kill you, but it seems my calculations were wrong..."

Karion's training with Milim had made him stronger. That is why he was still able to fight without being fatally wounded.

Gladium was even more surprised about that. The battle power gap was directly related to the difference in weapons performance. Gladium had thought the battle would've ended sooner.

In this respect, the two of them were similar.

Their strengths were also similar, with Karion having the advantage in strength and Gladium having the advantage in weaponry. Overall, Gladium had the advantage.

Understanding this clearly, Gladium moved to finish Karion off without a second thought. But in that moment, something happened that Gladium could have never imagined.

"What? The power...power is welling up?!"

It was a sign of evolution. It was the beginning of the Harvest Festival for a demon lord.

However---awakening under these circumstances was nothing but an obstacle for Gladium.

"Wh-What is this drowsiness..."

Gladium wobbled unsteadily. Karion did not miss this opportunity and escaped his crisis, regaining his position.

"What's wrong, are you tired already?"

Karion observed Gladium while trying to stir him up.

Something was happening.

Was this something bad or something auspicious...?

As anyone could tell, Gladium's power was beginning to increase. This was because magicules were gathering together and a huge amount of youki was flowing out of him.

And yet, Gladium himself was wobbling around, barely able to stand up.

*What's going on? Is this guy really awakening?*

A story Karion had heard recently came to his mind.

At a victory party held by Rimuru, an evolutionary ritual was performed. It was reported that some of the executives left the party after being lulled into an irresistible slumber.

*Wasn't it said that to become a True Demon Lord, you need to sleep? If that's the case, then isn't this the exact moment?!*

Karion was not a fool, but he was not the most perceptive either. This time, however, he was able to show brilliant insight, as if his life was at stake.

*According to Frey's guess, 'souls' are necessary for evolution... Oh yeah, Gladium's subordinates are dying all over the place...*

That's right, all of the conditions were met.

What was needed to evolve into a True Demon Lord was a hateful 'soul'. Of course, this was not the case for all of them, but enduring the hatred of those you have killed was one of the trials necessary for awakening.

Gladium was left defenseless in a situation as critical as "in the middle of a battle."

It was karmic retribution.

The subordinates who trusted Gladium must have felt betrayed. Their souls were filled with hatred and turned on Gladium, the object of their resentment.

Karion did not see it that accurately, but he judged this to be both the greatest danger and the greatest opportunity at the same time.

"It seems that heaven is on my side."

"W-Wait! Wait just a moment."

"Haven't you always been living your life as you please? It's time for you to pay for it."

"Calm down and think it over. You can only call yourself the strongest if you defeat me in perfect condition. I'm sure you wouldn't want to settle this half-heartedly!"

Gladium was getting really impatient.

He felt like he was about to be killed, but he was feeling so sleepy. The situation was so unexpected that he could not think of any countermeasures.

He looked around for his trusty subordinates, but Baraga and Nazim were in a fierce battle. Gozarin was in the process of reorganizing the Chimera Knights, but with the onslaught from Rimuru's forces, she didn't seem to have the time to come and help Gladium.

At least for this moment, no one could come to Gladium's aid.

Gladium dropped to his knees.

*It can't be, damn it!! Just when I was finally one step away from obtaining the greatest power---*

He could feel the power flooding into him.

As if in proportion to that, there was a rush of sleepiness coming over him that made it impossible to resist.

If only the awakening could be achieved, he could defeat even Velgrynd. Gladium thought as such, but the reality was cruel.

There was no reason why Gladium would be able to endure the ordeal that even Rimuru was unable to resist.

His face was a mess of tears and regret.

"Screw you! Screw you, damn it!"

After a final shout, Gladium fell asleep.

For those who are unable to overcome their trials---death was the only ending.

"It's good, because you can die in your sleep. Now then, goodbye! 'Beast Roar'!"

Karion was not the kind of compassionate man who would show mercy here.

When he was a demon lord, he believed himself to be the strongest, but now Karion was a general who led an army. Because he had come as backup, it was natural for him to put victory before his own pride.

The man whose burning ambitions could have gotten him to a higher level was overthrown by Karion.


![soft scene break]


The three remaining generals were panicking at the unimaginable defeat of their legion commander.

They were companions who had been fascinated by Gladium and had shared common dreams.

Their anger and grief was considerable and affected the war situation.

Baraga was the first to take action.

He stopped facing Gabil, turned on his heels and rushed to Gladium's side.

"Gladium-sama!!"

Everything from Gladium's neck down was obliterated by Karion's Beast Roar. The only thing that remained was his head with a regretful expression on his face, and it was obvious that it would be impossible to revive him from this state.

"Oh, how...how could this be? Just when we were so close to achieving our long-cherished goal..."

Chasing the lamenting Baraga, Gabil also rushed over. Then, without hesitation, he aimed the Vortex Spear, the treasure of the lizardmen, at Baraga.

With his gaze fixed on Baraga, Gabil opened his mouth.

"Karion-dono, that was an impressive victory! I was impressed by your dignity!"

This was a compliment to Karion for defeating the enemy, but it was Gabil's true feelings. Gladium's power, which could even handle mythical-grade weapons, was greater than Gabil's, even though he was a Demon Lord Seed.

It was only natural for him to admire Karion for defeating him, even if it was a combination of chance and luck.

However, Karion, the one who was praised, began to turn pale for some reason.

"Whoa, whoa, I thought there was no way, but this might be..."

He didn't appear able to reply to Gabil and seemed to be wondering about something.

"Mm? Is something wrong?"

Gabil asked if he was feeling unwell, and Karion looked at him like he was in a daze.

And then he told him a shocking truth.

"Sorry, I came all this way to help you, but it looks like I'm done here."

"Now way, are you hurt?!"

"No, that's not it. It's the awakening, I guess. Apparently, the souls that Gladium was supposed to receive have gone to me. It's a grudge. For being so defenseless at this point, I can't even laugh at Gladium anymore..."

"What?!"

Karion couldn't help but mock himself.

Sensing the situation, Gabil was unable to hide his turmoil.

"Sorry, but I'm going to fall asleep here. If you can afford it, protect me."

"Of course! Please rest assured."

Gabil smiled as if to reassure Karion.

Karion returned the smile and then fell over on his back. Then with a final word about hoping to awaken safely, he drifted off to sleep.

He may seem fearless, but even he could not resist the evolutionary sleep.

Baraga was not amused. If the situation had been even a little different, then he would have been in Gabil's position. And instead of Karion, Gladium would have been the one in an evolutionary sleep.

"Uooooooo!! I'll never forgive you. I won't allow you to take advantage of this when you've done absolutely nothing to deserve it!!"

In a rage, he turned his hateful eyes towards Gabil and Karion.

In Baraga's hand, the shining relic of Gladium was being held.

The White Tiger Claw---It was the ultimate mythical-grade weapon, a weapon that embodied the will of its owner, whom it recognized as its master.

"Lend me your strength, O White Tiger Claw. Let me avenge Gladium-sama's death!!"

As if in response to Baraga's voice, the glow of the White Tiger Claw increased.

The light converged and a spear took shape.

"Ah... You've acknowledged me as your master!"

Baraga rejoiced.

In his hand, he held the Azure Dragon Spear, which was transformed from the White Tiger's claw.

"Gabil, was it? I'll kill you and get rid of the thief who sleeps over there!"

"That's nonsense! I, too, have made a pact between men. The evolutionary sleep of Karion-dono, you should know that it shall not be disturbed by any means!"

Gabil yelled back.

And so, the battle between the two men resumed.

Frey, who had been fighting while flying at high speed, had also been using her clairvoyance---the Extra Skill 'Celestial Eye' that allowed her to grasp the coordinates of a specific area and see everything within it.

"...I see, so that's how evolution works."

Frey had a clear mind and was able to understand what was happening on the ground.

Even while fighting Nazim, Frey had arrived at the correct answer.

"It can't be, Gladium-sama..."

"The saying goes that luck is also a part of one's strength, and it's true."

"How dare you!! You can't even defeat me, so how dare you mock Gladium-sama!!"

"That's not true. I was just stating a fact, not trying to mock him. Besides, I'm not the one who's helpless, I just haven't struck yet. I hope you haven't mistaken my actions."

Even though Frey rarely made a move of her own, her strength as an ex-demon lord was not to be underestimated. Although the "Vermillion Bird" Nazim, was more powerful in terms of magicule quantity, Frey had only been using speed and technique.

"All you do is scurry away and talk a big game."

"You'll have to wait until after the fight to decide if I was talking big or not."

She wouldn't be defeated in this argument.

There are people in this world who were very good at making their opponents feel uncomfortable. Frey was one of those types of people, and even Demon Lord Milim couldn't win one over Frey.

And Frey was not just flying around.

She was observing her opponent and searching for her weaknesses.

There was no way she could win by force.

Frey was faster, but her opponent was stronger in power.

At this rate, Frey would be outmatched, but the opportunity to win could be found in unexpected places.

"You're feeling impatient."

"Huh? How dare you---"

"Thanks to these eyes, I'm finally able to see souls. It is a very useful ability."

Frey had become aware that the performance of her Extra Skill 'Celestial Eye' had been improved. She smiled, thinking that this would give her an advantage in battle.

What's more, she was sure that the information she had just obtained would be the key to victory.

"What did you say you can see?"

Nazim spat viciously, her claws finally catching hold of Frey's arms.

Nazim smirked and laughed. The claws of the harpy had the effect of 'Magic Interference' and could block the Skills of the captured opponent.

"Ahahahaha! What a fool you are. Did you get so absorbed in the middle of a conversation that you got caught?"

Nazim's tone brightened, as she had become sure of her victory. This attitude proved even more that Nazim was impatient.

Frey remained calm in the face of danger.

She continued to observe Nazim, nonchalantly confirming her impatience.

"Take this! 'Shockwave'!!"

From here, Nazim's onslaught began, as if it were a one-sided affair.

Frey's clothes were torn apart by the impact. However, Frey's face was not distorted by anguish, and she continued to observe Nazim in a cool manner.

Nazim noticed that Frey was acting strangely, but decided that she was just bluffing.

As much as it pained her to admit it, Frey, her twin, was very intelligent. Nazim was the better fighter in simple combat power, but her opponent was a troublesome one to deal with.

*Are you trying to trick me? No, trying to get away from these claws---this woman must be planning to turn the tables on me at the right moment.*

Nazim tormented Frey even more, as if the right thing to do was to continue the attack.

Despite this, Frey remained unfazed.

"Just a little more, huh?"

Frey spoke quietly, but the words rang loudly in Nazim's ears. She couldn't help but ask, "What do you mean by that?!"

"You're about to be awakened, aren't you? Compared to the beginning of the battle, the amount of magicules you have has increased dramatically. It seems that when you awaken, you will fall asleep just like Gladium. I just have to wait for that moment."

Frey said with a devilish smile on her face.

Nazim paled.

She had wondered if it was possible, having been aware of the symptoms.

This was the cause of Nazim's impatience. The moment Frey noticed this, Nazim was basically dancing in the palm of her hand.

"Then so what?! All I have to do is kill you right now and retreat to safety!!"

Nazim's dismay was compounded by the truth of Frey's words.

She had to get rid of Frey before the evolutionary slumber set in. She had come to that decision, and increased the power of her attack by using all of her strength.

Nazim had no way to realize that this was exactly what Frey was aiming for.

"'Shockwave'!!"

It was already unknown how many times she had done this, but there was an intense electric shock that burned Frey. However, Frey did not receive a single burn or even a scratch from the impact.

*Isn't it strange?! Why is this person acting so calm?*

By the time she realized it, it was already too late.

"You seem curious. But your reaction confirms it. My mother, the previous queen, wanted you to be happy in a world where the herd didn't matter, away from racial strife."

"Excuse me?"

"If you had known the queen's secret, then you would have had to be killed. That's why she banished you without telling you anything."

"Don't screw with me! There's no way a newborn fledgling could survive being abandoned! That was a clear attempt to kill me off!!"

Nazim shouted in a rage.

However, Frey calmly contradicted her.

"But you survived. That fact is proof that there was someone hiding and taking care of you. Mother was also naive."

"...?!"

It was something Nazim had always wondered about.

She had always wondered how she had been able to survive as a child until her ego was properly sprouted.

She had been convinced that she had survived instinctively because she was a mutant. However, after hearing Frey's words, she began to wonder if it was possible.

However, Nazim, who had accumulated so much hatred, could not change her way of thinking now.

"You're bluffing! Yeah, I get it. You're trying to trick me and aiming for a counter attack. It would have been cute if you had just begged for your life, but your pride as an ex-demon lord wouldn't let you do that, would it?"

She tried to believe that Frey, who had no choice, was just playing a trick on her.

That made sense. Forcing herself to think that way, Nazim increased the power of her blasts, determined not to be deceived.

"Die!! Maximum Shockwave!!"

The full force of the purple lightning struck Frey. It was the moment Frey had been waiting for.

"It's pathetic. Even thought you were let off the hook, you've come back on your own to die."

"Ah?"

"There can only ever be one queen. I had to kill my mother to take her place. Of course, if you hadn't been abandoned, you would have had to kill me."

"Then I would have killed you!"

Nazim, a rare combat type, had absolute confidence in her fighting abilities.

Although she lost to Frey in terms of flying speed, she was superior in all other areas. There was no way she could lose in a fight, and she was on the verge of victory right now.

Nazim wanted to scoff at Frey's words as they were not even sincere. But Frey's next words made her change her expression.

"Being a harpy queen requires a lot of abilities. Only those who are born with them will be recognized as the next queen. You were unlucky enough to be born as my twin."

"You've really been talking smugly to me this whole time---"

"Then I'll get right to the point. The queen has an absolute advantage over any attacks from her own kind. In other words, any attacks from a harpy will not work on me."

"Don't lie to me! There's no way such a ridiculous thing can be true!!"

In a corner of her mind, Nazim thought about what it meant if it were true, but she brushed it off as improbable. If the story really was true, it would contradict the murder of the previous queen.

"You wanted to confuse me with a random story, but you should have come up with something more believable!"

"It's sad that you can't believe me, but it's true. Incidentally, the battle between the old and new queens doesn't always take place. Normally, two sisters with the same ability will fight each other, and the one who can dominate the other's power will be crowned queen."

The truth is that one would also get the Demon Lord Seed at the same time.

"What?!"

"Because you were born as a mutant, it was up to me to kill my mother. What's even more unforgivable is that you trampled on my mother's wish to keep you alive. I don't know if you're my sister or not, but I wish you could have lived somewhere quietly."

"Don't be silly! Do you think you've already won? I'm your sister, and I also have fighting abilities other than the harpy race. If you I use that---"

"It's too late. I already have enough energy saved. I don't want you to suffer, so I'll end it with one blow."

"I-It can't be?!"

It was only then that Nazim noticed that Frey's wings had turned purple. The beautiful pure white wings with golden mesh had become discolored with purple electricity.

Nazim froze in fear as she realized what this meant.

*She was storing the shockwave I released?! If so, how powerful is---?!*

She tried to escape in a panic, but the claws holding Frey's arms were stuck. Frey's slender hands were also attached to Nazim's wrists.

If Nazim had been awakened before she met Frey, the outcome might have been different. But unfortunately, that was only a hypothetical story.

"Goodbye, elder sister. 'Echo Reflection'!!"

"Wait---?!"

Frey did not hesitate. All feelings had been left behind when she had become queen.

All the accumulated purple electricity was released at once.

This was the ability that Frey had acquired---the Unique Skill 'Double Winner'. Frey was able to strike back at her opponent with any attack she received.

It was a difficult Skill to use because the user was also damaged, but in this case, since it was an attack from one of her own kind, this was Frey's complete dominance, despite the fact that the enemy was stronger.

Nazim, who had been hit by all the accumulated electric shocks, was charred to death in an instant.

"I don't care if you're my sister or not, but I feel troubled by my mother's sweetness...Still, I'm a little jealous, elder sister. At least, you certainly received my mother's love---"

Frey bid those words of farewell to Nazim as she fell.

Those words never reached Nazim.

The harpy sisters failed to understand each other, and the time of their reunion had come to an end.

![break]

---It would have been nice if it had ended there.

"---What?! The souls that gathered in Nazim are coming towards me!!"

A sudden drowsiness overtook Frey.

"No way, then is this the evolutionary sleep? So instead of Nazim, the grudge is being taken out on me..."

It wasn't that Frey did not wish to awaken as a True Demon Lord, but there was still the matter of the time and place.

She had planned to laugh at Karion's stupidity later, but now Frey was filled with the feeling that this was not a joke.

But there was no point in complaining now.

"Rucia^[Normally, I might have called this person Lucia, but there is already a character called Lucia (Veldanava's wife) and the Japanese of the two names are different, so it didn't feel right to use the exact same name. To be specific, the name used right here is "„É´„ÉÅ„Ç¢" which in English sounds like *Ruchia*---so I'm using **Rucia** (I personally would have used 'Lutia', but 'Rucia' came up in a few online searches, so I ended up going with that). The other name is "„É´„Ç∑„Ç¢" which in English is *Rushia*---so **Lucia** is used there (you'll see more of Lucia in future volumes).], Claire! You have to protect me. Protect Karion as well."

"Understood, Frey-sama!"

"As the Queen commands!"

The twins responded immediately.

As soon as she saw this, Frey flew next to Karion.

She decided that it would be easier to protect them if they were grouped together rather than if they were separated. Besides, since Suphia of the Beastketeers was defending Karion's side, she thought that fighting alongside the Twin Wings would increase the chances of survival.

That said...

*Oh dear. Even though I was the one who came as reinforcement, I only ended up slowing everyone down. I didn't think that I would end up in such a mess, falling asleep in the middle of a battlefield.*

Inwardly, she was writhing in shame.

This was something that Frey had never expected.

Without knowing if she would wake up again, Frey reluctantly fell asleep.


![soft scene break]


Gabil was fighting a deadly battle with Baraga.

It was the Azure Dragon Spear in Baraga's hand that decided the outcome.

From Gabil's perspective, the difference in weaponry deciding the battle was unacceptable. However, in reality, even Gabil's own 'Dragon Skin' was unable to prevent getting stabbed by the Azure Dragon Spear.

"To have wounded me, you should not be underestimated."

"Kakaka! That's my line. I had planned to kill you with a single blow, but you're tougher than I thought."

Both of them were covered in wounds. However, neither of them stopped their attacks. The wounds kept increasing, but neither of them seemed to care.

"It's surprising that you're evenly matched with me who has awakened. But I can't lose!"

"Hmph! Gladium-sama would have been stronger than you even if he hadn't been awakened. If he had, he wouldn't have even struggled against you lot."

"Nonsense! There are many under Rimuru-sama's command who are stronger than I am! You're pretty good, but you're nothing but small fry compared to someone like Miss Ultima."

Those words were equivalent to calling himself a small fish, but Gabil didn't seem to notice. Although lacking in that aspect, he himself took this statement very seriously.

Although Gabil was struggling, he did not neglect to check the current war situation.

In order not to involve the sleeping Karion, he dared to show an opening to induce Baraga's actions. Thanks to his efforts, he succeeded in shifting the location of the battle little by little.

*Suphia-dono has also rushed to his aid, so Karion-dono should be fine. Besides, I'm sure I can pull off a few big moves without getting them involved here.*

In his own way, Gabil was thinking about many things as he fought.

As he was doing so, Frey also defeated one of the three generals.

"No way?! Even Nazim has been defeated!!"

In addition to the Glasium, the female commander who had been the second-in-command had also been killed. When confronted with this fact, Baraga was furious.

"I absolutely won't forgive you! I will use my spear to avenge the death of my comrades!!" He shouted.

From here, Baraga came into his own.

"A true Chimera Knight is a warrior who has mastered the Beastmen's Intrinsic Skill 'Beastification (beast transformation)'. Do you understand? If you can endure the artificially given Medical Skill 'The Beast', you gain the ability to combine the power of man and beast."

As he began to explain, Baraga's body began to change more and more. Until now, he had maintained the form of a human, but now the features of a dragon were beginning to appear more and more.

His military uniform swelled, but it did not tear.

Baraga had transformed into a form that resembled a dragon-like dragonewt.

"This feels amazing!. The release of my true power is such a freeing feeling!"

It was Baraga's first time trying to reach this level. Whether or not the transformation would be successful---He had only imagined doing it himself and hadn't told anyone about the transformation.

But now, with the death of Gladium, the shackles of Baraga's mind had been lifted. And now that his colleague Nazim had been defeated, there was no reason for him to hesitate.

"Come here, you guys!"

Baraga called out to his subordinates, who were running rampant. Even the poor soldiers, who had become magic beasts without a will, would obey the orders of the overwhelmingly powerful. Their instincts recognized him as their superior.

Not only were there those who had turned into magic beasts, but there were also those who had taken the form of humans mixed with beasts. Baraga took a bite out of one of them at random.

The magicules flowed into Baraga like a throbbing pulse. The one who was eaten dried up like a mummy, and his life was lost on the spot.

"How dare you! Those were your subordinates. And yet---"

"They should be grateful that they were lucky enough to die in my service."

"How selfish! Do not think that I will let you get away with such cruelty!"

Gabil made a piercing attack.

He instinctively understood that there would be trouble if he left things unattended.

Judging from the situation, he was probably replenishing energy from his subordinates in order to meet the new maximum value that had increased by his transformation.

Baraga's magicule level was still on par with Gabil's. He was on the verge of becoming an artificially awakened demon lord, it would be unfair to blame Gabil for his impatience.

However, impatience leads to the worst possible outcomes.

"Fool! On the battlefield, those who lose their common sense are bound to die. Did you really think I would be so absorbed in my meal that I would let my guard down?!"

Baraga's actions had a double meaning. The first was to compensate for the increase in his strength. The other was to put Gabil on a timer. The plan worked, and Gabil had jumped to his death.

"What?!"

By the time he realized what was happening, it was too late.

With his foot, Baraga skillfully manipulated the Azure Dragon Spear. The tip of the spear pierced Gabil's belly as he jumped into the air.

The magisteel breastplate did not cover his abdomen, and even Gabil's 'Dragon Skin' could not withstand a sneak strike.

"Gw-gwah!!"

Gabil coughed up blood as he was pierced in the stomach.

Seeing this, Baraga laughed loudly.

"Kakakaka! You'll become my food too. Be honored!!"

Gabil was in a desperate crisis---but it seemed fate would not allow his death.

![break]

<<Confirmed. The effect of Unique Skill 'Lucky Devil' has been activated... Successful. Individual Name: Gabil's fate has been changed, and "death" has been avoided.>>

![break]

It was the "Voice of the World."

At that moment, Gabil's fate was altered by the power of his Unique Skill 'Lucky Devil', which he himself had forgotten about.

It was a Unique Skill that he had acquired when Rimuru became a demon lord, but its effect was unknown. The only thing he knew was that it sometimes increased or decreased the power of his attacks.

The effect made his attacks become stronger when he was in a good mood and become weaker when he was in a weak^[Weak as in cowardly or faint-hearted.] mood. In a sense, it was the perfect ability for Gabil, but it was not a Skill that was easy to use.

However, Gabil's life had been saved by this Unique Skill, apparently its full abilities were still unknown.

"Gwah?! What? I thought I had just been pierced in the stomach..."

However, Gabil was a man who did not care about the details, so he stopped thinking about what just happened and retook his stance against Baraga.

"How can that be?! What the hell just happened?"

From Baraga's point of view, this was not so easy to ignore.

He had just managed to trick a foe as powerful as Gabil into thinking that he could finally defeat him, yet Gabil had stood up after his counterattack. It was only natural that he thought it was a trick. He had been sure of his victory so long as he could land that blow.

"Don't be ridiculous, you bastard! Let's go again, this time I'll make sure to pierce your heart!!"

He absorbed magicules and increased his strength. It would be a piece of cake to defeat Gabil without the need for any tricks, Baraga thought to himself, holding his Azure Dragon Spear back in his hands.

The two men were once again in a staring contest, ready to strike at the opportune moment.

Gabil was at a disadvantage.

He was fortunate to have his life saved once, but it would not happen again.

Unbeknownst to Gabil, the Unique Skill 'Lucky Devil's' ability 'Change Fate', once activated, had a long period of time before it could be used again.

No matter how good the Skill was, the limit on that abilty was once a day.

Therefore, Gabil was out of options. The continuous fighting had exhausted his strength. He had just risen from the brink of death and was in need of rest.

Despite this situation, Gabil smiled bravely, showing no signs of weakness.

"Gwahahaha! Your skills are brilliant, but I will not lose to you. After all, my master is excellent, so you should not expect to win so easily."

Gabil sharpened his concentration so that he would be ready for any move Baraga might make.

![break]

---At that moment, the fate of the battle was decided---

![break]

It was not because of Gabil's Unique Skill, but because of the birth of "Ciel" in Rimuru's heart.

Just as Gabil was about to struggle with all his might, a voice from the heavens came to his aid.

![break]

<<Do you want power? Then I will give it to you. Please agree to the modification of your Unique Skills.>>

![break]

*---?!*

Gabil did not ask back what that meant.

The voice was so nostalgic, and so warm, that just listening to it made him feel calm. And so, without hesitation, Gabil agreed.

The effect was dramatic.

![break]

<<You made the right choice. The Unique Skill 'Lucky Devil' will be sacrificed to give you new powers.>>

![break]

As soon as the voice disappeared, a new power awakened in Gabil.

![break]

Ultimate Skill 'Psychology King Mood Maker'---The skill granted by Ciel included five effects: 'Thought Acceleration,' 'Change Destiny,' 'Unexpected Effects,' 'Spatial Manipulation,' and 'Multilayer Barrier'.

'Thought Acceleration' increased his speed of perception by a million times.

'Change Destiny' was a superior version of the Unique Skill 'Lucky Devil's' 'Change Fate,' and could be activated at Gabil's will. However, the frequency of use was still limited to once a day.

'Unexpected Effects' was also a superior version of the 'Lucky Devil's' ability 'Unforeseen Effects'. It allowed one to activate the increase in attack power at their will. However, the amount it increased still depended on the user's mood. This ability allowed one to increase his attack power when he was in an uplifted mood.

'Spatial Manipulation' was an ability that could be used by the executives led by Benimaru. Its main purpose was 'Spatial Transportation', and it was a useful ability that allowed one to move freely in a place he had been to before, as long as the space was not being interfered with. By interfering with the space, one could be expected to be able to block the escape of enemies. It was a useful power.

The 'Multilayer Barrier' was a defensive technique that Rimuru specialized in. By layering 'Barriers' of various effects, it was possible to prepare for any attack. By accepting Rimuru's power, Gabil was able to use this as well.

The effects of previously thought to be useless Skills were now properly recognized by Gabil. Ciel taught it to him in his period of thought acceleration, which had been stretched a million times over.

Gabil was deeply moved. He couldn't help but speak.

"It's amazing, so amazing! I feel like I can't lose!!"

He was getting carried away, but in Gabil's case, this was the right thing to do.

Gabil laughed, blowing away the gloomy atmosphere. As if in proportion, Gabil's power increased greatly.

"Wh-What the hell is the matter with you?! Your power has suddenly increased. What the hell did you do---?!"

"Gwahahaha! It is unfortunate for you...but I have a great leader. As long as I have his protection, there is no way I can be defeated!"

In an uplifted mood, Gabil, who might've been defeated depending on the situation, uttered his proud words. At the same time, Gabil's body began overflowing with power.

It was difficult to stop his momentum one he had started.

"Now, prepare yourself!"

"Quit speaking nonsense! My power, I will carve it into your body!!"

Both men, who were comparable to awakened demon lords, clashed with their full power, and a moment later, it was Gabil who won the battle.

Gabil's Vortex Spear precisely flicked away the Azure Dragon Spear that had been unleashed with all Baraga's might. This left a huge opening, and before Baraga could regain his stance, Gabil's stabbed a huge hole in his chest.

"Gah! N-not yet. With my healing ability, a wound of this magnitude..."

Yes, Baraga had also inherited the Beastmen's high healing power, and by replenishing the energy from his subordinates, he could heal some wounds instantly.

Baraga tried to get through using it this time as well. But that was not to be.

To Gabil's own wonder, the combination of 'Change Destiny' and 'Unexpected Effects' was automatically activated, taking away Baraga's ability to heal.

'Change Destiny' could only be used once a day, but that was only against the same target. So it turned out that it could also be used on enemies.

As Baraga himself had said, 'on the battlefield, those who lose their common sense are the first to die'.

"Wow, it's more powerful than I expected..."

And so, Gabil, with his newly gained powers, was victorious.


![soft scene break]


Meanwhile, the last of the three remaining generals, "Black Tortoise" Gozarin, was facing an unexpectedly powerful opponent.

![break]

With the defeat of the legion commander Gladium, the Magic Beast Corps had fallen into chaos. Before they could manage to put things together, a huge army of demons arrived.

It was called a huge army, but the number of individuals was not actually that large.

There were only about 500 of them. However, their quality was worthy of being called a match for the thousands^[In Japanese, they are described with the saying "Ikki Tousen (‰∏ÄÈ®éÂΩìÂçÉ)" which refers to "being a match for a thousand" or "being an unmatched warrior/mighty hero" or being "a mighty knight who matches a thousand knights."].

They were high-ranking demon knights, the Devil Chevaliers---A terrifying battle group under the direct command of Demon Lord Rimuru. The Chimera Knights had almost twice the amount of magicules, but surprisingly, they were unable to gain an advantage in battle. That was how powerful the demons were.

Gozarin's frustration grew as things did not go her way. In the midst of this situation, the fateful moment arrived.

*That's, what the...*

Out of the corner of Gozarin's eye, she saw a moving shadow.

For some reason, a strange feeling appealed to her instincts. Trying to figure out what it was, Gozarin took her eyes off the battlefield and focused on the shadow.

It was the right thing to do.

If she had left the shadow alone, Gozarin would have died without understanding what had happened.

However...Gozarin might have been happier if she had just died without knowing.

The shadow stirred where the wreckage of Demon Colossus lay. In front of Gozarin, who was watching to see what was going on, the shadow stood up.

It was a handsome man with a naked upper body and long black hair that reached his waist.

His complexion was dark brown with a slight sheen.

It was as if he were made of metal---No, from the waist down, he was melded with the remains of the Demon Colossus.

Right before Gozarin's eyes, the wreckage melted and changed its shape. And the man's lower body was also completed.

"Hey, I'm naked. How embarrassing."

The tone of voice was very similar to that of the man Gozarin had just been fighting.

"Y-You, I can't believe it, but...are you a Master Gadra?"

Gozarin asked, and the man smirked.

"Of course it's me! Or did you think you had already won? That's right, I would never accept that."

Yes, the mysterious naked man was Master Gadra himself.

"What are you talking about?! You died from a self-destructing spell! That spell was supposed to burn up your life, so how are you still alive?!"

Gozarin shouted.

Her comprehension still hadn't caught up with the situation, but hearing Gadra's words made her even more confused. She tried to change the flow of the conversation, thinking that it would be a bad idea to be carried by Gadra's pace.

"Oh, yes, I remember now. I blew myself up with 'Sacrifice', didn't I? Did you think that I was dead? Though, it's impossible for a man like me to kill himself. Until the battle is over, you should not relax and believe that you have won."

As he spoke at length, Gadra created a garment with magic and hurriedly put it on. It was a shabby outfit, but he decided that it was better than being naked.

"Enough of this nonsense, answer my question!"

As for Gozarin, she wanted to get rid of Gadra without a second thought. However, she was cautious because a person who was supposed to be completely dead had come back to life.

She wasn't even sure if Gadra would answer honestly. That's why Gozarin was going to put all of her energy into her next attack, regardless of Gadra's response.

*It's the old man after all, so I'm sure he had some strange trick up his sleeve. Perhaps he prepared a substitute sacrifice. He's trying to upset me, but he's playing an elaborate trick. However, I'm sure I'll be able to crush this little trick with my own strength!*

Gozarin's magisteel body, despite its appearance, was extremely heavy. Therefore, even if one hit her at a certain speed, she could still show its power.

In addition to that, if Gozarin performed a K≈çsh≈´ha Senjuzan (high-frequency thousand-hand slash) with the tentacles all over her body, she would turn into a living bullet that could pulverize everything she touched.

Gozarin put all of her strength into her legs.

She used herself as a cannonball and gained propulsion by exploding the earth. This was Gozarin's other killer move.

Gozarin took aim at Gadra.

Unaware of this, Gadra politely began to explain.

"That's right, I have been reincarnated. The mystic art I developed: 'Reincarnation', was planted in advance. As long as I use this, I'll be able to live a new life with my memories intact, even if I have to say goodbye to this world for a little while. It's a wonderful secret."

"...So then?"

"The success rate is a little low, but the relative returns are great. I've also been reincarnated so many times that success is almost always guaranteed---"

In fact, the first time one tried this, the success rate was at it's lowest. Adalmann's failure at that time had not been due to Gadra's poor skill.

Gadra had prepared several spells in advance, ready to be unleashed at a moment's notice. Razen, for example, could only prepare one or two at most, but Gadra could have three or more spells constantly ready.

A transfer spell for escape, and a self-destructive spell for suicide. He had never left out a reincarnation spell, just in case he died.

Gadra was a cautious person, but this time, something unexpected had happened.

'Reincarnation' was triggered, and his soul slipped out of his body. Protected by magic, the soul was supposed to return to the Wheel of Reincarnation in search of a new body.

However, a promise had been made at this point.

Actually, Gadra had applied to be Diablo's disciple, but that had been put on hold. Normally, this would have been an instant rejection, but Gadra had been favored by Diablo.

By praising Rimuru's magic, Diablo had taken a liking to him.

*"I don't dislike interesting guys like you. Once I recognize that you are truly useful to Rimuru-sama, I will take you in as my dependent."*

That's what he had told him at the banquet.

Gadra had thought it was a polite excuse to refuse him, but he was still planning to do his best to be accepted by Diablo. However, by that time, he had been taken by Diablo's "Temptation."

And so, Gadra's 'Reincarnation' was rewritten. If he chose to die for Rimuru, he would be reborn as a demon.

And demons were a race born with the ability to fight. Because Gadra possessed a lifetime of his memories, it was only natural that he was born as a special individual after becoming a demon.

The problem was his body.

A demon, a spiritual life form, needed a body to stay in this world.

Normally, Gadra would have had to possess someone, or contact Diablo and wait for him to summon him. However, with the birth of Ciel in Rimuru's mind, the fate of the world was decided here as well.

![break]

<<If you want a physical body, I will give it to you. I will also give you more power. That's why--->>

The voice told him to be of service to Rimuru-sama.

From Gadra's perspective, this was the best thing that could ever happen to him.

'Of course'---he shouted at the top of his lungs.

And with that, the contract was concluded and Gadra was successfully reincarnated.

He was reborn as a new race, a Metal Demon.

As if to prove himself as a black dependent, his body was clad in black. His hair, eyes, and bare skin all had black components. Even so, he had a metallic luster, giving him a somewhat artificial atmosphere.

However, this figure was not the original Gadra's appearance, but rather a replica of his younger self---his first life before being reborn. It was recreated from the memories engraved in his soul and had nothing to do with his race.

Perhaps because he was of a new race, he did not have the limitations of the demon race. Gadra's current magicule count was comparable to Clayman is his rampant state^[Pretty sure this is referring to Clayman's pre-awakened state---Tensura's No.1 power-scaling method.]. Add to that the knowledge and experience he had before he was reborn, and there was no doubt that he had become much stronger.

Gadra himself also felt that he had been reborn. As if to savor the emotion, he couldn't help but be talkative and speak to Gozarin.

"In other words, you've become something unheard of like a metal demon?"

"That's how it is. Be warned, I have gotten stronger. You do not stand a chance, so surrender. As a former colleague, I will spare your life."

"All I have to say is that you're a fool!"

Gozarin, who was well-prepared and waiting for an opportunity, rushed towards Gadra. The tremendous speed turned Gozarin's body into a massive bullet.

There was no way that Gadra would be able to deal with this. Gozarin thought as such, but the next moment, her eyes widened in astonishment.

To her surprise, she deviated from Gadra's direction without any intention of her own.

"Mysterious, isn't it? Well, to put it simply, I manipulated the magnetic field with magic to create a powerful magnetic field. By passing an electric current through it, it is possible to electromagnetically induce an object as you can see now."

In this case, the object was Gozarin. For Gadra, who studied the science of the Otherworld, there were many things he could do with magic. In other words, Gozarin's inner workings could be easily sealed by Gadra.

"You..."

Standing aloofly, Gadra held a large book in his left hand. He was carefully flipping through the pages with his right hand.

"Well? Now do you understand what I can do? You should give up and surrender."

Gozarin took these words as a sign of condescension. Gadra didn't mean it that way, but Gozarin's pride as a powerful opponent had been hurt.

That was why surrender was not an option.

"Very well. I didn't want to use this, but I've come to my senses!"

Gozarin swallowed the pill.

She activated the Medical Skill, 'The Beast.'

Just as Baraga had, Gozarin was about to gain great power. But there was no reason for Gadra to wait for that.

"All right. In that case, I will let you be the test subject for my new powers!"

Gadra gleefully looked at Gozarin.

His eyes were those of a scientist looking at a guinea pig.

"Ultimate Gift 'Book of Sorcery (Grimoire)'---Activate!"

The book in Gadra's left hand gave off an ominous glow.

The book contained a number of spells that Rimuru---in other words, Ciel---managed.

Looking at the beautiful formulas in the book, Gadra's face was filled with ecstasy. He then chose the spell that seemed most appropriate for this moment.

"Limited Hellflare^["Ê•µÂ∞èÈªíÁÇéÁçÑ („É™„Éü„ÉÜ„ÉÉ„Éâ„Éò„É´„Éï„É¨„Ç¢)" = Kyokush≈ç kurohomura goku (Rimiteddoherufurea) = Infinitesimal/Minute Black Flame Prison (Limited Hellflare)]."

This was a martial art created by Benimaru but turned into a Skill by Rimuru. Since magic was a type of Skill, it was also mentioned in the 'Grimoire'.

"---What?!"

Although it was not as powerful as the one used by the person who created it, its power was perfect. Gozarin was unable to understand what happened and was burned irreproducible.

"I wish I could have showed off more, but it couldn't be helped."

Gadra muttered, trying to stroke his proud beard. But it was smooth, without even a trace of stubble.

"Oh no! Have I become a young man in appearance? That's troubling. My hair is black. I'll have to dye it...No, I'll use transformation magic to get through this."

Gadra muttered to himself, happily flipping through the 'Grimoire.'


![soft scene break]


In this way, all the leaders of the Magic Beast Corps, led by Gladium, were defeated.

However, there was still danger on the battlefield.

One man was delighted to see Gladium's head lying in front of him.

"There's some tasty looking bait lying around!"

That was the reason for his delight.

The one who took picked up the head without hesitation and devoured it was Vega the Power, one of the heads of Cerberus, who had infiltrated the Magic Beast Corps on Yuuki's orders.

As he devoured Gladium's corpse, Vega's body was filled with power.

His supple body, reminiscent of a carnivore, had grown larger in size. Vega had grown to the point where he could stand alongside Gladium, who had been over two meters tall, and his uniform was puffed up with swollen muscles.

"Hmm, not bad...but it's still not enough."

Vega muttered to himself, but after that, he found more and more delicious-looking food.

There was the charred "Vermillion Bird" Nazim, the dead "Azure Dragon" Baraga with a huge hole in his chest, and the metal remnants of "Black Tortoise" Gozarin which were all that remained.

Sneaking up quietly, Vega devoured his prey one by one, so quickly that no one noticed.

He was able to do this thanks to the power of his Unique Skill 'Evil Eater'---a special power he was born with.

.........

......

...

Vega was born in the royal capital of Ingracia. Unbeknownst to him, Vega was the result of magical inquisitors, who's parent was turned into a monster.

His father, who had taken in so much of the monster factor that he could no longer return, attacked his mother, and Vega was born. Therefore, Vega was born a heretic. He was only in his mother's womb for about three days, and he had an ego from the day he was born.

However, as a baby without reason and without understanding language, he was feared as a monster by his mother and others around him. Instead of being loved, he was almost killed and went into hiding.

Over the next dozen years, Vega survived.

He ate rats, scavenged leftovers, and ate whatever he could to survive. Eventually, he ate a man who was dying after a fight.

And then he understood.

![break]

He was surrounded by so much food.

Vega became a veritable monster, feeding even on humans. Naturally, a subjugation order was issued, but Yuuki was the one in charge of it.

With the help of Shizue Izawa, who was already teaching as an instructor at the time, Yuuki succeeded in capturing Vega.

He should have been executed, but Yuuki thought that Vega's strength was too valuable. He had a great sense of combat, and a strong body. In addition, he thought that Vega had potential for growth and could be used as a useful pawn if trained.

Yuuki tricked Shizu into believing that he had disposed of Vega.

Vega was then trained in the Empire through Damrada. And now, he had grown into a fearsome warrior.

.........

......

...

Fortunately for Vega, the battle between the Devil Chevaliers and Chimera Knights, who came as reinforcements, was getting fiercer. This allowed him to accomplish his goal in a covert manner.

He had the limbs of a mighty beast, a body of hard magisteel, the power of a dragon that could repel magic, and even wings that could fly through the sky. Vega received them all in a short time.

Not only that, but he also picked up the mythical-grade Azure Dragon Spear.

He was not yet recognized as its master, but Vega did not care. He poured all of his strength into making it obey and forcibly fused them together.

It was Gozarin's power---the effect of 'metal manipulation'.

By taking in the mythical-grade weapon, Vega's whole body changed into something even more horrible. The extraordinary armor that covered his entire body made him an unidentifiable majin.

At this point, Gabil and the others noticed.

"What?! There is still such a dangerous majin around?!"

Gabil shouted in surprise, and his subordinates could not help complaining.

"But Gabil-sama, don't we already have our hands full?"

"Indeed."

"We've been fighting battle after battle, and our supplies are running low. What should we do, Gabil-sama?"

It was understandable.

In fact, the Hiryuu's fatigue was nearing its limit.

If the Devil Chevaliers had come even a little later, their battle line would have collapsed long ago.

After all, the Beast Master's Warrior Alliance and the Tensh≈çsh≈´, who were expected to be reliable reinforcements, were the first to leave the front lines.

"Oh no"---Suphia had said back then. And that was just the beginning.

When Gabil asked what was wrong, Suphia replied, "I'm so sleepy."

Upon hearing that, Gabil also understood.

It was happening.

He realized that the evolutionary slumber, an essential part of the Harvest Festival, had started at the worst possible time.

Since Karion and Frey were about to awaken, this was just a natural consequence. There was no point in complaining about this irresistible physiological phenomenon. That is why Gabil and the others struggled alone to protect this place.

The other troops were engaging the enemy at their own discretion. However, Gabil and his subordinates could not move from this place. That is why the fatigue was even more intense.

Gabil's face paled at Vega's appearance.

"Please rest assured, Gabil-dono. I will go talk to him first. He is called Vega, and is one of Yuuki's partners."

How reliable, Gabil was impressed with Gadra.

"I'm counting on you!"

"Leave it to me."

They smiled and nodded at each other, having somehow become friends. Gadra then stepped forward towards Vega.

"Vega, it's been a while."

"Huh? Ah, old man Gadra. I had heard that you turned over to the Demon Lord Rimuru, but it looks like it was true."

"Mm-hmm. That is why I'm in league with Yuuki. It's good to see you here. If it weren't for me, you would be considered an enemy."

"I see."

Gadra approached him in a friendly manner, but Vega gave him a disinterested glance. He quickly averted his gaze.

In Vega's view, there were now people more interesting than Gadra.

In his line of sight were Karion and Frey. Around them, too, he could see tasty-looking food lying around. Vega's mouth was full of drool, and he had an ecstatic expression, imagining the taste of the meat.

"I am going to be the mediator here, and you will assist with---bwah?!"

Vega's fist swatted away Gadra's attempt at a friendly tap on the shoulder. Caught off guard, Gadra took it in stride.

Vega's power had now been strengthened to the point where it surpassed that of an awakened demon lord. Compared to Gadra, his magicule count was more than double.

Even Gadra, who had become a metal demon with excellent physical defense, was no match for Vega, whose entire body was made of magisteel and who had also taken in mythical-grade armament. With a single blow, Gadra's consciousness was snuffed out and he was silenced.

"Ga-Gadra-dono!!"

As he shouted, Gabil thought to himself that Gadra-dono was also an unreliable man. Gadra's confidence had been so strong that it could not be helped.

Gabil was greatly disappointed because his hopes had been crushed. Moreover, Vega's ability was beyond his imagination.

Vega was licking his lips at Karion and Frey, as if he has no intention of hiding it.

His intention was clear.

If they didn't defeat him here, it would only give him more power.

He still didn't know if he could beat him even now, and if that was true, there was nothing he could do about it. There was no doubt that Gabil had no chance of winning, so he had no choice but to do his best here.

*I've always wanted to stand out, but it's no use if it happens this way.*

Gabil was feeling a little sorry for himself as he self-reflected.


![soft scene break]


Gabil was about to step forward, but he stopped when someone stood in front of him.

"Gabil-san, leave this to me."

"A-Ah! Aren't you Laplace-dono? What are you doing here?"

"That's---"

Laplace almost replied that he was left behind by everyone else, but then he fell silent. He realized that saying it would be awkward.

"There's no need to say it. I'm here to save you!"

"O-Oh, wow!! That's so reassuring, Laplace-dono!"

"Yeah. Now that I'm here, there's no need to worry."

Laplace forced the conversation to a conclusion. Then, he turned to Vega, who was supposed to be his comrade.

"So, Vega-san. Why did you hit old man Gadra?"

Laplace asked Vega as he twirled around lightly. Vega, looking annoyed at Laplace, answered in a troublesome manner.

"Huh? It's obvious, isn't it? It's because that old man was trying to get in my way."

"In your way?"

"Yeah, that's right. Anyone who tries to interfere with my meal shouldn't be allowed to live. So, Laplace, why don't you just stay out of it? Then I'll let you off the hook for old times sake."

Laplace stopped twirling around.

"That's a funny joke you're making. You haven't forgotten your place now, have you?"

The tone of his voice was almost the same as before. However, the atmosphere was so tense that it was no exaggeration to say that something had shifted.

But Vega didn't care.

"Hah, my position? You're the one who's in no position to give me orders! I heard that Yuuki lost to Rudra. I only listen to orders from people who are stronger than me."

As soon as he said that, Vega started laughing loudly.

The sound of his laughter echoed across the battlefield.

"I can't laugh. Your jokes are not funny."

"It's not a joke---Kwa?!"

The vulgar laughter suddenly stopped.

In an instant, Laplace closed the distance and grabbed Vega by the neck.

![full page image](image5)

"Don't underestimate people, or I'll kick your ass."

Laplace lifted up the body which was more than twice his size.

Vega struggled, his arms and legs jerking around. He no longer needed to breathe, but he was confused because he wasn't used to it yet.

That's when Laplace unleashed a knee strike that exploded against Vega. Vega, who had been grabbed by the neck, had no way to escape even if he was pulled back. As Laplace loosened his grip, Vega cowered in place, trying to catch his breath.

"W-wait, wait. I'm sorry I got carried away. I've cooled down now, so please forgive me."

Laplace was about to kick Vega in the head but stopped when he saw Vega pleading. Then, in a cold voice, he spoke.

"---I'm not as nice as the boss. Don't expect a second chance."

"I-I understand."

"Then, you'll have to follow me like an adult. Well, if you do anything, I'll have no choice but to stop you."

Vega nodded his head.

"Got it. So, what's the plan now?"

"I'm going to go where the President is. As long as the President is saved, Teare and Footman will be back to normal. Anyway, if we don't find a solution, we'll never get the boss out. So, don't get ahead of yourself."

"I understand."

Vega nodded widely at Laplace's words. His desperate attitude suggested that he was scared of Laplace.

Seeing Vega that way, Laplace let out a sigh of relief.

"Is this going to be okay?"

Gadra, who had just gotten up, muttered worriedly.

"Old man!"

Vega stared at him while postured.

"Oh, Gadra-dono! You're safe!"

Gabil was surprised but happy.

"As expected, so the old man was safe?"

Laplace was not surprised, as if he had been expecting this.

"Of course. I was unconscious for a moment, but I'm well prepared for an emergency evacuation. I was pretending to be attacked, hoping to catch you off guard and cast a massive spell on you."

In fact, the Ultimate Gift 'Grimoire' had 'Thought Acceleration' and 'Parallelism' as a matter of course. By using these features, even if he lost conscious, another back-up thought will take over.

"I see. I was fooled, too."

"You're great old man, seriously."

"Well. I haven't lived this long in vain. More importantly, the problem is Vega."

Laplace tried to dodge the subject, but Gadra was having none of it.

"Me?"

"That's right. I'm afraid I can't trust you."

"Why not?!"

Vega began acting like he couldn't understand.

Laplace couldn't help but be amazed by this.

He shrugged his shoulders and replied as if to remind them.

"To be honest, I don't trust him either. But this guy is also one of ours. I know you think we should kill him, but I want to believe in him. Besides, we can't do anything without the boss's permission. If he becomes too much next time, we will listen to you. Let's see if we can forgive him for once and give him a chance to be trusted."

It was a headache, Laplace thought bitterly.

Vega was too stupid.

He's too loyal to his own desires, and he wasn't good at reading the atmosphere. But that didn't mean he didn't have his good points. He was not the type who worked best in a group, but he obeyed orders to a certain extent.

Besides, he was strong. It would be a waste of resources to get rid of him here.

Although he was worried that his occasional problematic behavior might exceed the acceptable range... Laplace thought that he should accompany and take care of him.

This time, too, it had ended in an attempt, but it had been a step closer to a big problem.

If he had messed with Karion and the others, Laplace would have taken action against Vega without protecting him.

To be honest, even if it was only an attempt, it was still a serious matter...

"I don't have the authority to make decisions, but I understand how you feel. I'm not a stranger after all, and as long as you don't cause trouble for Rimuru-sama, it's fine."

Gadra was also someone who knew Vega. He thought it would be inappropriate for him to speak here, so he only gave a conservative opinion.

"I'm worried about that too..."

Laplace was also worried, but it was said in a slurred voice.

Gabil was the only one who laughed out loud.

"Gwahahaha! A man can learn a lot from his mistakes. All right. I will choose to believe in you too! Vega, as you've said, listen to Laplace-dono well and become a great warrior!"

With that, Gabil clapped Vega on the back.

![break]

Despite his misgivings, now was not the time to stop and worry.

Laplace walked away quickly, taking Vega with him.

"Was that the right thing to do?"

"No problem. If Vega grows, it will be profitable, and if he fails, Laplace-dono will take the blame."

"...You've got a darker streak in your heart than I thought."

"Gwahahaha! I won't get anything in return despite your praise!"

Gadra thought that he wasn't praising him, but it was too much trouble to say, so he kept silent.

The atmosphere relaxed a bit, but they were still in the middle of a battle.

Remembering this, they tried to change their minds and face the battle.

That's when the good news came in.

"Brother! Moss-dono has informed me that Rimuru-sama has defeated Velgrynd-sama. It seems that the executives have boarded the enemy airship and are now engaged in a decisive battle with the main force of the enemy. We can't afford to lose!"

Souka, who had returned to the front after a break, reported the current situation with a loud voice. As a result, the morale of Rimuru's forces rose significantly.

On the contrary, the Imperial Army was in turmoil.

Aside from those who had lost their will and were running rampant, the Chimera Knights who had been the core of the force, realized how bad of a situation they were in.

They had lost their commander and could not expect any more reinforcements. And yet, the enemy reinforcements keep increasing, and it was hopeless to defeat the enemy commander.

If they insisted on defeating the ex-demon lord who had shown his weakness on the battlefield, they would probably be surrounded and annihilated.

If someone had been in control, it would have been a different story.

But, as it was, there was no commander.

It was natural for some of them to run away, thinking that things would not go well.

On the contrary, Rimuru's subordinates were overjoyed.

"Uoooooo, as expected of His Majesty Rimuru!"

"H-He defeated Velgrynd-sama?! I can't believe it, but I guess it should be expected of Rimuru-sama!!"

"He's won. From here on, it's time to overrun the battle!"

Of course, Gabil and Gadra were no exception.

"How wonderful! After all, Rimuru-sama is of a different class!"

"Well, yes. I've been wondering about him as well since I suddenly became so strong. That voice must be related to Rimuru-sama after all, as Diablo-sama had surmised..."

"Did you say something, Gadra-dono?"

"No, it's nothing. Rather, let us finish our work."

Prying too much would only get himself killed. Gadra was well aware of this, so he decided not to pursue the matter too deeply. Another reason was that he thought it would be a bad idea to get Gabil involved.

Gabil nodded at Gadra's words.

Gabil turned his thoughts to the battlefield and gave the order to charge with the loudest voice of the day.
