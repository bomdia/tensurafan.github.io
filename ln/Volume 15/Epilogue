# Epilogue: Brother|and Sister

After "eating" Velgrynd, I calmed down. Now that I had some time to look around, I took a look around the battleground.

The Jura forest was badly damaged, but the capital city of Rimuru had escaped destruction. The area around the city had been cleared and some damage had been done, but Geld and his men seemed to have kept it safe.

I was relieved.

"So, what are you still doing here?"

"Well, isn't it fine, Rimuru-sama? In fact, I am here to make sure no one gets in Rimuru-sama's way..."

I had noticed that he had been watching ME the entire time I was Velgrynd. To be honest, it was annoying, but I didn't have time to pay attention at the time. And now, here we are at the present. It was only natural that I would complain.

"Come on, everyone else is working hard. So you go do your job."

"?! Ah, I-I understand..."

After looking at me with sad eyes, Diablo left.

This guy, I really can't figure out how he thinks.

![break]

<<He must have been watching the battle under the guise of guarding the Rimuru-sama and to prevent any external interventions---frankly, it was unnecessary.>>

![break]

It seems that even Ciel-san was tired of Diablo. Her words were more scathing than ever. In any case, now I could get back to dealing with Velgrynd.

I decided to leave all the explaining and convincing to Veldora, however...

![break]

...As I listened, I found out that Veldora was putting all of the blame onto me.

*Oi oi, how come it's always me who has to deal with all these problem children?!*---I was annoyed.

This guy seems to be trying to portray me as the bad guy so that he could deflect Velgrynd's anger.

"...Anyway, that's why I wanted to tell my sister that I was safe, but Rimuru wouldn't let me. Now that you are in the same position, you will understand what I am saying, won't you?"

---And just like that he was selling me out.

He's like that spoiled child who blames his friends when he doesn't want anyone to get angry at him.

It was a mistake to let Veldora do the persuasion. But he had a point. I could understand that it would be embarrassing for him to show up out of nowhere in front of his sister, who was furious thinking he was dead.

I could understand that feeling, but what's all this about blaming me? Isn't that just forcing more trouble on me?

He was supposed to help mediate, not make the situation worse for me. A-Ah, this is no good! I can't leave Veldora in charge any longer. I needed to explain that Velgrynd's current position was the same as Veldora's.

![break]

<<Before that, I have something to report.>>

![break]

What is it?

![break]

<<Upon analyzing Velgrynd, I have discovered that she was under the control of someone, possibly Rudra. I can remove that effect if you want. How do you want to proceed?>>

![break]

H-hey, that's a bombshell of a statement!

I'm not sure how to respond to that report. I had thought Ciel-san would have done the 'Analyze and Assess' on Velgrynd, so I was not too surprised about that, but I just couldn't keep quiet after hearing that Velgrynd had been controlled. By the way, was Rudra really the culprit?

![break]

<<Almost confirmed. In addition, I have observed the battle between Carrera and Tatsuya Kondou through the Soul Corridor and it seems that Kondou was also controlled by Rudra. I would guess that this is a similar situation.>>

![break]

When I asked for the details, I was told that Granit, the guy Benimaru was fighting, even gave him those answers.

That guy was an idiot. I think it was necessary to make it a good example for everyone to learn. That said, it was a problem to be solved after I returned home. The current problem at hand was what to do with Velgrynd.

It has been proven that Veldora is unreliable. That's why I was going to explain it to her, but if Rudra's Mental Control is affecting her, there is a big possibility that she won't listen to me.

Now then, what to do...

![break]

<<Since we've taken the trouble, how about we put Velgrynd in the same position as Veldora?>>

![break]

Huh?

Does that mean you can connect me to Velgrynd with Soul Corridor like Veldora, and turn her into an Ultimate Skill?

Is that even possible?

![break]

<<No problem. The current Rimuru-sama is equal to or greater than the True Dragon race and has plenty of magicules. It is possible to take in Velgrynd.>>

![break]

But if I do that, I might be taking away Velgrynd's free will...or would I?

I was unable to actually force Veldora to do anything. When I asked him for a favor, he had to agree to work with me. Rather, Veldora just does whatever he wants. When he wants to protect himself, he is willing to sell me out, as he is doing right now. Although I would have sentenced him to confiscation of snacks at such a time, when I think about it, he really does give me a hard time.

Even if he did something detrimental to me, it was impossible to undo his released state. I suppose I could stop the energy supply, but I couldn't make Veldora disappear. Moreover, the amount of magicules that a True Dragon had was so large that it could not be lost by mere chance. As long as Veldora did not return of his own accord, he was free to do whatever he liked. In other words, there was no coercive force. Basically, when Veldora was free, I couldn't force him to do anything.

Thinking about it this way, I realized that Velgrynd would be in the same situation. If I put her in the same position as Veldora, and then 'free' Velgrynd, it would be a quick way to prove my innocence. I wouldn't be misunderstood any more, and I wouldn't get caught in the crossfire.

Sibling quarrels? I don't know anything. That kind of thing is not my area of expertise. In that case, let's put her in the same state as Veldora.

![break]

<<If you're not sure, do you want to put some restrictions on Velgrynd?>>

![break]

Hmmm? Restrictions, is that even possible...?

Putting restrictions on Velgrynd so that she can't resist may be necessary for the future. But...that went against my principles. Worst of all, if Velgrynd was not convinced, it would have been better to leave her in Isolation in Imaginary Space. If I put a mandatory condition on her, I would become the same as Rudra.

Even if she doesn't want to help me, that's fine. As long as she promises to stay out of my way, she can go live her life.

![break]

<<Understood. I think that's only fitting for Rimuru-sama.>>

![break]

The plan was set. And it was time to get to work. First, I would start with a greeting.

"Ah, Velgrynd-san. How are you---?"

"You, Rimuru?! Quit messing around! Let me out of here now!!"

I turned my attention into my 'Imaginary Space', and Velgrynd began to rampage.

If you pictured the scene, it would be like a suspicious slime approaching a beautiful woman. Indeed, quite the criminal. That slime was me---er, now in human form. No, this was... It was now a beautiful girl of about 16 years old who was approaching a beautiful woman. The atmosphere was rather bewitching, but it couldn't be helped. This was also to prove my innocence.

In the image, I held out my hand to Velgrynd. Then I ate Rudra's influence, released it, and established the 'Soul Corridor.' There were doors on both sides, so unless Velgrynd opened her heart, she could not communicate with me. I could talk to her, so I didn't think it was a waste of time. These tasks were completed without any problems.

Velgrynd, who had been rampaging, had quieted down, and I was surprised by the sudden change.

"Ri-Rimuru? You didn't do something unscrupulous to my sister, did you...?"

"You idiot! Of course not! In fact, if you had persuaded her properly, I wouldn't have had to go through all this trouble!!"

We were about to start a fight, but then...

"Shut up!"

"Ah, yes."

"I'm sorry!"

There was a sudden loud cry and Veldora and I lowered our heads at the same time.

To be honest, I was scared. No wonder Veldora found her so difficult to deal with.

"What the hell is the meaning of this, Rimuru?"

"Even if you ask, I'm not sure what you mean..."

I had no idea what she was talking about.

"I can hear my Split Body's voice over there, but these sounds don't seem to reach there. What the hell did you do?"

A very pretty woman looked into my face, and I got nervous. I could feel her breath on my face and I began to feel faint. She smelled really good. Velgrynd's breath was so sweetly fragrant, perhaps because she didn't normally need to breathe.

![break]

<<Now is not the time. Velgrynd's doubts were probably due to the fact that she has been freed from Rudra's control.>>

![break]

Are you a little angry?

![break]

<<It's just your imagination.>>

![break]

Is that so?

But, well, I decided not to pursue it too deeply, and got an explanation from Ciel-san. According to it, the story was simple. The Velgrynd in front of me was not under Rudra's control while the 'Split Body' over there was. That's why I was using the Infinite Prison to block the flow of information.

When blocking out information, one can only get information from the other side. As a result, the Velgrynd on the other side was in a trapped state. Under Rudra's control, she still couldn't understand what I was thinking. It was a one-way street.

I understood that Ciel-san was doing amazing things, but I was no longer surprised.

"In other words, if we analyze the difference in consciousness, we can prove that you were being controlled."

"As expected of Rimuru. Sister, let's trust Rimuru here---"

"Shut up!"

"Yes!!"

Veldora, who had interjected, was being disciplined again and secretly, I did feel a little happy to see that.

After shouting at Veldora, Velgrynd seemed to be thinking about something. She was probably trying to figure out the difference between what I said and the 'Split Body' over there.

I, too, looked through the eyes of my companions and grasped the situation on the flagship. The battle was in its final stages. And something had just happened that would confirm Velgrynd's suspicions.


![soft scene break]


My friends were surrounding Velgrynd. This may have seemed a bit cowardly, but that was only for those who were not familiar with the situation. In reality, even if Velgrynd was in a weakened state, it would be difficult to win even if they all challenged her at once. Be that as it may, the foreign space created by Velgrynd was torn apart and about to collapse. Just when I thought it was about to collapse, Diablo came and destroyed it with ease.

"The Black Primordial..."

"That's Diablo. He'd be pretty capable if I wasn't watching."

"Kuahahaha! That guy gives me his snacks. I like him."

This guy has been bought off. So I can't believe every compliment that Veldora showers on Diablo.

With that in mind, as I watched the situation, I saw Velgrynd take a step back to protect Rudra. Rudra remained in his chair with a relaxed attitude despite the situation. That was some nerve. Or was it confidence? Seeing Rudra like this, there was one person who moved first. Carrera. With the golden pistol in her hand, she shot Rudra without hesitation.

Moreover, that bullet---

"That's the move that weakened me, isn't it?"

"'Judgment'. If Kondou can only shoot the strongest bullet once a day, how can the Yellow Primordial...?"

I knew the details because Ciel-san had told me.

"Not the Yellow Primordial, but Carrera. Apparently, she won the battle against Kondou and was entrusted with defeating Rudra."

"I didn't expect even Kondou..." muttered Velgrynd after I explained.

Leaving the confused Velgrynd behind, the situation moved on.

<Rudra!> shouted the other Velgrynd, she stood in front of Rudra with her arms outstretched as if to protect him. The fact that she was able to reach Rudra in time with a bullet of divine speed showed that her physical abilities were monstrous. However, the 'Judgment' was not half as powerful. Upon hitting, it blew off Velgrynd's right arm from the shoulder and hit Rudra without diminishing its power.

However...

Surprisingly, Rudra was unharmed.

His expression was relaxed, as if he had known that Carrera's attack would be in vain.

"What was that? How was he able to neutralize that attack?"

"I don't know. I saw a glimpse of the 'Barrier', but I don't believe it was capable of completely nullifying it."

Veldora and I were surprised by the sight. Velgrynd couldn't believe it either, muttering, *"Why...?"* as she collapsed to the ground supported herself with both hands.

"What's going on, Sister?!"

Velgrynd replied in a small voice to the panicked Veldora.

"Your friend was right. I really was under Rudra's control..."

Realizing this, Velgrynd told me about Rudra. She said that Rudra was safe because of his ironclad defense. That defense was absolute and could not be destroyed by anybody no matter what. However, there was a condition. The loyalty of the subjects and subordinates to the emperor was the source of energy, and there had to be people who were loyal to the Emperor. And then there was a drawback. Although this defense was perfect and always active, it restricted all other actions while it was active while it was active. This ability was the pride of the Ultimate Skill 'Justice King Michael', the 'Castle Guard'.

As we could see from the fact that it had deflected Carrera's Judgment, it was almost invincible. The Skill's user could not attack while it was in use, but those matters could be left to his subordinates.

"If he had that kind of power, he wouldn't have needed my sister to protect him!"

Yes, I thought so too.

"Yes," Velgrynd answered. "That's why the right thing for me to do would have been to pretend to protect him and then go on the offensive. But the fact that I acted like that..."

Velgrynd finally understood that she was being 'thought guided' when she saw herself pushing to defend Rudra. And Rudra, on the other hand, maintained the absolute 'Castle Guard' and did not make a move.

That's how it was supposed to---

"What?!" Velgrynd shouted in surprise.

And we were all in shock.

This was because Rudra had instantly released the 'Castle Guard' and pierced through Velgrynd's chest even as she rushed towards him upon losing her right arm. It was as if Rudra had deliberately attacked Velgrynd.

"I see, so that's how it is...that person, my beloved Rudra, is gone..."

Tears spilled from Velgrynd's eyes. As if to prove Velgrynd's sorrowful words, Rudra laughed loudly.

"Hahahahaha! Velgrynd, you should be honored to be of service to me. I'll put your power to good use."

As soon as Rudra said that, Velgrynd on the other side crouched down in pain.

"That's Yuuki's 'Steal Life', isn't it? Rudra---no, the 'Justice King Michael' also has the ability to freely use the Skills of the targets under his control."

What? That should be illegal.

Upon hearing Velgrynd's explanation, Veldora and I looked at each other.

"I'll leave you to deal with Rudra!"

"Don't be stupid! I have no need to argue that I am the best, but I don't want any trouble, so forgive me for refusing!"

"I'll make you a parfait."

"That's tempting, but...Hnnng."

Velgrynd looked at us in disgust as we squabbled. Perhaps that was why her tears seemed to have receded. Needless to say, I thought it was a good thing.

Well, that and...

About the Rudra who had taken Velgrynd's power...

"What do you mean by 'Rudra is Justice King Michael'?" I had an idea, but I asked that question since I wanted to hear it from Velgrynd herself.

"Rudra was already at his limit. He had been reincarnated so many times that his soul was worn out. That's why it's Rudra yet not Rudra. He was replaced by the 'Justice King' long ago." Velgrynd replied sadly.

"No, no, no, a Skill born of the master's desire cannot harm the master himself."

"No, that's not it. Rudra's 'Justice King Michael' was a power given to him by Veldanava. The Skill actually earned by Rudra by his own will was 'Covenant King Uriel'. Now that Veldanava, our brother, has still not returned, it is lost and unaccounted for."

"..."

I have it though?

It wasn't the right atmosphere to say that, so I decided to just keep quiet.

Velgrynd continued with her explanation. To sum it up, she said that Rudra's repeated reincarnations had weakened his soul's power, and that he had become unable to control the 'Justice King Michael'.

When I heard about this, it came to my mind that rather than a Skill betraying its host, this could be seen in a different way.

![break]

<<Indeed. If I were in the same position as the 'Justice King Michael', I would aim for the revival of my true Master, even if I had to take control of the temporary host.>>

![break]

That's what I thought.

I felt that Ciel, as a Manas, would never give up, no matter how impossible the challenge might be. That is why I couldn't' help but understand the thoughts of 'Justice King Michael'.

However, that didn't mean...

"This can't be left unattended. The 'Justice King Michael' has probably evolved into a free-willed Manas. If that's the case, then its purpose of action must be completely different from what Rudra was aiming for."

"Manas? What the hell is... I mean, wait, wait! Rimuru, do you think that the 'Justice King Michael' is after something?"

Since I was asked, I would answer.

"Isn't it the resurrection of Veldanava? I'm sure it's willing to make all kinds of sacrifices to achieve that goal."

'So, we can't just leave it alone there', I explained.

Velgrynd's face paled.

At that moment, a new figure appeared and launched an attack on Velgrynd, who was currently facing Rudra.

![break]

<<That is Phantom King Feldway, isn't it? He was overlooked because it was decided that Diablo could not defeat him, but it seems that he left his friends behind and came back.>>

![break]

If Diablo couldn't defeat him, he must be a very strong man. Still, it always felt like Diablo just wanted to slack off, or was it just my imagination?

Never mind.

Feldway, just like a powerful foe, was attacking Velgrynd with 'Spatial Domination' which was difficult for even an awakened demon lord to resist. The wounded and weakened Velgrynd did not seem to have the strength left to resist it.

![break]

"Fuhahahaha! That Velgrynd has disappeared from this world through Space-Time Transfer!! Now, there are only two True Dragons left. It's a good start, Rudra---No, Michael-sama."

Feldway called Rudra "Michael" again. It seemed that Velgrynd's guess had been proven true.

Despite the suddenness of the event, Benimaru and Diablo tried to react quickly. However, I hurriedly performed a 'Telepathy Net' and stopped them. It was partly because Phantom King Feldway was unfathomable, but also because I wanted to see how Rudra would react to being called Michael.

What's more---I could see it. I could see a strange substance slipping out of Rudra's body. It was clinging to Velgrynd as if it was trying to protect itself. And now, it seemed that all of that strange substance had disappeared from Rudra's body.

Really, this reaction is...

"Hmm, not bad. Velgrynd's power became an afterthought, and Rudra disappeared. Now all we have to do is harness the power of Veldora and Velzard and his resurrection will be complete."

Rudra, who was now called Michael, accepted this as a matter of course. Now it was confirmed. My enemy was not Rudra, but Michael. And his goal was the complete revival of Veldanava, the Star King Dragon.

"This is a good thing, Michael-sama."

"Hmm. Velzard can be dealt with, but it's Veldora that's troublesome."

And so their conversation continued. It was as if they didn't care about Benimaru and the others. But that was to be expected.

Shion and Testarossa, who were not stopped, attacked simultaneously, but all of their attacks were blocked by the Castle Guard. Naturally, Feldway was also unharmed since he was protected as well.

How very troublesome. But that wasn't the point right now.

"Rudra, th-that's Rudra, right? The fragments---the pieces of his soul are still there!!"

I thought I was the only one who could see it, but Velgrynd seems to have sensed it too. I had wondered if she could see them, but it appeared that Velgrynd was planning to track down what was left of Rudra.

"Calm down---"

"Shut up! If we don't get over there soon, the pieces are going to disappear!!"

It was like she had become a spoiled child, crying and screaming despite her angry expression. I prolonged the time by using 'Thought Acceleration'. Then, Velgrynd and I created our own world.

"Calm down, please. If you go out now, you'll just end up under Rudra's control again."

"But!"

I'm sure you know what you're doing. But beyond that, you'll be stuck there. With no guarantee of returning to this world, saving Rudra is a pipe dream. Perhaps it's even impossible.

![break]

<<If you continue to act like this, you'll have no future.>>

![break]

"Shut up! So...what do you want me to do? I can't give up on Rudra like this, I can't!!"

Those were Velgrynd's true feelings.

It was Ciel's voice, not mine, but she hadn't noticed it and had exploded with a passion.

![break]

<<The possibility is still there.>>

![break]

"---Wha?!"

![break]

<<If you accept my 'Skill Alteration'.>>

![break]

It was a sweet temptation. It was no longer even necessary to wait for the answer.

"I accept. As long as it makes my wish come true."

It seemed only natural to me that Velgrynd should answer that way.

.........

......

...

The moment Velgrynd agreed, a voice echoed out.

![break]

<<Velgrynd's will has been confirmed. The first thing to do is cut off the interference with 'Charity King Raguel'.>>

![break]

As she listened, Velgrynd calmed down. She examined her own body deeply, guided by the voice, and found that she had indeed found it. There were traces of some kind of interference with the 'Charity King Raguel' engraved deep in her heart. It was blocked now, but it was definitely dangerous to leave it there.

*So this was the cause.*

Velgrynd also understood. At the same time, she remembered. The Ultimate Skill 'Justice King Michael' had a counterpart to the Regalia Dominion. It was a memory she remembered hearing a long time ago.

Among the powers created by Veldanava, the ones more pure were called the angelic system, and all of them were subject to the absolute control of the 'Justice King Michael'. This was the 'Ultimate Dominion'. Velgrynd's 'Charity King Raguel' was no exception. A very narrow corridor had been constructed to connect it to Justice King Michael, and there was no escaping its influence.

*That's right, how could I have forgotten? The Ultimate Skill holders of the angelic lineage could not go against my brother. He hated it more than anyone else, and that's why he traded Rudra's 'Covenant King Uriel' for it.*

It also made sense why she had been dominated. If her brother Veldanava had built the system, it would be nearly impossible for her to resist.

*Indeed, I have no future...*

Rimuru was right, Velgrynd felt like crying.

But then... Just as Velgrynd was about to give up, she heard a strange voice.

![break]

<<The preparations for the 'Charity King Raguel' have been completed. It will be integrated with the no-longer-needed 'Covenant King Uriel'.>>

![break]

Huh?!

Velgrynd almost screamed. It was only natural that she would act this way. The 'Covenant King Uriel' that she and Rudra had been looking for was found in such a place. Or rather, Velgrynd had just now noticed. The voice she had been hearing was not Rimuru's. It was not a simple auditory hallucination, but a clear and powerful voice of will. It was very similar to the 'Voice of the World', but softer and more refined, with a feeling of tenderness.

There were many things she wanted to ask, but what she needed to ask now was the meaning of its words.

"Wait, wait, wait! You're giving me the 'Covenant King Uriel'? Or rather, what do you mean by 'integrated'?!"

![break]

<<If you have no choice but to follow the 'Justice King Michael' as it is, then you can stop the alteration. I found a control circuit in the Covenant King Uriel, so I decided to use it as an inspiration to create a new Skill just for you while discarding it.>>

![break]

That was absurd. It was seriously an answer that anyone would spit-take on.

But all Velgrynd cared about was one question.

"If you do that, then I can go find Rudra, right?"

![break]

<<Yes, that is possible.>>

![break]

If it was possible, then there was no need to hesitate. Velgrynd agreed with hope in her heart. No, it had already been promised.

![break]

<<Velgrynd, your intentions have been confirmed, so there is no need for a second acceptance. I will now activate 'Skill Alteration'.>>

![break]

That voice---Ciel had no intention of stopping. The moment Ciel activated 'Skill Alteration', an unbelievable surge of power rushed through Velgrynd's body.

Then, it gently enveloped her entire body.

![break]

<<Scorch Dragon Velgrynd's 'Charity King Raguel' and 'Covenant King Uriel' will be integrated and evolved into the Ultimate Skill 'Divine Flame King Cthugha'... Successful.>>

![break]

In a fantastical and solemn voice, Ciel announced in high spirits.

And in that moment, Velgrynd was freed from all bondage.

.........

......

...

Just as I was nodding my head to Ciel's words, my 'Covenant King Uriel' was transferred out.

It was my fault for giving permission, but needless to say, I was stunned.

Covenant King Uriel' had been the culmination of the bonds I had with my comrades...

![break]

<<No problem. What was integrated into 'Charity King Raguel' was merely the residue of 'Covenant King Uriel'. Its essence has been inherited by the new power of 'Harvest King Shub-Niggurath'.>>

![break]

---Eh?!

I have so many questions. I have a feeling that Ciel-sensei is up to a lot of great things without my knowledge. I was too afraid to ask, but the thing I needed to focus on now was Velgrynd. I was glad to hear she made it.

"Congratulations, Velgrynd-san. Now it's safe to let you out." When I said this with a smile, she glared at me with a fierce expression. It wasn't that I didn't have an idea why, so I gently looked away.

"There are many, many things I really want to ask you, but not now. So, are you going to let me go now?"

I nodded because there no longer seemed to be a problem.

Ciel said that giving Velgrynd the 'Covenant King Uriel' had made her responsive to Rudra's soul, so finding and retrieving the soul fragments would no longer be impossible. When I heard that, I thought to myself. Perhaps the residue that Ciel was referring to was the core of Rudra's heart, the 'Covenant King Uriel'. If so, then Velgrynd had always been with Rudra.

I wasn't sure if one could find Rudra's soul, which was scattered all over the world, but I had a feeling that Velgrynd would be able to do it.

"Well then, let's 'release' you for now!"

And just like that, the three of us came back from the spiritual world to the present world. We said our goodbyes, still feeling the lingering of time.

"Thank you, Rimuru. I'm sorry for all the trouble."

It really was. There was so much I wanted to complain about too! However, I was afraid of upsetting her, so I kept quiet.

"Now that you're connected by the Parallel Existence, I don't think you have to worry about getting lost. I know it's going to be difficult after that, but good luck!"

I kept my support to a safe level.

But then...

"Sister, even if it doesn't work out, I'm here! So, don't be sad and just do your best!" Veldora said with a big smile.

His ability to say anything no matter the atmosphere was very impressive.

It seems that Velgrynd was not sure how to react to this. And her answer was---

"You really are an idiot. Stupid, stupid, cute little brother. I'm glad you're okay."

With that said, Velgrynd smiled shyly. Then, for some reason, she stared at me again. Being seen super close by beautiful women made me too nervous to move a muscle. Seeing my deer-in-headlights expression, she shook her head in exasperation.

"I'll see you later, then."

And with that, Velgrynd departed with a valiant 'Transport.'


![soft scene break]


There you have it.

The next thing was to support Benimaru and the others.

"Are you coming too?"

"Of course I am."

Less than a minute later. The attack on Michael was still going on. It was not good enough to get through the Castle Guard, but it was still the right thing to do. This was because the moment you stop attacking, the enemy would start their own. It was also why Benimaru and Diablo were watching from the sidelines instead of stopping Shion and the others.

There were only two enemies.

I was tempted to take them down here, but unfortunately that was not possible because as long as the Castle Guard was in place, an attack on Michael would not work.

But then again, the conditions are the same for everyone---

"Fuhahahaha! How weak. Your attacks won't work against Michael-sama."

Feldway, smiling broadly, was trying to activate his powers in between the attacks. It seems that the Phantom King was not exaggerating, and he intended to throw all of my companions out into the void at once.

"Goodbye, everyone. I doubt we'll be seeing each other again, but---what?!"

I was also aiming for the moment the attack went off. In order to interrupt Feldway, I appeared on the battlefield.

"Demon Lord Rimuru..."

"Nice to meet you. Phantom King Feldway-san."

![full page image](image9)

The smile faded from his face when I replied sarcastically.

"A small-town hick with no manners."

"Ah? I don't want to hear that from Aggressor-san, who's always longed to be in the city."

When I provoked him further, his expression became a blank mask.

I guess he was the type who didn't get riled up and accumulated his anger calmly. They were the most troublesome type of opponent to deal with.

At that moment, Michael, who had been silently listening to our conversation, intervened in a relaxed manner.

"Huhuhu, weren't you hiding and observing me? I thought you were looking for a way to sacrifice your friends and escape."

He was more than half correct, but I wasn't about to sacrifice my friends. Well, whatever.

"I don't care what you think. Let's just get this over with, shall we?"

"Hmph, you're a bold man, but do you really think you can beat me?"

"Who knows? But I'll give you some advice. I understand that your authority is absolute control over the Angelic Skills, and that one cannot break through the Castle Guard as long as there are people who believe in you. There's no more to say. Don't you think that if we turn the empire into a scorched earth and kill every last living thing, you would lose your advantage?"

This was complete bluffing. I had no intention of going that far. However, if I had to weigh the sacrifices of my comrades to this, I would do it without hesitation. I was already prepared for it a long time ago.

"...It seems I have underestimated you too. Should we not be enemies?"

"You're right. Noble ideals and noble missions have nothing to do with me. I can actually sympathize with some of your goals. That's why, as long as you don't interfere with me, you can do whatever you want."

Although it was too late now.

Now that Michael had gone out of control, he would no doubt bring us calamity.

It was still okay for now, but Ciel predicted that there would inevitably be conflicts of interest in the future. In that case, all I had to do was believe it and act accordingly.

"..."

Michael was silent, perhaps pondering. In that case, I decided to tell him my intentions.

"If you try to hurt me or my people, I will crush you so badly that you'll never be able to do anything foolish again."

I would strike fear into their hearts.

Indeed, I certainly had no way to break the Castle Guard currently. However, I did have my trusty sidekick Ciel. I knew it would find a way to defeat it.

What's more---

I would show no mercy to those who laid a hand on my precious friends. I would defeat Michael no matter what it took---I swore to myself.

"I see. Then let's leave for now."

"---Nn?! Is that all right with you, Michael-sama?" Feldway asked in surprise, but Michael nodded humbly, indicating his intention to withdraw.

"It's too early to tell, and we are the same. If we fight here, it's going to end badly for both of us."

I felt the same way.

With the means I just mentioned, it was indeed possible to win. But that also went against my principles. I could not deny that I was postponing the problem, but for now, I really just wanted to buy time.

"Well then, I guess we're done for today. Shall we?"

"All right. Having said that...on a day that we should have been celebrating our complete resurrection, we've been given an unexpected challenge. I had thought that Guy Crimson would be the biggest obstacle, but it turns out that this slime, whom I thought was insignificant, is..."

With that said, Michael and Feldway left. They probably weren't going to the Empire. There was no response to my surveillance spell, Argus. And Moss reported nothing unusual.

"How awful, really. I don't even know where they went."

Benimaru laughed.

"But Rimuru-sama, as you ordered, everyone is safe. Now let's celebrate that and go home."

I suppose that's correct.

"Well then, let's go home! I'm already tired today and quite hungry. Why don't we ask Shuna to prepare some delicious meals for us?"

"A banquet, huh?"

That also sounded good.

I nodded back at Veldora.

"Let's go home and have a banquet!"

My words put the smiles back on everyone's faces.

Even though we still had much work to do, we were grateful that we could celebrate our success together.

Velgrynd continued her journey. Yesterday, today, and tomorrow. She tirelessly moved forward.

.........

......

...

At that time, she had left Rimuru and flew to a different world that transcended time. It was in an unknown crevice of another world where she safely reunited with her 'Parallel Existence', which had managed to escape Feldway.

That place had no atmosphere or even earth, Velgrynd was forced to drift around without any sense of time. Had Velgrynd not been a True Dragon, she might have died in that place. But she had 'Spatial Domination' and an infinite lifespan.

She had plenty of time to think before she reached the place where she could stop. Velgrynd had almost stopped thinking because of the unbelievable events that had happened to her.

The amount of information exceeded her processing capacity. The emergency of being adrift in a different space, on the other hand, allowed her to regain her composure.

Velgrynd thought to herself. The sheer volume of information and its anomalies had made her give up thinking, but she thought for as long as she could. Then, more than anything else, she thought of one thing. The fundamental question was how Velgrynd had been able to regain her freedom, going against the system constructed by her own brother.

There was only one person she could think of who could have made this possible.

That aberration of a slime, an ally of her foolish brother---Demon Lord Rimuru.

*N-No way, it can't be?! That slime...*

He had freely altered an Ultimate Skill, giving Velgrynd her freedom and greatly improving her abilities to an even higher level. This was not something that could be done by someone normal.

*Only my brother Veldanava could do such a thing. If there was another being capable of such an act, I can't imagine it...*

Velgrynd shuddered at the thought of the impossible. Turning her attention to it, the Ultimate Skill 'Divine Flame King Cthugha' reacted. It was far more powerful than the 'Charity King Raguel'.

And above all, as if linked to Rudra's heartbeat, the fragments she had taken in were reacting.

*Heh, it doesn't matter who that slime is. He is Rimuru, a friend and ally of Veldora, and my benefactor.*

That was the conclusion she came to.

Finally, Velgrynd broke out of her circling thoughts and turned her attention to reality.

.........

......

...

Traveling across the worlds, and through the ages, Velgrynd continued to collect pieces of Ruda's 'soul'.

*I love you. I love you, Rudra!!*

With the single-minded desire to see Rudra again, Velgrynd overcame countless obstacles.

And then, finally... She spotted the boy in a big city full of skyscrapers.

![full page image](image10)

Rejoice and resolve. The boy was in possession of everything that was missing. If she gave him that, adding in the rest of what Velgrynd had...

However, Velgrynd struggled with the question of whether she could do such a thing. To do so would be to dramatically change the boy's fate. Velgrynd, who had an infinite lifespan, was perfectly capable of staying here and watching over the boy until his lifespan came to an end.

*Well, there's nothing to panic about. I want to see you as soon as possible, but I mustn't be in a rush.*

Velgrynd thought as such and was about to turn her back on the boy and walk away.

But then, a shining soul fragment flew to the boy of its own accord. Unseen by anyone, the soul fragment merged with the boy as if it had been sucked in. And with that impact, the boy vanished from this world. All that remained in Velgrynd's hand was the fragment of the beginning.

"Perhaps, you too? Have you been wanting to see me?" Velgrynd asked the fragment as if speaking to it and hoped that it was so.

And then...

She activated her 'Divine Flame King Cthugha' to follow the boy's lead.
