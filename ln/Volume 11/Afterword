# Afterword

Sorry for the long wait. I will now give you volume 11.

This volume is almost entirely different from the web novel version. Spoiler alert, the character arcs later on in the story will also differ from the web novel version. That's why their character settings will be changed as well.

Yuuki's setting was changed greatly, and I also changed a lot about the settings related to the Hero. And also because of Editor I-san's reckless interjection, all the changes were settled as final.

I recall he even threw out a couple stubborn remarks like---

"Don't you think the little girl Chloe was a bit lonely?"

Something along those lines.

It was then that I began to suspect that Editor I-san is a Lo**[redacted]**con. I'm not talking about robocon^[Someone who likes robots. This is a pun since Fuse censored the second word in his last sentence, and ロ (ro) can be thought of as ロボ (robo), and not ロリ (Loli).]---*cough*, let's put that aside for now.

Chloe's plot was already a pain in the ass, and with I-san's demands, it really gave me a headache this time. Although I dare to say it ended up making the story more interesting.

So what will happen to light novel Chloe? Stay tuned for more!

The Western Nations arc concludes in this volume. From the next volume onward, it's finally time for the Eastern Empire to strike.

There will be new characters coming as well. I hope to make the world of "Tensura" even vaster.

I'll be in everyone's care in the future as well!
