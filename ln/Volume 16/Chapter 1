# Chapter 1: The Betrayal

Emperor Rudra was replaced by Michael, and Phantom King Feldway had left.

It wasn't settled, but the feeling took its toll on everyone. There were still some uncertainties, but for now I wanted to celebrate everyone's safety. We would deal with the cleanup and future plans later. That said, Karion, Frey, and the rest of the group had gone into an evolutionary sleep, so I arranged for Testarossa to send them off discreetly.

"I'm sorry to bother you when you're tired too---"

"Please do not worry about me. I hope you take your time to relax and regain your strength."

Although it was a bit embarrassing, I'd accept the kindness for now. There were other things to think about once everything was settled down, but for now, we'd have a party to lift our spirits. I wanted to invite Laplace, but he was already gone when I sent Diablo to pick him up. In his own way, he was worried about his friends. In that light, there was no need to find and invite him. Since our agreement to fight together was still in effect, I would help him if he needed it, but for now, I decided to leave him alone. With that, I returned to the capital city of Rimuru, where I heard an unexpected report.

![break]

A corner of the outskirts of the city had been burned down. Geld and his men had protected it, so the damage was not as bad as it looked. The fire was prevented from spreading by destroying the surrounding buildings, so the human casualties were minor. The fact that there were no fatalities was good news. However, there was also bad news.

Nevertheless, everything that happened was after the fact. There was no point in panicking now, so I decided to hide my impatience and listen to the report from Geld. But Geld was not the only one lined up for the report. The current location was the banquet hall. The executives who had played such an active role this time were seated, and Shuna, Haruna-san, and Gobichi's subordinates were busy preparing meals for everyone. I wondered if it would be a good idea to conduct the interview in such a situation, but it had to be done because of the urgency.

The seat to my right was occupied by Veldora, who still stubbornly refused to leave it, even knowing that he had no intention of listening. Veldora's selfishness was nothing new to me, so I was used to dealing with him. It was easier to leave him alone rather than to persuade him, so it was best just not to bother. So, with Veldora is on my right, Benimaru was sitting on my left. Behind me, Shion and Diablo were standing by, ready to listen to what I had to say. Aside from Diablo, Shion should have been eating with me, but she insisted that it could wait. It seemed to violate her self-imposed rule, so I let her do as she liked. So with that, the important thing was those who were here to report.

Geld was sitting in front of me. And Adalmann sat facing Benimaru, looking uncomfortable. It seemed that his evolution has succeeded, and the atmosphere around him had changed a little. I would ask him to report about it later. In front of Veldora was Ramiris's seat, and Treyni-san and Beretta were standing behind, looking after her. Incidentally, it was Charys who was pouring Veldora a drink. Ramiris herself was engrossed in her meal, disregarding the report.

"Well, I had faith that Master would be fine! When the upper levels of the labyrinth were blown off by Master's reckless sister, I thought it might be dangerous, but I had faith that Master would be fine. That's why I wasn't worried about anything from the beginning!"

Ramiris proudly said this and happily drank the juice. Her words are a mixture of lies and truth, but no one pointed it out.

"Kwaaah-hahaha! Of course. Even if the opponent was my sister, I didn't have an ounce of trepidation. Still, although just a tiny bit careless, it's all the fault of those cowardly interlopers who targeted me and ruined my victory."

This guy is just talking nonsense. Even I had been feeling scared, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Frankly, an evolved Velgrynd was pretty dangerous. Even if Veldora wanted to beat her, he only had a 50 percent chance, so he should refrain from making big statements. That's what I thought, but those who were listening were all cheering.

"As expected of Veldora-sama. I have much to learn from you..."

Charys nodded gravely.

"It was a hell of a fight. I thought I had evolved and gotten stronger, but I realized that I am not quite there yet."

Benimaru followed suit and said those words from his heart. Veldora seemed to listen with a satisfied look of triumph. However, Ramiris' comment stopped Veldora's laughter.

"You're always so careless, Master. But then again, but there's probably nothing to worry about now!"

"Probably? What are you talking about, Ramiris?"

See? I knew his words couldn't be true. Talking too much can sometimes drive you to extremes.

"Because right now, that man---Ah! I'm just relieved that I have my master!"

That man? Ramiris' words were very disturbing.

"What? N-No, uh?! I'm invincible, but there may be times when I'm not feeling as well..."

Veldora, realizing what he had done and that he had dug a hole, suddenly began making excuses too. But I think it's too late now, so I would just forget about it. This was a common occurrence anyway, so I just wouldn't worry about it.

I was more concerned about Vesta-san who was sitting at the edge of the room. I decided to leave Veldora and the others alone and ask what happened to the rest of the group.

![hard scene break]

Immediately after Rimuru left for the Empire, those who were left behind immediately went into crisis mode. The euphoric atmosphere after the celebration, which had remained until a moment ago, disappeared in an instant. The same was true for Ramiris and the others who had returned to the innermost part of the labyrinth. The evolution of the dragon lords under her command had been successfully completed, and Ramiris was in a good mood. However, when Rimuru and the others were dispatched on an emergency mission, she felt uneasy.

Ramiris wanted to spend every day happily and felt that the Jura Tempest Federation was a wonderful utopia that could fulfill her wish. For Ramiris, who had spent so much time in solitude, and whose loneliness had only been dulled by the presence of spirits, this place had become an important thing that she never wanted to lose again. That is why she was afraid of losing it.

As always, Ramiris felt that Rimuru would be fine, but for some reason, she could not shake off the bad feeling. That premonition would come true. Velgrynd, Veldora's sister, had attacked and destroyed the labyrinth Ramiris was so proud of. The labyrinth was physically indestructible, but it was the power of the True Dragons who could make this possible.

When Ramiris saw Velgrynd, she was reminded of ancient memories that she had forgotten. A long time ago, not long after Ramiris was born, she remembered seeing a rampaging Veldora, much like the great Veldanava. As the name 'Storm Dragon' implied, Veldora's main attribute was wind, but it also controlled 'space' and 'water.' Combined with a tremendous amount of magicules second only to Veldanava, Veldora was a raging storm itself. It was no exaggeration to say that Veldora, the very incarnate of a natural disaster, was the strongest on earth. However, his two sisters possessed a power even more transcendent, reaching another level. Velgrynd, who had control over heat, was of the 'Flame' attribute, which was the worst match-up with Veldora's 'Wind' attribute. She could make the difference in the amount of mana worthless, standing above Veldora with her overwhelming presence.

However, that alone was not bad. The real threat was Velzard, the eldest sister. Velzard's attribute was ice. But its essence was not water, but something else. Velzard used her powers to hide her attributes so that no one would know. Ramiris had been told by Veldanava and knew the truth about Velzard.

...No, she once knew. Unfortunately, she had forgotten it in the course of her many incarnations. No. It's not that she had forgotten completely, but it took Ramiris a long time to dig up old memories. That's why Ramiris was glad that Velgrynd was the opponent this time. If Velzard had been his enemy, then Veldora would not have stood a chance. What Ramiris remembered was the raging Veldora being obliterated by Velzard with a single blow, and Velzard's 'icy cold eyes' that took it all for granted.

That is why it was Ramiris who was most worried about Veldora at that time. Ramiris jumped around the room in circles, seemingly unable to calm down.

"Are you all right, Master?"

Such a question was the sign of Ramiris' anxiety. But at the same time, it was also an expression of care for Veldora, with the intention of saying that it was okay to run away. And yet, Veldora responded.

"Don't worry. You guys just sit there and give witness to my bravery!"

For some reason, revealed a look of seeming relief, as if there was not a hint of unease in his heart. He left the labyrinth alone, full of confidence. At this point, Veldora looked very dazzling to Ramiris. She remembered the way he used to be, and his growth until now struck a chord with her.

![break]

After Veldora's sortie against Velgrynd, Ramiris looked around at the faces of those remaining in the 'Control Room.' Charys was left here after being told by Veldora that he was unable to help. But that was just the way it was. Charys would be useless against Velgrynd, who had control over heat. As always, Beretta was the one who remained calm and collected. His usual demeanor calmed Ramiris down.

Those who had been transformed into dryas doll dryads by Rimuru's hands were also under Beretta's command as operators. There were now twenty-four of them. Since Rimuru had evolved them in his spare time, they had all become excellent labyrinth keepers. Treyni and her sisters Trya and Triss were also there. They were watching over Ramiris with their usual calm expressions.

The rest of the group, in addition to Vesta and Dino, were recent additions to the research staff. They were Shinji Tanimura, Mark Lauren, and Xin Liuxing, along with their two apprentice assistants, Lucius, and Raymond. These five were treated as Gadra's subordinates when the labyrinth entered the war. However, now that Gadra was away, they were helping Ramiris as her assistants in the 'Control Room'.

Everyone was looking back at Ramiris with concern. So Ramiris shouted out cheerfully.

"Really! I'm not worried at all. Master is definitely going to win. If he loses, Rimuru will take care of everything, I'm sure of it. Besides, Master is invincible as long as you don't overlook him!"

With those words, Ramiris calmed herself down. Veldora and Rimuru would surely bring back their peaceful life, she thought. The anxiety was lifted from the scene, but the incident occurred shortly thereafter.

![soft scene break]

"Warning! There's an intruder!"

Alpha, the chief operator, shouted loudly. Hearing this, everyone switched their minds and went into their battle stances.

"Display it on the monitor!"

As soon as Beretta's order was given, the screen split to show the scene of the invasion. Seeing a figure standing there, Ramiris couldn't help but yelp.

"Wait, isn't that an angel?! It's incarnated and transformed, but it's also giving off a foreign dangerous feeling!"

In fact, the intruders were very foreign indeed. The pure white clothes were covered with mythical equipment that emitted a black and gold glow, and the long black hair also carried a glow like fragmented starlight, which further highlighted the beauty of this person. On her back, three pairs of six pure white wings fluttered, drawing attention to her even more.

"Estimated amount of energy, here it comes! This...This is..."

Alpha was stammering.

"What's wrong? Report quickly."

Alpha regained his composure when Treyni rushed him.

"The first one has an existence value of over three million. The next five have been measured at between 400,000 and 700,000 each."

Alpha's statement succeeded in freezing the Control Room. It was the hidden purpose of the labyrinth to quantify the 'level' of lifeforms and construct relevant databases. The main idea was to help with crisis management by accumulating the necessary information about the battles within the maze as they were displayed on the screen. The numerical representation that was common to the entire process was called the 'existence value'.

It was a numerical value of magicule quantity and physical ability, plus the energy content contained in the equipped armor, however, it was different from actual combat ability. Since it is impossible to completely measure a person's ability or level of skill, it should be considered only as a reference, but it was still useful. If used properly, the operation was expected to strengthen the defense of the labyrinth. For example, dispatching people of similar level to deal with an enemy based on their existence value, or roughly guessing what level of combat skill the enemy was based on their existence value. However, this system was still in the trial stage, and it was difficult to say that we had accumulated enough data.

In this world, there were fierce players such as Hakurou, whose existence value was only about 60,000, but could overwhelm strong enemies with existence values several times higher than his own. Gobta was a particular anomaly, who had an existence value of less than 20,000, the weakest class in the A rank, yet was still stronger than Gozer and Mezer with existence values around 130,000. Since there were many such cases, it had become common sense that an existence value was only a general reference.

.........

......

...

By the way, in Tempest, existence values are also associated with the Freedom Association hierarchy.

Less than 1,000 is E Class.

D Class is from 1,000 to less than 3,000.

C Class is from 3,000 to less than 6,000.

B Class is from 6,000 to less than 8,000.

B-plus Class is from 8,000 to less than 9,000.

A-minus Class is from 9,000 to less than 10,000.

From here, there is a huge high wall, and if one can surpass it, they would join the first-class ranks (Over A rank).

An existence value of over 10,000 is A Class, which is considered Hazard-class.

More than 100,000 is judged to be Special A Class, which is considered Calamity-class.

For those who have obtained the Demon Lord Seed, the minimum value is 200,000. Rimuru's feeling is that Clayman and Frey, before their pseudo-awakening, would have had an existence value of around 400,000.

Judging from that, the Disaster-class, which is equivalent to S Class, was defined as having an existence value greater than 400,000. The S Class in Tempest does not refer to demon lords. After all, there is a large number of executives with strength equivalent to the old demon lords, so for the sake of convenience and understanding, all of the people at this level were defined as S Class.

From here on out, the standards are only used in the Jura Tempest Federation. The Catastrophe class is a designation limited to 'true dragon species' and Guy, so the Jura Tempest Federation uses the Special S Class to define the other awakened transcendents.

The pseudo-awakened Clayman was said to have had an unstable amount of magicules, but since Rimuru had once remarked that 'he was about 700,000 to 800,000, right?'. Having an existence value of 800,000 or more was defined as Special S Class, according to Rimuru's statement. Furthermore, because some of them had existence values exceeding one million, it was decided that they would be called the 'Million-class' for ease of understanding.

As a special mention for reference, the existence value of an archdemon is only 140,000 no matter who summons it. It is a uniform number, as if there is a fixed upper limit. Even Testarossa and the others were recorded to have had an initial existence value of 140,000. There was no way to confirm whether this was true or not, but Ramiris and the others had no doubt.

.........

......

...

"No way, I didn't expect it to be a Super Awakened (million-class)--- it's a seraph anyway..."

Ramiris was in a state of shock and had involuntarily stopped halfway through her sentence. Beretta nodded in return, and then went on to explain.

"The highest angel is trouble, huh? That's nasty. And even the followers are S-class. With the Floor Guardians still asleep, it may be a bit difficult to intercept them."

"B-But, we have to do something."

Ramiris replied hurriedly. As if to calm her down, Treyni softly smiled and responded.

"That is true, Ramiris-sama. So that is why, allow me to go out and meet the enemy."

Trya and Triss stood up to follow her.

"Of course, I will go with you."

"Sister, I'm coming with you too!"

Ramiris heard this, but instead of calming down, she started to panic even more.

"Hey, wait a minute! You've gotten stronger, but you still lose to them numerically!"

"Ufufu, no problem. Existence values are just a rough estimate, so let's take this opportunity to prove the strength of Ramiris-sama's followers to everyone."

Trya and Triss nodded vigorously in agreement. Ramiris wanted to stop her, but she had no other choice. However, she felt that the idea of putting only her beloved Treyni sisters in danger was unacceptable.

"It's still wrong! Rimuru and Master said that we should only fight battles we can win."

She could manipulate the labyrinth to buy more time. Hopefully, things would get better somehow... Ramiris was on the verge of escaping reality. Charys admonished her in a dissuading manner.

"Ramiris-sama, I'm afraid you'll have much difficulty stalling for time. We cannot let them get close to the level where the Guardians are sleeping, and if we leave them there, they might destroy the important facilities. Therefore, I think we should intercept them. I will also go out myself, and I'd like your permission to do so."

Now that Veldora was gone, Charys was the strongest person in this place. That is why he decided that he must do something about it.

"Beretta-dono, I will leave you in charge of protecting Ramiris-sama."

"Understood. Leave Ramiris-sama to me."

Beretta did not need to be told that. If the Treyni sisters were to go out, he believed that he was the only one who could protect Ramiris. Alpha and the others did the same. Everyone in the room stood up at once and swore to protect Ramiris. Not to be outdone, Shinji and the others also shouted.

"We'll do our best, too!"

"Oh, yes. Since we've been taken care of here, we need to return the favor."

"Agreed. We even have the Resurrection Bracelet, so we'll do our best even if we die."

"That's right. We Imperial soldiers should have been killed a long time ago, and now we have the chance to prove ourselves."

"Indeed. Otherwise, Master Gadra will be angry with me."

The air in the Control Room relaxed as the five men began chatting lightly in the face of such a formidable opponent. Ramiris also took a deep breath and showed a big smile.

"If that's the case, then do it with all your might! Even if you die, you can come back to life with me, so there's no need to spare anything! I'll send dragon lord-chan and the others to you, so make sure you win!"

Everyone nodded their heads in agreement. Then, they quickly moved into action, following their assigned roles.

![soft scene break]

The intruder Ramiris and the others had sensed was Zalario, the chief subordinate of Phantom King Feldway's men.

Zalario was a former seraph, but like the other two, he reigned over the phantoms as one of the "Three Phantom Commanders." Each of them was a Marshal who led a powerful army, and would not normally be in a position to stand on the front lines. This time, however, Feldway had given him an absolute order. Take advantage of the good opportunity of the labyrinth's destruction by Velgrynd, and make sure to wipe out the target. Feldway had told him what would happen to the Imperial troops who attacked the labyrinth. Zalario had decided that weak soldiers would only be a hindrance, and had come himself.

Accompanying him were five generals. Because they were originally high-ranking angels, such as cherubs and thrones, they had acquired a magicule amount comparable to that of demon lords by becoming phantoms. In comparison, their bodies were more vulnerable, but this was not a problem in the labyrinth environment. Because the diffusion of mana was suppressed, they would be able to show their full potential.

So now, Zalario was walking in the labyrinth, but of course, he was interrupted. As soon as he found the stairs and walked down to the basement, he could feel the space shifting. Zalario and his group looked at the situation without panicking. What appeared in front of their eyes was an empty, limited space. In the center of the space, they saw eight figures.

"Fufufu, it seems that some have come to welcome us. We mustn't lose our manners. Give your greetings."

Zalario's words were met with silent nods from the generals under his command. The two groups gradually drew closer, eventually stopping short of a face-to-face confrontation.

![break]

Treyni was the first to step forward.

"Greetings, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of Ramiris-sama, the master of this labyrinth, I, Treyni, and Charys here, would like to welcome you. I know we did not invite you here, so may I ask who you are and what your purpose is?"

Treyni spoke with a smile, but her eyes were not smiling at all. She was on the alert, ready to respond to anything that might happen. Treyni had already been strengthened to the utmost before coming here. She had the current summoning power of the Spirit King of the Wind within her, and had made it her own. Even when she fought Laplace in a long battle, she had only possessed a higher spirit, Sylphid, at the time. Considering that, Treyni had been showing her depth from the very beginning. The amount of magicules in the Spirit King is about one million in terms of existence value. Boarding such a huge amount of power in her body would impose a huge burden on Treyni, whose existence value was only 600,000. However, this was the labyrinth, and even if you died, you could be resurrected. She could challenge her opponent with all her might without worrying about the burden on her body.

Charys, who was standing one step behind Treyni, had no qualms about this. Even if his opponent had more than twice the amount of magicules than he did, he would not be intimidated by it. This was because Charys had always trained for battle against the overwhelming presence of Veldora. There were some instances in this world where people like Gobta could defeat opponents who had several times their own power. Not to mention the fact that he now had reliable company, so Charys had no doubts of his victory.

The dragon lords were the same. Rimuru had given them names as a reward, and they had evolved into Ramiris' loyal servants. Their power was equivalent to 700,000 in existence value. With further experience, they would undoubtedly be able to reach the Special S class, and in fact, rather than fear, they were itching to test their strength.

Trya and Triss had also completed the 'identification' with Sylphid, the Maiden of the Wind. Trya was to work with the dragon lords against the enemy behind Zalario, while Triss was to cover Treyni and Charys.

Although Beretta had an existence value of about 400,000, his combat skills were outstanding. He was a perfect fighting force, however, he had to stay as Ramiris' guard. Therefore, this was the strongest lineup that the labyrinth could send out at the moment.

If this group was defeated... At that time, Rigurd, Gobta, and the rest of the residual groups would have to fight an all-out battle. They were still gathering forces for the next level, so someone needed to buy some time for that alone. Of course, none of them had any intention of losing.

"This is a surprise. From what I've heard, there is not much battle power left in the labyrinth. I never thought that I'd see such a powerful people. Interesting. Very amusing---Oops, I didn't introduce myself. My name is Zalario. I am one of the Three Phantom Commanders of Phantom King Feldway-sama. Pleased to make your acquaintance."

Zalario folded gracefully at the waist and bowed. His movements were refined and sophisticated, as if he were a famous actor on stage. However, the words that came out of his mouth were not heartfelt. His attitude was one of condescension and disregard for Treyni and the others. He was using such an attitude to look down on them, not taking the Maze members into consideration at all. His true thoughts were simply too obvious. Treyni was annoyed by this, but she was not foolish enough to get upset here. Having made a mistake against Laplace, she tried to keep her cool and continue the conversation.

"I see, so you are Zalario-sama of the Three Phantom Commanders. With all due respect, I have never heard of you."

Treyni spoke with a bit of provocation, and Zalario gave her a generous smile.

"That's right. Although we are well known in other worlds, we have long since left this one. I suppose we are now foreigners to this world."

"Foreigners, you say?"

"Yes. So we are not going to seek any satisfaction in that regard."

"..."

"By the way, you asked us why we were here, correct? Of course, I'll tell you as it would save us a lot of work if we could get your help."

"That depends on the content."

"All right. Our goal is to eliminate the boy, Masayuki Honjou. If you give him to me without hiding him, I will withdraw."

Zalario's gentle good looks gave way to a soft, feminine voice as he announced his intention to kill Masayuki. There was no one who would nod their heads in agreement. Because Masayuki was Rimuru's friend and an irreplaceable companion of Treyni and the others.

"How funny. I am sorry to say that negotiations are over."

"I see. I am very sorry to hear that."

Zalario laughed, making no effort to hide the fact that he was not at all disappointed. And in the next moment, the battle suddenly began.

![soft scene break]

Treyni kicked off the ground and flew through the air, and from the sky, countless invisible blades flew at Zalario. This was Treyni's unavoidable special move, the Invisible Blade. This Invisible Blade was not just a rupture due to air compression. It was a spatial attribute and had the power to cut off even dimensions. Since it could be performed invisibly and without any preliminary movements, one could understand how dangerous Treyni had become. However, this time, the opponent was very strong.

No---he was overpowering.

Zalario didn't move an inch from his spot. It wasn't that he was unaware of the blade and couldn't react, it was that he simply did not need to evade. The moment the invisible blade seemed to cut Zalario, the blade disappeared. There was a distortion in space that covered the surface of Zalario's body. A technique that was very similar to this phenomenon was registered in the Maze's database. It was the Distortion Field, that Zegion specialized in. It was a technique of absolute defense that nullified all kinds of attribute attacks and even spatial disruptions.

"What?!"

"The same technique as Zegion-dono. That's really troublesome."

"Oh? Then you're saying that there is someone here who can use space distortion defense (Distortion Field). Zegion, was it? Well then, I had heard that all the top brass in this country had been shut down, but I guess that was a terrible misinformation..."

Despite his tone, Zalario's expression was unperturbed. It couldn't have been clearer that he hadn't shown any of his true ability, and he seemed to be enjoying himself. Treyni's expression was also stern because of this. Immediately, she exchanged glances with Charys and changed her plan. Instead of forcing Zalario to defeat, she decided to focus on buying time. In fact, the five generals that Zalario had brought with him were having a difficult time in the face of the labyrinthine forces. This was the result of the dragon lords, who had been constantly training for battle, demonstrating their abilities to the fullest. In addition, since their home ground in the labyrinth was the battlefield, the labyrinthine forces were as good as immortal. Because of this, they were able to fight beyond their limits, and play a one-sided game against those of equal ability.

*We can win at this rate*, Treyni thought.

Zalario was a threat, but the others would soon be eliminated. If they all kept up this momentum, they would be able to defeat the Distortion Field defense if everyone joined forces. Worst case scenario, they could wait for Zalario to wear out.

*That's right. As long as we can drive him back, we will have achieved our victory condition. There is no need to push things. And yet...why is he still acting so calm...?*

Even though their side should definitely have the advantage, Treyni could not shake her uneasiness. The reason for this was Zalario's consistent attitude of unconcern. A wise man would not misread the current war situation. Moreover, Zalario had announced himself as a general of the army. Common sense dictated that a man who could lead demon lord-level subordinates would not make such a rudimentary error in judgment.

*This man's goal is to eliminate the Hero Masayuki, right?---No way?!*

If he wanted to kill Masayuki alone, it would be easier to assassinate him. The existence value of Zalario's presence was so high that the possibility had been overlooked.

<Ramiris-sama! Are you aware of Masayuki-dono's location?>

<What, out of the blue? Of course I'm aware of it.>

Treyni inquired to Ramiris on the 'Telepathy Net.' Ramiris, on the other hand, was not sitting idly by watching the battle. The intruders were a big problem, but the more pressing issue was the evacuation of the city residents. Now that Veldora was on the move, the urban areas that were being forcibly isolated were not safe. If Veldora was defeated, the urban areas would automatically return to their natural state. This was unavoidable as Ramiris' power alone could not maintain the current status. That was why it was necessary to evacuate the inhabitants before that could happen. Fortunately, the 95th floor, which was now the 100th floor, had enough open space to deploy an army. It was not possible to admit civilians into the research facility, but it was possible to accept all of the residents of the town. When Beretta pointed this out, Ramiris was in a panic to take action.

<Please check on his safety immediately!>

<They are the only intruders, so I think you're worrying too much...>

Despite the fact that she was busy too, Ramiris complied with Treyni's request. As a result, Masayuki was safe, just as Ramiris had expected.

<Well, he's fine after all. He's in the city now, helping to evacuate the people in the city.>

As Ramiris said, Masayuki was helping to calm down the people in the city. If Masayuki hadn't been there, there would have been a panic that could have delayed the evacuation. It was at times like this that Masayuki's skill really came into its own. There was no sign of fighting, and the situation was peaceful. In the first place, the labyrinth was under Ramiris' control, so anything that happened was immediately made obvious. When she told her that, Treyni finally showed a sign of relief.

<I see, then I can rest assured...>

But even so, she still felt unconvinced.

<Does it bother you?>

<Yes, if the enemy is trying to assassinate Masayuki-dono, there is a chance that the evacuees could get caught up in it.>

Treyni thought to herself that perhaps she was overthinking things. But even so, an alarm was going off somewhere in her mind saying that she should be careful.

<I understand! If Treyni-chan is so insistent, then Masayuki and the others will go to the 70th floor!>

Upon hearing this, Treyni was satisfied. As of now, there were remnants of the Imperial Army in the 70th levels. Even if the assassins showed up, they would buy them some time.

<You can rest easy then, right?>

<That's right!>

Thus, Masayuki went to the 70th floor.

![hard scene break]

*The people here are too good at ordering others around...*

Masayuki let out a deep sigh. Everyone in this country, including Rimuru, had the tendency to act on the spur of the moment to their own initiative. Leaving it at that, Masayuki really wished that the guys in the upper echelons would think more about others' positions, and act more cautiously. Of course, not all of them were like that.

"Why can't you be more concerned about me like Shuna-san?"

What unintentionally leaked out of his mouth were his true feelings. If a beautiful and innocent girl like Shuna had asked him to do so, Masayuki would have had no complaints. That was why he was willing to help with the evacuation... But Ramiris interrupted him.

"I want you to head for the 70th floor immediately!"

Ramiris ordered him to do so with indefensible momentum. Masayuki was not pleased. But then again, Ramiris was a powerful being. Not only did she have Veldora's backing, but she was one of the people who knew Masayuki's secret. No matter what he said, there was no way he could defy her.

"Give it up. I don't think Ramiris-sama has any bad intentions; she just can't afford it. It's clearly an emergency situation, after all. They've even sent out Veldora-sama."

A young man walking next to Masayuki responded. He had snake-shaped earrings on his ears. A rugged wristwatch and a ring of skulls on his finger were worn. He wore a leather jacket with thorns over a poisonous purple shirt, adorned with jangly accessories such as a spiked collar around his neck. His long pants with a flap skirt were made of shiny black leather along with his boots with black soles. In simpler terms, this was what one called punk fashion. It was the kind of thing Masayuki was not fond of.

Yet, strangely enough, Masayuki and he had hit it off surprisingly well. Perhaps the reason for this was that the young man was also a struggling laborer. The young man's name was Venom, and he always seemed to be bossed around by his superior into all sorts of unreasonable situations. The fact that Venom's behavior was similar to his own made Masayuki feel closer to him. According to Venom, 'I have no human rights.' Venom's boss had ordered him to protect Masayuki, and now they were working together. It felt too awkward to meet Jiwu and Bernie, and he had also broken up with Jinrai. As a mere imposter, he could not protect Jinrai with his bluffs, so Masayuki had said goodbye to him himself.

*"If you need me, you can always call on me! In the meantime, I'll be working at the guild in this country to keep my skills sharp."*

After saying that, Jinrai accepted Masayuki's proposal, and became a guild employee of Tempest, helping Masayuki behind the scenes. It was sad to see him go, but he was also relieved. Now he didn't have to lie to his friends, and his guilt was gone. Then, Venom appeared in front of Masayuki, who was now alone. Venom knew that Masayuki was weak. That's why he was there to protect him, and despite his appearance, he was willing to listen to what Masayuki had to say. He also offered to help Masayuki so that his reputation would not be damaged. This was also in line with Rimuru's intentions, so Masayuki did not hesitate to take advantage of it. The two of them had now become good friends.

"Look, I know it's an emergency. If that's the case, then why do they want to separate me, the Hero, from the rest of the town?"

"No, you're weak. If the enemy really attacked, you wouldn't be able to do anything, right?"

"I know, I know, but... But it's not right! The anxious look in everyone's eyes is cutting into my heart..."

'Please don't go'---even if they didn't say it directly, Masayuki could understand what the residents wanted. That was why Masayuki was getting frustrated with Ramiris' order. But from Venom's point of view, it was a different story. When asking which side was safer, the 70th floor was definitely better than the 100th. Not only were there a significant number of Imperial Army members there, but there were also the Surmounters on the 70th floor research facility. Although the Surmounters were mainly in charge of protecting the children, he thought that they would be able to protect Masayuki as well once he got there. What mattered most to Venom was the mission that Diablo had given him. He had to protect Masayuki with his life.

"Well, it is reassuring to have you around, but well, the evacuation has already been completed to some extent, and the defense of the 100th floor is perfect."

In fact, against an enemy that could penetrate this far, one would need to be a Floor Guardian class. The 60th floor was currently unprotected due to the absence of Gadra and Shinji's retreat, so the 70th floor was now the first line of defense.

"That means I'm in danger, right?!"

That's how it seemed, Venom nodded.

"That's right, but don't worry. I'm here. I'll take full responsibility for protecting you."

"Well then, I'm counting on you."

Masayuki was actually slightly aware of his current situation. The fact that he had been moved to the front line in this situation suggested that there were enemies who were targeting him. If it wasn't for that, Ramiris would not have risked exposing Masayuki, who was completely devoid of any combat ability, to danger. Masayuki also possessed the Resurrection Bracelet, which allowed him to revive even if he died inside the labyrinth. Therefore, Ramiris could have no hesitation in using Masayuki as a decoy.

"I guess that's it. Besides, this was probably because she didn't want to involve the other residents. She also doesn't want to risk them finding out you're weak, so it's better to just go along with it."

"That's right. I understand that, but I have my own problems as well..."

On the 70th floor, there was Jiwu and Bernie. For Masayuki, the awkwardness of the possibility of meeting them was more of a problem.

"I don't know much about those two, but if they were on a mission, don't blame them too much. I'm sure they didn't mean everything they said when they tried to kill you. Unlike monsters, humans are complicated. That's why humans are good toys for demons."

As he stared at Venom, who was smiling at him, Masayuki thought, 'It's not that simple.' However, as Venom said, it was difficult to know the true feelings of people, and it was true that he could not hold a grudge against Jiwu or Bernie. If that was the case, it wasn't worth worrying about.

![break]

Upon arriving at the 70th floor and seeing the construction site where the Imperial Army was stationed, Masayuki had finally made up his mind.

"Please don't ever use me as a toy."

Shaking his head in disbelief, Masayuki switched his mood and spoke casually to his friend, Venom. Sensing the change in mood, Venom smirked at him. It was his mission to protect Masayuki, but Venom himself was also fond of Masayuki.

![full page image](image1)

Deep down, Venom respected Masayuki because they were both overworked people and because he possessed a strong will that endured despite his weaknesses, and even when he was driven by unchangeable circumstances. Venom was also proud of his rebellious spirit, but for some reason, he felt that he was not as good as Masayuki. That's why Venom tried to reply with good intentions...

"Hahaha! That depends on how you do---huh?!"

Facing the sudden presence, Venom stood in front of Masayuki to protect him.

"Who are you, bastard?"

"Damn, you got in my way. I clearly had perfect timing, but my unaccustomed body was slow to react."

The man ignored Venom and glared at Masayuki with a look of annoyance. In the face of this clearly foreign presence, Masayuki could not hide his agitation. Masayuki, who had been completely unaware of the presence before, now felt overwhelmed by his aura. On his back, three pairs into six pure white wings were fluttering, emphasizing his fearless physical. His well-developed muscles peeked out from his wide, pure white garments. What was most striking of all were his eyes which were like those of fierce predator, fierce and unapproachable, with a terrible, ghastly light in its eyes.

"Don't ignore me!"

While shouting this, Venom unleashed an upper roundhouse kick. It was a clean, conventional kick that struck the enemy in the side of the head as if it had been drawn in, and yet...

Masayuki was stunned. To his surprise, the man took Venom's kick completely unprotected. It wasn't that he couldn't react, it was just that he found it unnecessary.

"Hmph, just a worm that doesn't even have any survival value. You're a part of those evil demons that have been standing in our way since ancient times. You have been very disrespectful to me, Cornu-sama, one of the Three Phantom Commanders! Know your place, and die!!"

The one who called himself Cornu held out his hand casually towards Venom. In the next instant, a compressed mana bullet was unleashed, piercing Venom with an unavoidable speed. Masayuki was distracted by strange things, such as the fact that this person referred to himself with 'Sama,' but he rushed over to Venom to take care of him.

"Hey! Are you okay?"

Venom was still alive. He had reacted just in time and managed to deflect the mana bullet with his left arm. But even so, the damage was extensive. Venom's left arm was gone, and there was a huge hole in his left side.

"...How can it be okay? It's hard to believe, and I hate to admit it, but that bastard looks a hell of a lot stronger than me. But don't worry, I'll definitely protect you."

With that said, Venom stood up without a care in the world. He wasn't unharmed, but he was not out of the fight either.

"Well, that's one stubborn worm. I should be the one to kill the boy while Zalario acts as a decoy. This is why I hate fools; they resist in vain."

Seeing Cornu lamenting this, Masayuki felt like complaining to him. He had no idea why he had to be killed. Besides, he felt responsible for the damage he had caused to Venom.

"Venom..."

"I knew it. That invading bastard is after Masayuki."

"You knew all along?"

"When Ramiris-sama contacted me, I knew it was a possibility. Well, don't worry. I may not be able to beat the bastard, but I can buy you some time."

"But---"

"I guess the only reason he hasn't killed you is because of that bracelet. If he kills you here, you'll be resurrected somewhere else. He'll be wary of that, and will want to get you out of the labyrinth. That's why I don't think he's going to launch an attack that would involve you in any way!"

Venom spoke fearlessly. And his prediction was right on the money. Masayuki had set the save point for his resurrection in the Control Room. He did not want anyone to see it, but it was reassuring in this situation.

Cornu, on the other hand, was annoyed that his plan had been discovered. Cornu had his reasons for not making any more mistakes. The reason goes back several decades. In a mission to invade another world, Cornu had failed when he was one step away from success. It is unclear what had happened, but a scorching fire had consumed the army he had been leading. As a result, Cornu was left without a single subordinate despite being one of the 'Three Phantom Commanders'. Although the wounds of that time had healed, Cornu's psyche was still burdened with an unshakable sorrow. Therefore, despite his overwhelmingly superior position, Cornu had always shown an attitude of defeat. And unfortunately, his adversary was not one to let that slide.

"I'll admit it. If this were not the labyrinth of Ramiris, I would not have had to step in at all. Burying you would be no trouble at all, as you'll die anyway, but I shall give you despair first. Let me show you my true power as you depart for the afterlife!"

Cornu was not a fool who would let his guard down at this point. He saw that Venom was not a simple opponent, and decided to do everything in his power to deal with whatever might happen. Cornu was wearing a shimmering black and gold outfit, which, like Zalario's, was the highest-grade mythical garments given only to the 'Three Phantom Commanders'. Against the fully armed Cornu, there was nothing that Venom could do. All means of attack were ineffective, and he could only wait for a mocking defeat.

"Che, damn it!"

Venom frowned at the hopeless difference in battle power. It would be useless to try to escape, and if he was eliminated, Masayuki would be taken away and disposed of. Even if Venom could be resurrected again in the labyrinth, only Diablo's purge would be awaiting him if he couldn't protect Masayuki.

*I'm screwed*, Venom thought, very much wanting to cry.

There was only one move left. To kill Masayuki with his own hands and send him back to a safe place.

"There's no other way..."

The very moment Venom was about to make that decision...

"You seem to be in trouble. Can we help?"

Two men appeared to protect Masayuki.

"You are... Minits-san?! And also Calgurio-san!"

The timid Masayuki remembered the two men he had met several times. He also remembered how nervous he had been at the mere mention of these big shot imperial dignitaries, fearing that he would be rude.

"Masayuki-dono, please just call me Minits. I feel uncomfortable being addressed as '-san' by you, who has the same face as His Majesty."

"B-But..."

"Hahaha, I agree with Minits. When I'm confronted with Masayuki-dono, I get all worked up. It's as if His Majesty is looking at me, and it gives me more strength than usual!"

The dandyish Minits and the stern Calgurio, his left eye covered by an eye patch, smiled so as to reassure Masayuki.

"Venom-kun, right? Leave the support to us."

With that said, Minits turned his gaze to Cornu. Then, an invisible force field was generated, slowing Cornu's movement. It was the effect of the Unique Skill 'Oppressor' that should have been lost from Minits.

"Minits, didn't you lose your power?"

"Yes, I did. But since it was once available, it's easy to obtain it again a second time, right?"

Calgurio couldn't help but chuckle at Minits' nonchalant reply.

"I envy you. I've lost my sense of omnipotence. However, it's still pretty easy for me to store magicules in my emptied body."

As if to prove his words, Calgurio strength began to swell. He quickly surpassed his limit into a rampant state, and his mucous membranes began to bleed. If left untreated, it would be fatal, but that didn't matter in this labyrinth. He was equipped with an unlimited number of Resurrection Bracelets that he procured from somewhere, so he didn't care about the effects on his body.

"You're exaggerating too much."

"If I can't do this much, I won't be able to show my face to the dead."

Because of the two men's participation, Venom saw hope in the situation. In addition, several men came and offered to help Venom. At first glance, Venom recognized the men and accepted without hesitation.

"That would be a big help. Don't even think about how to take him down, just try holding him back!"

"Got it!"

"Things seem to be getting interesting."

"Now that "I" am here, we're safe. Just leave it all to ME!"

The three of them were Surmounters who had come out of personal curiosity.

"I'll give the orders. So let's move, people!"

For some reason, Calgurio began calling the shots, and no one objected. After receiving the help of five people, Venom, in a supported state, began an offensive against Cornu.

"You little worms! Don't get carried away!"

Cornu was furious, but he didn't lose his cool. While controlling the strength of his strikes to prevent Masayuki from escaping, he began to move in order to eliminate the enemy one by one. Surprisingly, however, the impromptu team worked well together. Taking advantage of Cornu's inability to use large-scale destructive attacks and the Surmounter's invulnerability, Calgurio devised a plan that would cause the least amount of damage. The six of them, including Venom, made up for the hopeless disparity in their abilities with tact and courage, and succeeded in buying time by following one another. Then, taking advantage of the opportunity,

"Masayuki, this way!"

"Hurry up and get out of here. As long as you get to the research facility, you can get to the other levels, right?"

It was Bernie and Jiwu who called out to Masayuki.

"Ah, y-you guys!"

"I'm sorry. I would love to apologize properly, but I guess now is not the time. In any case, you should follow me."

"Huh? W-Wait, wait. What's Jiwu going to do?"

Apparently, Bernie intended to be Masayuki's bodyguard, but Jiwu hadn't moved from her spot and was casting some kind of magic spell.

"Yeah. You don't have to worry about me. I will disguise myself and pretend to be Masayuki to confuse him."

The one who turned around was Jiwu, who had transformed and now looked exactly like Masayuki.

"Hurry up. It looks like he is refraining from attacking you, so Jiwu's plan should be able to get around him. We'll take that opportunity to escape."

Apparently, that was part of the strategy they had come up with before getting here. Those who had rushed to support Masayuki were standing around so that Cornu could not see the moment Jiwu transformed into Masayuki. Although Masayuki was hesitant, it only lasted for a moment.

"I understand. I'll only drag everyone down if I stay anyway."

He could only reluctantly agree to the plan.

![hard scene break]

The Control Room was in chaos. The enemy that had suddenly appeared was far more troublesome than they had expected.

"Hey, have you been able to measure the existence value of the guy who is aiming for Masayuki?"

"Got it! It was roughly 1.8 million---but that ballooned up to 2.8 million after being equipped with mythical grade equipment!"

"What---that's foul!"

Alpha's report made Ramiris very upset, but complaining alone would not help, so all she could do now was think desperately about countermeasures.

"It is said that mythical-grade equipment lends its power to those it recognizes as its master. In Albert-dono's case, his existence value was more than doubled, but even with that, it seems that he still hasn't fully brought out its true potential."

Ramiris agreed with Beretta's analysis. After equipping the mythical grade equipment, Albert had become the equivalent of an incarnated spiritual lifeform, and according to the data measured at that time, his existence value had increased from 180,000 to over 400,000. This alone was already quite powerful, but it seemed that the mythical grade equipment still had a considerable amount of potential left in them. Albert had since gone into an evolutionary sleep, and there was very much to be expected for when he woke up. Once that happened, it would make one wonder just dangerous Kurobee was now that he would have grown enough to create mythical-grade equipment... But now was not the time to consider that. Mythical-grade equipment, while rare and wonderful, was only a threat in the hands of the enemy.

"What are we going to do?! Even with Treyni-chan and Charys, we're being pushed back by that Zalario guy! And besides, Venom and the others are no match for that Cornu guy..."

Ramiris' concern was understandable. Venom had evolved into a demon peer, and his existence value had risen to 400,000. However, for the others, the leader of the Surmounters was at 300,000 while the remaining two were at 200,000. As for the remnants of the Imperial Army, Minits and Calgurio had lost most of their power, and now had existence values of less than 10,000. They were not expected to be a force to be reckoned with, and one could even praise them for their willingness to participate in this battle. However, for some reason, those two were very lively.

Minits, strangely enough, was making full use of his lost Unique Skill 'Oppressor.' The fact that he was wearing a stylish suit despite being a prisoner of war was also inexplicable, giving Ramiris the illusion that he was even more capable than Venom. And Calgurio, for some reason, had been increasing his existence value since a while ago, and had now reached 400,000. Although the rate of increase had decreased, it was still rising, which was incomprehensible. It was a very interesting phenomenon. But unfortunately, now was not the time to pursue these matters. Swallowing her frustration at having so many things on her mind, Ramiris forcefully pressed back the unanalyzable displeasure and gave the orders.

"Ahhh, even if you guys die, I'll bring you back to life with my power! So feel free to use everything available. The main problem is Masayuki."

"What do you mean?"

"Even if he dies, he'll just be sent here, but if he's taken away, then that's it, right? So I think it's safer to evacuate him."

"I see."

"About that, Bernie and the others are trying to get him out."

Ramiris let out an 'ooh-oh' in exclamation. She was impressed by the fact that Bernie and the others had come to the same conclusion as herself, and that they had started to act before they had even received instructions to do so. In the first place, Masayuki was a chicken-hearted person who would never be able to commit suicide. Even in the event of an emergency, it was unlikely that he would be able to escape by killing himself. On the other hand, if Bernie was going to accompany him, she could rest assured.

"Contact Bernie! Tell him to set their escape destination to here. And, as I'm sure you're aware, if something goes wrong, just do what you must do!"

"Understood."

Following Ramiris' instructions, Alpha immediately sent out the 'Telepathy Net.' The encryption process was flawless, and the command was sent to Bernie without any time lag. After confirming that, Ramiris finally breathed a sigh of relief.

"Well, I think that's about all we can do," she said.

The large monitoring screen was divided into sections, showing the battle statuses of each location. No matter the location, their companions were struggling, and the situation was not good.

"We're really useless without Rimuru."

"The timing was terrible. If the guardians had been awake, we wouldn't have been at such a disadvantage."

"That's true, but..."

Indeed, Beretta was correct. If only they had had their usual strength, then they would not have been so far behind. But even so, Ramiris felt responsible. For Ramiris, life in the Jura Tempest Federation was irreplaceable. At that moment, Beta, who was monitoring the magicules' remaining power, shouted out in an urgent voice.

"There's an emergency!"

"What the hell is it this time?!"

"Although it was expected, the magicule supply from Veldora-sama has been cut off. At this rate, the city will be returned to the ground in less than ten minutes!"

"Eh---Wh-What the...! Does that mean that Master has been defeated?!"

That was a difficult reality for Ramiris to swallow. But with Velgrynd as his opponent, she had to admit that it was a possibility. It was the anticipation of this situation that had led to the evacuation. Ramiris decided to believe that Rimuru would find a way to take care of Veldora. Things were not going to get any better if she just stayed depressed, so she had to think positively and do whatever she could.

"So, what's the status of the evacuation?"

"No problems there. It is fortunate that Masayuki-dono succeeded in persuading those who were opposing the evacuation before he left."

No matter where, there were always those who complained too much, and the capital city Rimuru was no exception. About ten percent of the population, including those who were trying to profit from the situation and foreign merchants, had stubbornly refused to evacuate. Even those people became cooperative just by hearing Masayuki's voice. Because Masayuki-sama had said so, they became more than willing to do so. Ramiris was also surprised at what was essentially a brainwashing effect. Gamma, who had been checking the situation over there, assured that there was no one left in the city. 'No problem then,' was what Ramiris thought as she decided to separate the metropolitan area.

"The defense function cannot be activated without anyone there. It's a shame, then, that massive damage in the city will be inevitable."

"Hold on, Beretta-chan! If you say that, it's only going to shake my resolve!"

However, the situation really was unavoidable. Ramiris herself didn't have much mana left, and now that she had expanded the labyrinth to its maximum, she had no room for extra structures. That was the downside to relying on Veldora for energy, but Ramiris could not think of any other solution to this problem.

"Of course, I understand that very well. Well, I'm sure if it were Rimuru-sama, he would say that we could just rebuild everything again."

"That's right, so I guess we'll just have to be decisive and live with it..."

Gritting her teeth at her own helplessness, Ramiris continued carrying out the city evacuation. All that remained was to pray that the city would not be destroyed by stray bullets once it returned to the ground. But then...

"Emergency report!! New enemies have appeared on the surface. Two of them. We cannot measure their existence values accurately because they are outside of the labyrinth, but we estimate their numbers to be over a million at the very least!"

This time the report came from Delta, who was monitoring the surface. The size of the small monitor was switched and enlarged so that everyone could see it. What appeared on the screen were two angels---no, two fallen angels with black wings. They were a duo of a large, muscular female warrior, and a small, beautiful girl. They also had three pairs of wings.

"Are you kidding me?! They have the same number of wings, which means these guys are also seraphim..."

Panicking, Ramiris flew around, feeling completely helpless at this point. But then she remembered something, and asked Delta with a glimmer of hope.

"Delta-chan! How can you be so sure that they're the enemy? Maybe they---"

Though unlikely, the other side might actually be friendly---and to Ramiris, who had generated such naive thoughts, Delta could only tell her the cruel answer.

"It's because those two are preventing us from recovering the hole that Velgrynd-sama made. As soon as the maze is closed, our victory is confirmed...so it's unlikely."

Her answer was unquestionable and very clear.

"Oh, that's right. Thank you."

Ramiris stopped flying around and sat powerlessly on Beretta's shoulder. At this point, Ramiris felt overwhelmed with disgust by the enemy's strategy of bringing in four Million-Class enemies, to the point that she felt like cursing all night long. But just then, a reliable ally awoke.

"Leave the surface grounds to me. The city that bears the name of Rimuru-sama will not easily be destroyed."

The newly evolved Barrier Lord Geld had returned.

"Geld!!!!"

Ramiris cried with joy.

"Geld-sama's existence value is over 2.37 million! I've added up all of his equipment, and I'm sure he'll be a match for any intruder!!"

Geld's own Legendary-grade equipment had reached the Mythical-grade at the same time Geld was evolving. It was also because of Geld's surrounding youki that it had evolved so well. In fact, Rimuru never expected this either, but all those present mistakenly believed that everything was a part of Rimuru's plans.

"That's Rimuru for you. Even with my eyes, I couldn't have foreseen this kind of development."

Ramiris, whose eyes were quite piercing, said this confidently. But Beretta brushed it off as if nothing had happened.

"That's right. What a terrifying deliberate plan."

Moreover, another Awakening had been completed.

"I am here, too. The other enemy will be my prey."

It was Kumara, the "Chimera Lord."

"Kumara-sama's existence value is measured to be around 1.9 million. Without any special equipment, to have such a value, the enemy is no longer a threat!!"

At Alpha's report, the Control Room erupted in cheers. And as if to prove Alpha's words, a fierce battle began on the surface as well. What was even more surprising was that Geld's men were also scattered at various locations, setting up a powerful 'Barrier' to protect the city from the aftermath of the battle.

"Now we can win this!!"

"It looks like we're going to be okay for the time being."

Ramiris made a declaration of victory, and Beretta was relieved. However...

It was too early to relax. Phantom King Feldway's plan was not yet finished. Rather, everything up until now had merely been a diversion, and his true goal was something else entirely.

![hard scene break]

The tension that had been building in the Control Room relaxed slightly. After making a declaration of victory over Beretta's shoulder, Ramiris fell silent as if she had no strength left. But Beretta was familiar with such scenes, and from the very beginning, he had maintained a calm demeanor while continuing to take care of the restless Lord.

Shinji, who had been observing the situation from a distance, was silently taking in the current commotion as if it were someone else's problem. The battle was unfolding in a way that was beyond his understanding, to the point that he could no longer believe that it was real. That is why Shinji remained calm. He could understand why Ramiris was upset, but couldn't she have been calmer? He thought that to himself.

*If only she could learn from Beretta-san a little...*

Those were Shinji's true feeling, but he would never say it out loud. If he were to say such a thing, he would not only incur unnecessary wrath, but would also risk having his salary cut. Indeed, Ramiris's labyrinth was amazing, but Ramiris herself was weaker than Shinji. Or rather, it was a gap so large that it wasn't even necessary to compare. So no matter how much Ramiris panicked, she couldn't actually do anything about it. Besides, Shinji remembered the victory party that had been held the other day. The power of those majins was unimaginable.

And it was Demon Lord Rimuru, to whom all these powerful people swore their allegiance. Shinji was an otherworlder, and by Freedom Association standards, he was a Special A rank. He had also measured his existence value, and it was now over 120,000. On top of that, he possessed the Unique Skill 'Healer,' which had once him an ace commander in the Imperial Army. He had once conceitedly believed that his strength belonged to the upper class, yet here, he was nowhere near outstanding compared to the others.

After all, even the beautiful sisters who were working as operators here had individual existence values of over 150,000. Thus, it was quite natural for Shinji to think that there was no point in boasting or worrying about his own strength. Incidentally, Mark's existence value was 130,000, and Xin's was 120,000. They were about the same, and would not be able to do anything against the monster on the monitor. And yet, even in the current situation where all the main forces were gone, they were still able to hold a stalemate with the enemy. That alone was a great achievement, Shinji thought.

Looking back on it now, even the battle power of the Empire's prided Armored Corps was actually less than thirty percent of the total strength of Tempest. And that was only before the victory celebration. At the celebration, Demon Lord Rimuru had given the executives new powers as a reward, causing most of the higher majins to fall into an evolutionary sleep. As a result, some of them had even begun to reach the Million-class. To be honest, Shinji's understanding could not keep up with the status quo anymore. As was the case with Geld earlier, the evolution of monsters was truly inexplicable.

*I'm so glad that I defected from the Empire to Tempest!*

Shinji thanked Master Gadra from the bottom of his heart. He looked on the monitor again and saw that Minits, one of his former superiors, was struggling against Cornu, one of the 'Three Phantom Commanders'. The scene looked like something out of a movie.

*After all, what can one do against such monsters? I mean, it's hard to believe that there are even people like that in this world.*

From Shinji's point of view, Minits and Calgurio, who were willing to challenge the enemy even though they had lost their powers, were more abnormal. At the same time, seeing them regain their strength in the face of such a powerful enemy just like in a movie made him feel that the upper echelons of the empire were not so bad. In short, it was extremely unrealistic.

'Could it be that they think of themselves as the main characters?'---It even made Shinji generate such doubts.

Perhaps that was why Shinji did not feel a sense of crisis and switched his thoughts to something more interesting. To put it simply, it was an escape from reality. He was thinking about Shuna, who had just brought snacks for everyone.

*Yeah, Shuna-san is still so cute and pretty.*

It didn't matter what he thought about his employer---or rather, he didn't care. What currently occupied Shinji's mind was not the tactless fighting, but the very cute Shuna. The memory of her bowing and leaving the room was enough to make Shinji feel happy. She was dignified, and had no flaws. And although Shuna looked like a fragile and beautiful girl, it was well known that she became very scary when she was angry. Shinji was not the only one who admired Shuna. Mark, Xin, and the new apprentice assistants, Lucius, and Raymond, were also members of the 'Shuna fan club'. In comparison, his employer, Ramiris was...

He couldn't help but sigh.

"Hey, Shinji-chan. Is there something you have to say to me?"

It was only at times like these that Ramiris' instincts were keen.

"No, it's nothing."

Shinji hurriedly scrambled to deny anything. Master Gadra had also often scolded him, saying that 'If you want to be a wizard, you have to be calm and collected. You're not even close to ready yet!' After experiencing such a situation just now, he couldn't help but understand why Master had scolded him. It was true that Shinji was emotional, and he was not good at manipulating emotions, which was essential for a wizard. Xin, for example, was expressionless and unaware of his emotions, but he lacked the aptitude for magic. Gadra had always told him that it would have been better if it was the other way around. But Gadra also said that while Shinji could not appreciate the emotion of expressionlessness, he was not lacking in aptitude for magic; on the contrary, he was highly qualified. That's why Shinji had no choice but to admit that he was in the wrong.

*Well, now that I can afford to be angry, maybe I can get Ramiris-sama to forgive me.*

Shinji thought to himself. In the first place, it was a mistake to compare Shuna and Ramiris. That was like comparing an adult to a child. Or rather, there were actually more fundamental reasons for the difference. Shuna still had the air of a young girl, but her manner was that of a sophisticated adult. While Ramiris has been alive for thousands of years, but her mental age was still low, perhaps because her body was still growing. Ramiris, who was a child in both appearance and mind, could not compete with Shuna at all.

*But Ramiris always seems cute, so it's better to treat her more gently*---that's what Shinji thought.

![break]

And so, with that, Shinji's thoughts were currently focused on unnecessary things. It was because of this that he took notice. It was because of this that he realized that the man who was always so lazy had stood up at some point. And for some reason, Vesta, his always-serious boss, was lying asleep on his desk.

"Huh? Dino-san, what are you doing...?"

It was really just a coincidence that Shinji had asked that question. However, that one action was the most crucial play of the day. Shinji, who had been the least conscientious of the group, took the greatest credit for the day.

![hard scene break]

Dino stood up and tried to fulfill his assigned role. He hated working, and he was reluctant, but he could not refuse the request from someone he had known for a long time. Above all, he was driven by a compulsive notion that he had to do it. However, his actions were unexpectedly interrupted.

"Huh? Dino-san, what are you doing...?"

Dino knew that his plan had failed the moment he heard Shinji's voice. He had planned to finish everything quickly so that no one would notice, but was interrupted by the timing of divine intervention. No one should have been able to read Dino's actions, but there was a blunder. Beretta grabbed Ramiris' hand just as he reached out to grab her. It all happened instantaneously. If Shinji had not spoken, Dino would not have been noticed.

"What do you think you're doing, Dino-sama?"

"I'm honestly surprised. I didn't expect to be interrupted. Good grief, I was so wary because of your presence, and was looking for an opportunity to relax."

"..."

"Give me a break, Shinji. You've got all the makings of a big shot."

Dino complained, but he meant what he said. He knew that there were only a few people in this world who could have seen through what he was doing. Dino had been so confident, but now it was all a waste of time. Dino let out a long, depressed sigh, then gave Shinji a glare. Then, shaking his head, he turned his gaze back and looked at Beretta with narrowed eyes. Shinji and the others finally understood that the situation had become more serious than usual. But that didn't mean they could easily do anything about it. Alpha and the others moved to surround Dino while picking up Ramiris from Beretta's shoulder to protect her.

"...Eh? Eh---?!"

Ramiris, who had been unable to keep up with the sudden turn of events, seemed to be trying desperately to make sense of the situation as she looked alternately between Beretta and Dino. Shinji distanced himself from Dino to take care of Vesta. However, Shinji's companions, Mark, and the others, remained in place. They seemed to have fallen asleep in spite of the situation. It was obvious to everyone that this was abnormal.

"Hey, Dino-san! You did something, didn't you?!"

Shinji shouted, to which Dino replied lazily.

"Well, yeah. But really, if you're resisting my power, then your skills must be pretty good too. I'm impressed, Shinji."

"I'm not happy about the compliment."

Shinji replied as such, even though he was actually a bit flattered. Dino only shrugged his shoulders. He had complimented Shinji, but did not look at him as if he did not care. He only looked over Beretta's shoulder to Ramiris and spoke.

"Ramiris, I'm sorry, but can you cooperate with us? I don't want to get rough with you, and I promise to take good care of you if you cooperate. Look, we don't want to shed wasteful blood on each other, right? So, why don't you just come with me?"

Dino said this with a serious expression on his face. Needless to say, Ramiris's reaction to this was rejection.

"Huh? You're the one who's talking out of your mind. What the hell are you doing? If you keep talking like that, Rimuru will beat you to a pulp when he comes back."

Ramiris was borrowing the authority of others as always, but she was not wrong in her words. So Dino could only laugh bitterly.

"That's right. I figured you would say that. But I can't justify that as enough for now. After all, I am still the Watcher, even if I don't want to be."

"When you say "Watcher," do you mean from the Seven Primordial Angels who were of Veldanava-sama's inner circle?"

"Correct. Actually, I used to be one of the Primordial Angels. After Feldway and the others left for the other world, I was assigned to watch over the surface."

"You got to be kidding?!"

"No, this couldn't be more true."

For Ramiris, this was a shocking fact that she had only just now learned. She was always thinking that Dino was as much of a liability to the Demon Lords as herself, not realizing that he was actually an important figure. Ramiris could never have imagined that Veldanava, the creator god, had named him himself. Incidentally, Ramiris had also been named by Veldanava, but she had forgotten all about it due to being reincarnated too many times. She would remember everything once she became whole, but she did not know when that would be.

"I thought that the Originals had all left."

"No, that's not the case. When the surface world became peaceful, Veldanava-sama began to seek the stability of the otherworld. I think you know that."

"Huh? W-Well, yeah..."

Ramiris' behavior became a little strange, but Dino just let it slide. It was too much of a hassle to get into it, and he didn't want to explain it anymore. So he took it as if Ramiris was in the know and continued the conversation.

"So, Feldway and three other Originals were assigned to that mission. There were three of us left, including myself, and we worked as Veldanava-sama's hands and feet."

"Even you?"

"It's fair for you to be suspicious, but I was a serious man back then. But then a certain incident happened. That, coupled with various internal circumstances, corrupted me, and I went from a seraph to a Fallen Angel. My other colleagues are the same way, and now there's not a single decent primordial angel left."

"Wait, you left out the most important part of the story! The part that is the most important and the one that bothers me the most!"

Ramiris couldn't hold back her retort, but Dino just sighed in annoyance.

"Shut up, it's too hard to explain. It's not important to me, so I'll let your imagination fill in the blanks and we can start negotiating."

'It's just too absurd to leave something like this to the imagination'---That was the impression of everyone who was listening on the spot. However, Dino was notorious for his lack of patience, so everyone gave up, thinking that it would be useless to ask for a further explanation. As it was, they chose to focus on what Dino had to say.

"So, what do you mean by negotiating?"

Ramiris asked on behalf of the group.

"It's exactly as I said. If Ramiris is willing to cooperate, then I swear I won't touch anyone in this labyrinth. But if you refuse, then there's no other way. I'll have no choice but to kidnap you, even if it means killing everyone who gets in my way."

"There's no way I'll cooperate if you do that."

"Well, I suppose you're right, but that's not really a problem. The best outcome is to have your compliance, but even in the worst-case scenario, as long as you can seal the labyrinth, it's fine."

"This is not what you want, is it? Who is commanding you to do this?"

"Well, I don't know if I can tell you that..."

"I mean, I thought Guy was the only one who could give you orders."

"Well, I guess it's something like that...but that's not quite right either. Guy and I are on equal footing, so why should I take orders from him?"

"Whatever, that doesn't matter!"

"Uh no, it's important..."

Ignoring Dino's rant, Ramiris began to think.

"If it isn't Guy, then... That's right! It's Feldway, the leader of the First Order! He must have come back from the other world and approached you while you were wandering around. You couldn't resist him, could you?"

Detective Ramiris' version of "mystery" guesswork was truly frightening. She was always making all the wrong inferences in her reasoning, but somehow, she always ended up at the correct answer. And this time, she got it right once again.

"That's amazing, it's actually the right answer..."

The operation, which Feldway had put most of his resources into, was executed to perfection with two main objectives. One was to assassinate Masayuki. And the other was to destroy the labyrinth. Destroying the labyrinth would have been a daunting task, and there was a risk that the plan could go completely awry. Feldway believed it to be important to secure Ramiris in order to prevent that from happening. With the idea of eliminating all elements of uncertainty, Feldway formulated the battle plan, and Dino merely acted in line with that.

"Hmph...you parted ways with Feldway because you were a delinquent, right? That guy looks like a first-rate honor student, so you two don't seem to fit together."

"Hey, I'm not a delinquent! I just like being lazy a lot. Well, it is true that his orders were annoying, so I was glad that he was gone..."

Dino explained that even without any contact, their past relationship still remained.

"I see. Then that means the attackers are the Originals? That's not good!! You should just ignore Feldway's orders and come over to our side!!"

Dino smiled at Ramiris, who was saying the most outrageous things. But he still couldn't nod his head in agreement.

"It's unfortunate, but I also have my own situation."

In fact, Dino himself found it incredibly strange that he could not disobey Feldway. But even so, Dino simply rejected Ramiris' proposal.

"You...it seems that you're serious. That's quite a lot of nerve. I'll deal with you myself. I'm a pillar of the Octagram too, and I'm determined to protect this place until Rimuru returns!"

Ramiris made her determination clear.

"So it seems. Honestly, I don't really want to work. Being able to live in a world where I don't have to do anything is truly ideal, but it can't be helped. Unfortunately, I can't be merciful. Don't worry, I won't take your life, so do your best to get rid of me."

Dino returned to his usual easy-going and languid expression, and replied with a wave of his hand. In this way, the negotiations were concluded. The time for conversation was over, the battle had begun...

![soft scene break]

"Get him, Beretta-chan!"

Ramiris excitedly shouted, as if influenced by some energy. Of course, Ramiris herself never fought. That was as Dino had expected, so he decided not to make fun of it and confronted Beretta to see what he could do.

The 'Control Room' turned into a battlefield. It was a fairly large space, but there were many obstacles such as desks and chairs. It was not an environment suitable for fighting, and Ramiris wanted to relocate to a different environment. However, this was unacceptable from Dino's point of view. Because there was a high possibility that Ramiris could escape. Therefore, Alpha and the others were busy retrieving the important equipment while the two were facing each other. Without paying attention to their surroundings, Dino and Beretta began to fight.

Dino, out of nowhere, pulled out a huge sword that was as tall as he was. This great sword was called the "Kuzurekiba (Crumbling Fang)." It was a single-bladed sword with a thick body and appeared to be so powerful that the weight alone might have been enough to break an opponent.

![full page image](image2)

It was a heavy weapon that was heavily in contrast to Dino, who was dressed lightly in his normal clothes, breastplate, and robe. But even so, it looked very natural and elegant.

"What is the performance of that sword?"

"In terms of existence value... It's a million."

Alpha couldn't hide her surprise at the report.

"What the hell, a mythical-grade?! Even if it's Dino, that's a foul play!"

Ramiris shouted an unintelligible complaint, but Dino just ignored her. Dino re-positioned his Kuzurekiba above his head. Beretta, on the other hand, was bare handed. However, his body was made up of the magical steel doll that Rimuru had made. Now that it had become well acquainted with Beretta's mana, it had been transformed into a living magic steel (adamantite). Its shape was still the same as when Rimuru had made it, but its strength was incomparable. Moreover, since it was imbued with Beretta's magical aura, ordinary weapons would be useless. Beretta was a full-body weapon of legendary-grade or higher, the hardest existence in the labyrinth. Even so---

Dino casually swung down his large sword. Beretta did not hesitate to sidestep and avoid it.

Not having a weapon in hand was not a disadvantage, but this time the situation was bad. Beretta's existence value was over 400,000, which was almost equal to Dino's. However, unless Beretta was armed with mythical-grade weapons, he would not be able to compete properly. Beretta, who was empty-handed, concentrated on evading Dino's sword blows instead of taking them head-on. If Beretta was hit by the blade, he would have instantly been destroyed. And even worse...

"Dino-sama's existence value has increased from 400,000 to 2 million! The total is 3 million...how overwhelming..."

Alpha reported desperately. However, Beretta remained unfazed. Ramiris wasn't surprised either, as if taking it for granted.

"I don't know how you did it, but you fooled the existence value meter. I guess that means there's still room for improvement. Also, Alpha, don't refer to Dino so politely!"

"Hey, it's fine. I'm still a demon lord too, right?"

"Shut up! Beretta-chan, you don't have to be polite either, so hurry up and unleash your true power! Let that fool taste heaven's judgment!"

"I don't have that kind of power, but if it's an order, then I shall do my best."

Beretta was as hard-working as ever. Even though the existence value was only a rough estimate, there was still a severe difference of over seven times. Despite feeling inwardly that Ramiris could really be unreasonable, Beretta responded to his master's expectations by watching Dino closely.

"You're not easy to deal with, either."

"I don't want to hear that from my enemy, but I will not deny it."

Beretta responded while focusing on evasion, circling Dino. There was no need to be defensive as long as the attacks didn't hit. The key was to think differently. Beretta's whole body was a weapon. His bare hands were not at a disadvantage. On the contrary, they could be used as various means of attack. On the other hand, Dino was lightly armed and the only thing to watch out for was the big sword. The conditions were the same in that a hit would result in a heavy blow. Because of this, he still had a chance to win. Beretta thought as much, and had been looking for opportunities. As a 'chaos doll', Beretta was very good at changing attributes. Using his Unique Skill 'Double-Crosser,' he could constantly switch attributes one after another and search for Dino's weaknesses. He was facing Dino while calculating every move in order to make the situation work in his favor. Dino, who was on the receiving end of the attack, was not happy.

"Geez, you're a dependent of the Black line, aren't you? I've heard that your kind are one of the best when it comes to dirty fighting tactics."

"I am honored by your kind words."

"Who's complimenting you?!"

Even dialogue was used as a weapon as Beretta tried to overturn his disadvantage. There was no room for error. Thanks to the fact that Beretta was not impatient, he barely managed to maintain the status quo.

![hard scene break]

Dino, on the other hand...

After correctly recognizing the current situation, he knew that he was not in an advantageous position. The failed surprise attack was a huge mistake. It had needlessly led to more battles, and the plan was thwarted into chaos. Although the difference in ability between Beretta and Dino was enormous, there was not much of a gap between skill levels. However, it was clear that Beretta was nearing his limits. But this was Ramiris' labyrinth, and Beretta could be resurrected even if he died. He did not have to worry about depleting his remaining energy, nor would he be damaged by using excessive force. It was only because he could ignore all these restrictions that he was able to give his all to resist Dino. They were protected by environmental effects, but even that had its limits. Beretta was not strong enough to overturn the decisive power difference.

*But still, it's quite remarkable. I didn't think that a dependent of Black would be so difficult.*

Dino had raised his evaluation of Beretta. If it had been Charys or Treyni, the game would have ended more quickly. Those two were by no means weak, but angels had an overwhelming advantage over the spirits. Also, there was too much a difference in combat experience. But Beretta, as befitting a member of the Black line, had a level of skill that was comparable to that of Dino's.

He was in a situation where even a single blow would kill him instantly, yet he had the courage to calmly assess Dino's attack. Not only did he never give up on victory, but he even seemed to enjoy the situation. Even when Dino intentionally showed an opening, Beretta did not take the bait. That alone was worthy of praise, but it was surprising to Dino that he was even wounded by the occasional counterattack.

The Fallen were not good at dealing with holy attributes, but it was not a decisive weakness. Nevertheless, Beretta's attack was doing damage. It was a blow that combined both holy and demonic attributes, and even Dino's 'Defense Barrier' could not prevent it. Dino judged that it was practically impossible to defend against this attack. As with the spirit attacks, unless he could overcome it with his willpower, he would surely be damaged. To Dino, who was a former seraph and familiar with the laws of this world, it was astonishing that a mere unique level skill could damage him. Beretta's amazing combat acumen was deserving of praise.

However, Dino was also getting used to Beretta's movements. Dino knew that the more he swung his big sword, the bigger the gap would be. Beretta took advantage of his gap and attacked him, which was unexpected but within tolerance. At first glance, Beretta seemed to be suppressing Dino, since Dino's attacks didn't even graze him. However, "Kuzurekiba" could easily slice through even an adamantite body. There was no problem in Dino's opinion because it would only take one blow to reverse the situation. Beretta was also well aware of the current situation and was stalling for time. It seemed that Beretta had decided that Dino could not be defeated by accumulating attacks, so he was focusing more on defense.

*Well, that's the right answer, isn't it? For Beretta, defending Ramiris is a victory.*

Dino was not a fool either, seeing through Beretta's inner thoughts. As long as Ramiris was there, the people in the labyrinth would not die. Conversely, if Ramiris was killed, the labyrinth would end immediately. There was no guarantee that the labyrinth would be safe if she was kidnapped, so it was only natural for Beretta to prioritize buying time. At this rate, Beretta would eventually get what he wanted.

However, things would not be that easy. Unfortunately for Beretta, Dino still had a final hand. The reason Dino was stalling Beretta was because he needed to neutralize Beretta here. It was very troublesome to fight against an opponent who would resurrect even if you killed him. It would have been nice if he could just get to Ramiris before Beretta resurrected, but it was certain that the others would get in the way if that happened. If he attacked with the intent to kill, then it might end up involving Ramiris as well. Dino was sincere when he said that he had no intention to kill Ramiris, and that had become a shackle, binding him to the current situation and making things more difficult for him.

*This is honestly so troublesome. I can't believe how much work it's taking just to neutralize Beretta. It would have been easier to just defeat him, but now that I've finished my preparations, I guess it doesn't matter.*

"Beretta, you've done well. Now 'Slothful Sleep, Fallen Hypno!'"

Dino unleashed his power. It was a non-lethal, wide range attack of the Unique Skill 'Sloth.' All life forms would be lulled into a deep sleep and would not be able to wake up until the caster released them. There was no point in resisting with will power. It was one of the most powerful abilities of the deadly sin series, but it took a long time to activate, just like the name 'sloth' implied. However, only those with Ultimate Skill would be able to resist it. At the Unique Skill level, it was a fearsome attack that could be said to be the strongest.

Dino wanted to neutralize Beretta and the others in the gentlest way possible. He didn't want to hurt Shinji and Alpha and the others, who were in the Control Room trying to protect Ramiris. Vesta, who he had put to sleep first, was also a boss whom he truly respected. And Shinji and the others were his colleagues, with whom he felt a sense of camaraderie.

*In truth, I really did not want to betray them.*

However, Feldway's orders were absolute, and he could not resist them.

"Really, I'm sorry. Don't feel bad. I'll ask Feldway to see if he can leave this place alone."

Dino muttered to himself as Beretta collapsed. He glanced at the sleeping Ramiris, thinking that he'd finally done his job, and began extending his hand towards her...

"I won't let you."

A cold voice stopped him in his tracks.

"Seriously...?"

Dino turned to see a woman standing there. The slender cilia of her body were shining in gold and silver. The exoskeleton that protected the essential parts were a jet-black, glossy adamantite. Two pairs of wings, shining blue like those of a morpho butterfly, were the same color as the compound eyes on her forehead, exuding a mysterious charm. The true identity of the woman was Apito, who had awakened from her evolutionary slumber. The coloration of each part of her body had changed from before her evolution, but her shape remained almost the same as before. However, Apito's overall beauty had been enhanced. As the Insect Queen, she exuded an aura of majesty and was more queenly than ever before.

"---Apito...just in time. I want you to destroy my Holy Demon Core."

Because demons did not need sleep, Beretta was barely able to resist the Fallen Hypno. Despite being reduced to a state of low activity (sleep mode), he did everything in his power to ask Apito for help.

"Beretta-sama---"

"You can't move, but you're still conscious?!"

Dino's reaction was delayed for a moment due to his surprise. As a result, he was unable to stop Apito's action. Without asking why, Apito sent her poisonous needle to destroy Beretta's Holy Demon Core. Apito's regenerative Osiris Rapier pierced the strong adamantite with ease. She was able to create as many Osiris Rapiers as she wanted within her own body. Nevertheless, without evolution, Apito would not have been able to kill Beretta. Beretta laughed.

"Heh heh heh, well done. With this, I will die and rise again unharmed. I shall leave things to you for a while, Apito."

Beretta had retired as leader of the Dungeon's Elite Ten, but he was still Ramiris' second-in-command. He still has the authority to give orders to the Elite Ten.

"Understood. Unfortunately, I do not think I'll be able to beat him, so I look forward to your early return."

Contrary to her words, Apito's voice sounded confident of her victory. Dino seemed to sense this as well, and muttered in an annoyed tone.

"You've got to be kidding me...such an accurate judgment...so there's no way to take advantage of it."

Dino was correct in his judgment. Leaving the rest to Apito, Beretta disintegrated into a particle of light. Immediately after that, Apito soared beyond the speed of sound. The battle in the Control Room intensified even further.

![soft scene break]

*I really hate this.*

That was Dino's unvarnished opinion. Apito was not Dino's enemy, but she couldn't be killed in the labyrinth either. Even if he wanted to finish her off quickly and secure Ramiris, Apito would use her speed to get in the way. She wasn't fighting Dino head on, but was thoroughly implementing more of a hit-and-run tactic, moving in an out flexibly. The newly evolved Apito had a speed-focused fighting style. She was well aware of her own characteristics and made efficient use of them. Her existence value was around 700,000, but she was equal to Dino in terms of speed alone. Besides, even if he took some effort to kill her, Beretta would have returned by then. It shouldn't take more than a minute, but that couldn't be helped because it was teleportation. Even against Dino, who was far superior to Beretta, he wouldn't need more than ten seconds, so Apito alone was able to buy time.

In this situation, there were few moves Dino could make. The most reliable option was to put Beretta and Apito to sleep at the same time. Dino calmed himself down and tried to activate the Unique Skill 'Sloth' once again. Regardless of whether there are two opponents, it took time to activate the skill. That's why Dino decided to stop panicking and check the status of his companions with a calm mind, not unlike that of a combatant. The first thing that caught his attention was the sight of Rimuru fighting Velgrynd, who had been victorious in the Battle of the Monsters.

*How the hell did he get out of there?! I mean, he's fighting on equal terms with Velgrynd!*

To be honest, he was completely stunned. According to Feldway, Demon Lord Rimuru and his commanding officers were sealed off in Velgrynd's otherworldly realm.

Rimuru was able to figure out the coordinates of his location through the 'Soul Corridors' between him and his companions and had escaped easily, but Dino, who didn't know that, was puzzled. What was more surprising to him was Rimuru's strength.

It looked as if he was pushing against the seemingly invincible Velgrynd. Dino couldn't help but feel anxious.

*If we don't move forward with the mission quickly, we might be in trouble.*

With that in mind, Dino turned his attention to the others. The main point of Feldway's plan was to secure Ramiris. Dino had initially stayed in the labyrinth because Guy ordered him to be there, and it was nothing more than a coincidence, but it was unfortunate that it had caught Feldway's attention. Although Dino was reluctant to do so, he had to resign himself to the fact that he was the only one who could enter the Control Room, which was the most heavily guarded room. As for how Feldway and the others were going to get in, a bold strategy had been devised.

He had incited Velgrynd to destroy the labyrinth in order to call out Veldora. To Dino's surprise, the plan succeeded without difficulty. Then, with Feldway himself leading the way, the invasion was carried out. Accompanying Feldway were two of the 'Three Phantom Commanders' and five generals brought by Zalario. There were eight of them in all. Two of the top commanders had been recruited for this operation, which was a tremendous in itself. Only Obera of the Three Phantom Commanders had been left to guard the Palace of Monsters in the depths of the Otherworld. When Dino heard of this plan, he could not hide his surprise at their drastic actions.

Dino was not the only one who was approached by the remaining colleagues of the 'Originals' on the surface. The remaining two who had been living undercover in a human country were also called into the operation. They were Dino's subordinates, but Feldway had taken the liberty of using them without permission. Their role was to keep the labyrinth in its state of destruction. It was a precautionary measure in case Dino failed.

If Ramiris wanted to, her labyrinth could be turned into a prison. That would make it very difficult to escape from, so Feldway took steps to prevent that from happening in advance. Dino cared the most about his two subordinates, so he first confirmed where they were on the monitor.

*Hey hey, no way! Even with Pico and Gracia as opponents, they're able to fight on equal footing...*

Pico was the petite beautiful girl, and Gracia was the tall female warrior. After Veldora was defeated by Velgrynd, the city, which had been isolated in the labyrinth, was brought back to the surface. At this point, Geld had come forward to defend the city, but Dino had no idea that he could rival Pico and Gracia.

*Geld, the Barrier Lord, and Kumara, the Chimera Lord. By the way, Kumara had that group of beasts. Is she a cryptid? Could she be related to the World-destroying Dragon Ivarage---No, no, no. No way...*

Dino hastily quashed the unpleasant thoughts that had involuntarily flashed through his mind. Then, while thinking, 'They really are the Twelve Guardian Lords,' he shifted his gaze to the other battlefield. The one fighting there was Zalario, of the Three Phantom Commanders.

*Oh, that Zalario guy is as strong as ever. He doesn't seem to be taking it seriously at all, and he's showing a lot of confidence against Charys and Treyni.*

His old colleague was still as strong as ever. He had already felt at the time that Zalario was terrifyingly strong, and even after thousands of years he was still creepy to look at on the screen. He looked fine so Dino checked out the next monitor.

*Cornu? From what I've heard, he was defeated in a major invasion a few decades ago. Is that why he seems so impatient?*

As Dino had predicted, Cornu was in a hurry. It was no wonder. He had lost his entire army in the last defeat and had been injured so badly that it would take several decades to recover. If he failed this time, he would be purged by Feldway. Moreover, Feldway was supposed to be hiding at Cornu's side by now, so Dino thought that Cornu must be under a lot of pressure and was not able to perform as well as usual.

*Unlucky guy. But then again, Masayuki is really weak, and the people standing in his way don't seem like a big deal. I'm concerned about Venom being a dependent of Black, but he seems to be a newcomer compared to Beretta, so I guess it should be fine.*

Dino wasn't too worried about Cornu since they weren't that close to begin with. Even if Cornu failed, Feldway would take care of it. In other words, the operation seemed to be going well. Perhaps it was because of this sense of security that Dino's lazy mind got mixed up in the distractions.

*Hmm, but it's incredibly strange. Why do I have to worry about the success or failure of this mission? I don't understand.*

That was a very important point of suspicion. For some reason, Dino could not shake his feeling of discomfort about this mission. He could not figure out why, and it left him feeling uncomfortable, as if the cause was on the tip of his tongue. But alas---

"What are you playing at, Dino? I'm about to make my move, so you'd do your job quickly."

The peaceful moment had come to an end.

*Che, I really don't want to work.*

Dino had nothing against Beretta and Apito, in fact, he rather liked them very much. That was why he was even more disgusted by this order. But...orders could not be disobeyed. Thinking that it couldn't be helped, Dino decided to get serious.

![hard scene break]

After giving Dino another order, Feldway remained hidden and observed Cornu's battle. Cornu was a reliable subordinate, despite his tendency to be overconfident. He was also a comrade who had received his name from Veldanava, and Feldway believed him to be very useful to him. However, Cornu had made a terrible mistake in the last invasion, losing a third of his forces. This was in spite of their overwhelming superiority in terms of strength against one of the insignificant other worlds. That was reason enough for Feldway to be disappointed.

Cornu was also well aware of this, and this time, instead of using his usual style of playing with the enemy, he was desperately trying to finish the job. That was no fun for Feldway. The Three Phantom Commanders, who should be overwhelmingly strong, should not be at the mercy of the weak. Even now, Cornu had missed an opponent he could have killed with a single blow. He was unaware that Masayuki had been replaced by an impostor, and had fallen for the enemy's schemes. So furious that he was speechless, Feldway looked back and released a killing intent from his anger. He kept telling himself to calm down with his self-control until he barely managed to suppress his killing intent. Then, leaving Cornu alone, he moved to dispose of Masayuki.

![break]

On the other hand, Masayuki, who was on the run, felt very upset...

Every step felt heavy. He could not accept that he was the only one to escape. Of course, scary things were scary, but abandoning a friend was something even scarier. If anything happened to them, he would never be able to forgive himself for the rest of his life. Masayuki stopped in his tracks and looked back. He could see his companions fighting hard in the distance.

Minits blocked the enemy's movements, the vampires used their immortality as bait, and Calgurio and Venom attacked whenever they saw an opening. A special mention should be made of Jiwu's maneuvering, as she was able to position herself well to block Cornu's massive, destructive attacks. For a makeshift team, they really worked well together. However, if any one of them went missing, this team would fall apart.

"Hey, Masayuki..."

"Bernie, I'm going back. I was always afraid to talk about my true feelings because I didn't want my true identity to be exposed...but I really wanted to become better friends with everyone. I may be a coward, but I don't want to be a scumbag, you know?"

Masayuki spoke his mind. At that moment, the 'Voice of the World' sounded in his head.

![break]

<<Acknowledgement of the Hero's 'Courage not to Run.' This satisfies the three conditions and releases the hidden power of the Unique Skill 'Chosen One.' Do you wish to activate it? YES/NO>>

![break]

*Huh?* Masayuki was confused. He was worried that he'd done something wrong again, but was relieved to find out that wasn't the case. He wasn't interested in any hidden powers, but it was too late anyway, so he decided to approve it for now.

![break]

<<Confirmed, now adding a new power to the Unique Skill 'Chosen One'... Successful. From now on, 'Champion's Guide' will always be in effect.>>

![break]

A difficult explanation echoed in Masayuki's brain. Immersed in that nostalgic feeling, Masayuki began to understand his own skill. There was 'Champion's Aura' to intimidate his opponents, 'Champion Blessing' to make him super lucky, 'Champion's Charisma to give courage to his comrades, and 'Champion's Action' whose effects were unclear but had positive results, nonetheless. Those were Masayuki's current powers. The addition of 'Champion's Guide' seemed to be a power that could make him a heroic banner.

*Um, guiding the souls of the dead? I become a vessel? What the hell is that? If it's premised on the death of a companion, then I don't need this kind of skill...*

*Another useless skill*, Masayuki thought to himself. He hadn't expected much from it though, so he wasn't too disappointed. As long as things didn't get worse, that was enough for him.

"Masayuki, you..."

"So, Bernie, let's get back to the others."

Masayuki went back to the main topic. He was oblivious about his hidden powers.

"Okay. If you say that much, then I'll just go along with what you want."

Bernie scratched his head in resignation. The two smiled at each other and turned to go back to the others---and that's when things took a major turn.

![soft scene break]

Feldway made his move. He did not care about Bernie, but he knew he would get in the way if he wanted to take Masayuki. Bernie had let his guard down and could be slaughtered with a single blow. No, it wouldn't matter if Bernie was aware or not, because to Feldway, Bernie was nothing but a speck of dust. Without disturbing the wind, or showing even a hint of his presence, Feldway drew his sword and was about to cut off Bernie's head. However, what sounded was a clear resonating tone. It was the sound of a sword clashing with another.

"Who is in my way?! Who are you?"

His surprise was gone in an instant as Feldway asked who it was. The answer was given by a young 'masked' girl.

"I am Chronoa. I'm a Hero."

![full page image](image3)

There was a moment of silence. Then, Feldway started laughing.

"I never thought I would meet a hero here. In that case, let me introduce myself. I am Feldway. Phantom King Feldway."

Hearing his name, Chronoa remained unconcerned. She was in perfect sync with Chloe's consciousness, and was now a cold-hearted fighting machine.

"Phantom King? Hmph, so you're the master of the phantom tribe. I cannot overlook the evil you've done in front of me, so I've come out just in time to eradicate this threat to humanity."

"Fufufu, you are a bold one. I'll show you what it means to be self-aware, you fool."

As soon as he finished speaking, Feldway, in his bright red uniform, moved, and Chronoa, in her white 'Holy Spirit Armor', disappeared in a flash. The interplay of red and white lights glittered before Masayuki's eyes, and the two disappeared from sight at the same time, leaving only the sound of sword blades clashing in succession. Far from any shock waves, there was not even a whisper of wind. The battle was unfolding in an unimaginable realm. The masked girl, who had saved Masayuki before, had now saved him again from a crisis. Although Masayuki understood that, he was not sure that he could even do anything to help the girl who called herself Chronoa.

"Well, what should we do..."

"This isn't something we can do anything about. We can't afford to worry about it. We're on our own doing what we can, so let's go and help the others!"

Bernie sensed that it was him Feldway had targeted based on the sound of the sword strikes ringing in his ears. The fact that he had been completely unable to react to them at all told him that this enemy was on a different level. It was not because the current Bernie was weak, but because he and Feldway were so far apart in ability that they would not have even had a proper battle. If that was the case, then there was no point in going back and forth. The right thing to do was to act simply and decisively---Bernie demonstrated this way of thinking that had been drilled into him as a soldier.

"Okay. I don't know who this Chronoa person is, but I'll leave it to her!"

Masayuki was no stranger to improvising in the face of unexpected situations. That's why he decided to obediently leave the scene. And so, without regard to Masayuki and Bernie, Chronoa and Feldway crossed swords. However, that only lasted for a short time. In just a few seconds, countless attacks and defenses had been played. It seemed as if the battle would go on forever, but then Feldway realized something.

"Hahahahahah!! Oh, so it was here the whole time? I knew it. Veldanava-sama was also hoping for my victory!"

"What, all of a sudden?"

"Huh, it's none of your business. No, actually, since you and I will be companions from now on, I don't mind telling you."

"...?"

"Obey my command, Hope King (Sariel)!"

It was an absolute command. The Angelic Ultimate Skill could not resist Michael's 'Ultimate Dominion'.

"What... What did you do---?"

"Oh? So there is still a residual sense of self? As expected Chronoa, who is famed as the most powerful Hero. However, resistance is futile. In a matter of hours, you will fall completely under my control."

Feldway was delighted at his good fortune. Throughout history, the famed Hero Chronoa had been known throughout the Empire for her valor. The fact that the Hope King Sariel had sprouted within her seemed to be a blessing from God. Just as Feldway had hoped, Chronoa fell to her knees.

"I am Sariel. Give me your orders, Michael-sama..."

Chronoa's mask came off, revealing her true face and beauty as those cold words escaped her pretty, cherry blossom-colored lips. Feldway couldn't help but feel sure of his victory. And he was.

Thus, Feldway made an extreme error in judgment at this point. Between Cornu of the Three Phantom Commanders, one of his confidants, and the strongest Hero, even if she wasn't the main body---with these two, it would be easy to accomplish his goal, he thought. And so Feldway...

"Good. You will cooperate with Cornu and kill the boy. I have business on the surface, so I will leave the rest to you."

...left the labyrinth after giving his command.

![soft scene break]

Seeing Masayuki and Bernie running back, Venom really wanted to sigh up at the sky. Not that he had anything to complain about. He had sensed a terrifying presence swelling in the direction Masayuki had fled, and was beginning to despair that he had failed in his mission.

"I'm so relieved that you're okay!"

"Haha, it's too early to say that since we still have enemies."

"That's right."

Venom admitted as much.

*Cornu is strong. Despite the clear advantage we have in the labyrinth, he is overwhelming, not to mention winning, and now I don't even know if I can survive.*

But even so, as soon as he saw Masayuki's face, he felt relieved for some unknown reason. An inexplicable surge of confidence welled up within him, making feel as if there was always a way. Minits and Calgurio seemed to feel the same way, and their faces looked better than before.

"Kukuku, I know this is a bad time, but I'm having fun."

"I agree with you. Truly, it's as if I am sharing the battlefield with His Majesty."

The Imperial soldiers laughed. Even the vampires, who should have had nothing to do with it, seemed to be getting excited about the fight. Meanwhile, Cornu was in a state of confusion. Just as he was about to attack, another Masayuki had appeared. Cornu wondered if he had failed to grasp his location, but upon a second glance, he found that there were indeed two Masayukis. That meant that one of them was an impostor. Needless to say, one of them was Jiwu in disguise, and the other one was the real Masayuki.

"How dare you underestimate me! You're just a bunch of stubborn worms!!"

Even though he was furious, Cornu had no way to tell which one was the real one. His senses told him that they were equal in strength and that both were insignificant. That was why it was even more troublesome. If Cornu got serious, both could be involved and get killed. If that was the case, then there was no telling where they would escape to. Therefore, Cornu knew that he would have to tighten his nerves even more to avoid a wrong-handed kill. And that's when a helping hand appeared.

"Cornu-dono, is it? My name is Sariel. I come at the command of Michael-sama."

An unfamiliar girl, who flew in at such a high speed that his eyes couldn't keep up, offered to assist him herself. Cornu did not doubt her words. The girl who called herself Sariel had a hint of Michael about her, just as she had said.

"That would help. You should aim for the Masayuki on the right. Do not kill him, just take him alive."

Cornu had picked one at random, and fortunately or unfortunately, his choice was the real one.

"Understood."

Sariel nodded and turned her gaze to Masayuki. Masayuki sensed this and grew impatient...

Their eyes met.

*Um, Sariel? That girl seemed to call herself Chronoa before, but I have no idea how she got turned to the enemy's side in such a short time. I mean...*

Masayuki was confused and desperate, but Chronoa's beauty too stunning for him to feel any fear. Or rather, he had no time to feel it.

*What's going on?! This girl...is super cute!!!*

Masayuki was so shocked that he forgot that he was in the middle of a battle. If he had to describe her in one description---that's it! Saying she was a transcendentally beautiful girl would be more appropriate. Masayuki came to the same conclusion as a certain blond-haired demon lord.

*Don't wear a mask in the first place!*---Masayuki even started complaining about such pointless little things. However!

There was hope lurking behind those trivial thoughts. Sariel's hand went to her sword, and Masayuki was prepared to die. Perhaps this was the reason that a thought came rising up within him like a magic lantern.

*She's really a beautiful girl, isn't she? She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life...*

As soon as that thought bubbled up, Masayuki felt a vicious chill for some reason. His survival instincts were screaming at him, telling him that he shouldn't think any further. So he decided to trust those instincts.

*...Or not---Second place. That's right, the second most beautiful. After all, the most beautiful is still---*

What came to his mind at the time was the blue-haired beauty he had last seen in his original world.

*Yes yes, that's her! The kind and gentle type, and so mature and sexy---A perfect score...*

*Even in the face of death, Masayuki's fantasies were unstoppable.* However, that was the right decision.

![break]

<<Confirmed. The 'Champion's True Love' has been established. The fourth hidden condition has been fulfilled. The Unique Skill 'Chosen One' has evolved into the Ultimate Skill 'King of Heroes.'>>

![break]

*Huh? Masayuki was stunned.*

Rather than calling it love, it was more of an annoyance. Why was it being glorified as love? However, he felt too embarrassed to complain about it. But before that...

*Why did I get an Ultimate Skill without even doing anything?!! I have to earn up to it!!*

Masayuki shouted in his mind. It was too much---Masayuki even wanted to question the Voice of the World. However, even complaining about the results would not change anything. Moreover, even if he received an Ultimate Skill that he did not know how to use, it was still impossible to defeat Sariel in front of him.

*It's an amazing power, but it's too late now. Well, I did my best, so I might as well go out in style.*

Thinking this, Masayuki gave a refreshing smile. The effect was tremendous.

"Protect His Majesty!!"

The other soldiers, who had previously been keeping at a distance because they were in the way, began to launch suicide attacks without any regard for their own lives. This was the effect on those further away, so the change of those close by was even more dramatic.

"Power is welling up. I feel as if I can't lose!"

Shouting loudly, Calgurio slashed at Cornu. Calgurio had been on the defensive up until now, but his sudden desperate attack scared Cornu, if only for a moment. Minits was not to be outdone.

"Listen up, imperial soldiers! Let the His Majesty the Emperor give witness to our bravery!"

While shouting these words to inspire the soldiers, he himself did not take his eyes off of Sariel, constantly applying pressure with his 'Oppressor.' Normally, his Unique Skill would not work against an Ultimate Skill. However, this time, the attack succeeded in forcing Sariel to retreat, though only slightly. The vampires were also very active.

"This is incredible! I'm feeling great right now, as if I can do anything!"

Someone was laughing while forcing an attack, even though the lower half of his body had been blown off by his recklessness.

"Take this!! Eat my energy cannon with all your strength!!"

People began repeatedly dying and resurrecting over and over again.

"Hyahahahahaha! This is so much fun!!"

Someone who specialized in regeneration began protecting solders from stray bullets without giving any thoughts about the consequences. The crowd had become beyond fierce and were launching an even fiercer onslaught of attacks than before. How were they able to do so? It was, of course, all thanks to Masayuki's skill. Unlike his previous 'Unique' level skill, his new Ultimate Skill 'King of Heroes' could provide the minimum protection needed to fight against ultimate skills. Only those with an existence value of at least 100,000 could withstand the ability, however those who did not have such a value still received a blessing of luck. Anyone who was a follower of Masayuki would be under his protection. A true balance breaker.

It was an uncanny power that could turn the tides of battle simply by having him on the battlefield. If Masayuki had not seen Chloe Aubert's true face, then he never would have awakened the ultimate skill. One only had to think about it that way to understand what a major faux pas Feldway had committed. In any case, the battle fell into a temporary stalemate, barely maintaining its equilibrium for more than ten minutes.

![break]

Of course, it was impossible to defeat the duo of Cornu and Sariel. However, the winner had already been decided. The moment Masayuki had acquired the Ultimate Skill 'King of Heroes,' the path ahead was clear. And now, thanks to the warriors who bought their time, the moment had come. Velgrynd had vanished from this world. At the same time, the gears of fate began to shift...

![soft scene break]

<<Confirmed. A 'Soul Corridor' with the individual named 'Velgrynd' has been established across time and space>>

![break]

*Huh?*

Just as Masayuki was becoming more confused, that person appeared. At first, he thought it was just an enormous mass of energy. But that wasn't the case. It was a humanoid figure. The form of a very beautiful, nostalgic, woman. With a crimson aura of supremacy that illuminated her distinctive brilliant blue hair, the 'Scorch Dragon' Velgrynd had now manifested. Her eyes contained a domineering aura that could make all beings fall flat. No one could even move, as if time itself had been frozen. Cornu, too, was bewildered by the suddenness of the situation, and stared at Velgrynd. The same was true for Sariel, who was waiting for Cornu's instructions. That was the limit of a person with a newborn ego.

All of the Imperial soldiers present understood instantly. The person before them was the most powerful being who had protected the Empire for so long. It had been reported that she was currently engaged in battle with Veldora, but that did not seem to be the case. Because Velgrynd was now hugging Masayuki in a deep embrace. In anyone's eyes, this was the way one acted when facing their beloved.

"I've been looking for you for a long time, Rudra. Always, always, always, longing to see you..."

After saying that, Velgrynd's eyes welled with tears as she looked at Masayuki. Then, she gently put her hands on his cheeks, bringing him into a passionate kiss...

![full page image](image4)

Masayuki was stunned.

*Hey, so soft... No, it's sweet? No, no wait...!*

His head imploded and his cool judgment was lost in an instant. This terrifyingly beautiful woman had hugged him, which was okay, but the problem was what followed afterward.

*Fir---First kiss!!!*

The casual coordination of her shirt and jeans was slightly more mature, and combined with Velgrynd's beauty, exuded a cool aura.

*It would be a lie to say that I'm not happy to be kissing such a beautiful woman.*

However, there was a key point that should not be left out. This beautiful woman had referred to Masayuki as Rudra.

*Oh no, she must have the wrong person...*

In this atmosphere, there was no way to tell her that she had gotten the wrong person. That said, this beauty was still kissing him even now. Masayuki felt like he was going to run out of breath soon.

*Be cool, be calm, it's times like these when one needs to keep their cool---Masayuki checked the situation once again.*

His location was on the battlefield. Right in front of the enemy. Locked in a hot kiss with a beautiful woman. Moreover, because he was in such close contact with this beautiful woman, he couldn't help but be aware of the touch of her ample breasts.

*It's almost too comfortable as if I'm ascending to heaven...but I must not enjoy it now! What the hell am I doing?! I---*

The more Masayuki thought about it, the more confused he got. The only thing he understood was that the moment he was exposed as the wrong person, his life would be over in an instant. Now that he had done this in front of so many people, there was no excuse. Even with Masayuki's good fortune, this situation could not be expected to improve. A situation where he was enjoying a heavenly good fortune, while waiting for the promise of misfortune that was waiting for him. Masayuki stopped thinking.

Since he was about to die anyway, he might as well be grateful that he could experience kissing at the end. He came to that conclusion and resigned himself to it. His consciousness was gradually getting hazy as Masayuki's face grew dreamier. Now that he had made up his mind, all he had left to do was enjoy the situation. And that attitude only accelerated the misunderstanding of the onlookers.

"His Majesty is so skilled."

"It might be a bit disrespectful, but I feel the same way. It is a privilege to witness the unwavering love of two adults who look at each other with such deep affection. I can sense the unshakable bond that leaves no room for anyone else."

"Fufu, Velgrynd-sama is like a maiden in love... Fufufu, so the guardian dragon of the empire is in love with His Majesty."

"Yes! Now the empire will be safe!"

Not a single person harbored any ill feelings towards Masayuki. In fact, no one even had the slightest doubt that Masayuki was the real Rudra.

Masayuki wanted to shout out that this was a big misunderstanding, but Velgrynd was still keeping mouth shut.

*In the first place, I've never even had a girlfriend, so don't go talking about marriage!!*

Masayuki lamented the absurdity of this world. In the end, it was the enemy Cornu of all people, who rescued Masayuki from this situation.

"Don't be ridiculous, Velgrynd! You're supposed to be under Michael-sama's control! So why are you getting in my way?"

From Cornu's point of view, Velgrynd was just one of the pawns that had already been conquered. And now that she had shown up to get in his way, he erupted in discontent and anger.

"Hey, that's just tactless. There's a limit to how stupid you can be for interfering with us."

Velgrynd, who had finally separated from Masayuki, glared sullenly at Cornu. Though frightened by her gaze, Cornu could not stop himself.

"Shut up! Stop playing around and just cooperate. That that guy you're holding, strangle him to death!!"

That was a forbidden sentence. It had never occurred to Cornu that his words would touch Velgrynd's reverse scale.

"Just now, did you just tell me to kill this man?"

The battlefield went silent. Only Cornu failed to comprehend the situation, and shouted in his own anger.

"Don't make me repeat myself, Velgrynd. You may be stronger than me, but I am the superior authority here. All you have to do is follow my orders!"

Until the very end, Cornu did not recognize the current situation. He never got the time to realize that Velgrynd different than before.

"You're going to die."

It was a merciless blow. The newly reborn Velgrynd was much stronger than before. With her sophisticated magic power manipulation, she burned Cornu cleanly to the ground. Far from fighting back, Cornu disappeared from the world without leaving room for a single retort. What was even more terrifying was that Velgrynd's attack even spanned time and space. This was the true essence of the 'Spacetime Continuous Attack' that made full use of Velgrynd's newly acquired 'Dimension Leap' ability. Cornu's main body in the other world was instantly wiped out before even being allowed to feel the threat.

"I let you off the hook last time, but you really are stupid. I'd almost forgotten about my grudge against Feldway, but I guess I shouldn't have let it go."

Velgrynd spat out and then turned her attention to Sariel.

"Oh, this person is really Chronoa, someone who helped me..."

"Don't worry, I won't do anything, because there's no need. Michael's control of the Ultimate Skill 'Hope King Sariel' seems to have given it an identity, but that girl is resisting it on her own volition. The fact that she's stopped moving is proof of that. If you're still worried, just let Rimuru take a look later. I'm sure he'll take appropriate measures. Although, I don't think that will be necessary."

Velgrynd finished speaking as she turned away from Sariel---Chronoa. After seeing Velgrynd's completely unconcerned expression, Masayuki finally felt relieved.

![soft scene break]

And so, the battle had ended. While there were many people who were as relieved as Masayuki, there were also others who became nervous and started fidgeting from awkwardness. It was those who knew Velgrynd's identity who were disturbed. Bernie, who was standing next to Masayuki, was the first who was determined to act. Because he was standing closest to Velgrynd, he jumped forward and dropped to his knees. He then spoke with such momentum that he almost fell flat on his face in prostration.

"Lord Marshal, I am Bernie, 7th of the Single Digit hierarchy! May peace be with you, Lord Marshal."

"No need to salute. So, what are you trying to say?"

"Yes! I disobeyed the Commander's order and abandoned my mission to eliminate this boy Masayuki. I understand that my crime is worthy of death, but before I am punished, there is something I would beg of you, Lord Marshal."

Again, the entire place fell silent. The soldiers who had been listening to Bernie's statement finally realized that Velgrynd was the Marshal, the supreme leader of the Imperial Guard.

Quite a few people were confused, but most of them were convinced. As the understanding gradually deepened, reality finally dawned on them. Those perceived as losers would be punished by Velgrynd. It was useless to resist her. In the face of an absolute Marshal who would destroy even this labyrinth, they had no choice but to wait for her judgment. Naturally, they began to line up and wait for the judgment to come. In this tense atmosphere, the conversation continued.

"What is it?"

"Our loyalty to the Empire is unchanging. Whatever His Majesty the Emperor wills, we know that we must obey his orders. Therefore, I would ask your permission for the soldiers to return home! The executives, including myself, have no complaints about taking responsibility of their punishment, but---"

"That's enough."

Bernie despaired when he was interrupted. He felt like crying at his own helplessness, thinking that he could not reverse their fate after all. But when Velgrynd saw Bernie, she chuckled.

"Oh, dear, did you misunderstand me? You've all done a great job for a bunch of fools, and I commend you for that. I thank you for protecting my beloved Rudra."

All of the solders fell down to their knees and hung their heads in unison.

"So then...?"

"I had no intention of doing anything to you guys in the first place. All that matters to me is Rudra, and because Rudra cares about you guys, then I will protect you all as well. That is how it was before, how it is now, and how it always will be in the future."

Velgrynd's words were like gospel. The soldiers erupted in cheers. Some shed tears of joy. Calgurio and Minits were no exception, deeply moved and convinced by Velgrynd's words. In the end, the crowd was endlessly chanting 'Long live the Empire! Long live His Majesty!' while Masayuki was standing there wondering what the hell they were even talking about.

*If I'm hearing what they just said correctly, then they really have mistaken me with Emperor Rudra. I should have pointed it out already. Besides, Bernie already knows the truth. If it's exposed, I'll be the one who gets in trouble. And the kiss...the kiss... I'll definitely be killed...*

Masayuki's name was not Rudra, but for some reason, no one was asking any questions. It made him feel like he was going crazy or something. To be honest, Masayuki was overjoyed about the kiss. However, he sincerely felt that it was not his intention to get involved.

"You look upset, what's wrong? If something is still bothering you, you can tell me."

Much to his dismay, Velgrynd returned here attention back to Masayuki who had been left alone.

"Huh? No, no, it's nothing. I don't have anything on my mind..."

He replied a bit incoherently. Seeing Masayuki's unnatural attitude, Velgrynd's expression became worried as she began asking warily.

"Perhaps you do not remember me?"

Masayuki felt like he was being tested for the correct answer. The consequences of an incorrect answer were unimaginable. Even though all he wanted to say was 'Give me a break,' Masayuki desperately tried his best to use his brain. If one asked whether he remembered her or not, he did. That beautiful woman he had last seen in his original world was definitely her. In that case, did he know her name?

*That guy just now, called her Velgrynd, right? I think that Velgrynd was Veldora-san's sister...and the rumors were that she was strong to the point of being outrageous. And she was said to be a guardian of the empire or something...*

Masayuki's desperate thinking was paying off, as he gradually recalled more and more information. Judging by the reaction of the Imperial soldiers, Masayuki decided that his guess was correct, and took a gamble.

"Velgrynd...san, wasn't it?"

Velgrynd's face broke out in happiness when she heard the answer.

"Yes, that's right! You remembered me, Rudra!!"

Luck had yet to abandon Masayuki here either. Just him saying her name made Velgrynd very happy. And that wasn't all.

"Oh, now I understand why you were looking so glum. I was so happy to see you that I forgot that your name is Masayuki now."

"...!!"

The situation had improved all on its own, and even Masayuki's concerns about his mistaken identity were resolved.

*Eh, eh, eh, eh?! Does this person even know that I am Masayuki Honjou?*

What an absolute relief. It was the first time in his entire life that he had felt such a deep sense of relief. He was so relieved that he almost peed himself, and then hurriedly pulled himself together.

"Yes, that's right. Actually, my name is Masayuki, not Rudra. That's why I'm a little confused."

Masayuki grinned amiably, while also cautiously observing Velgrynd's reaction. Besides, it wasn't just Velgrynd, but also the soldiers of the Empire who were a problem.

*According to the conversation just now, they think that I'm Emperor Rudra, right? But if I tell them that I'm not the emperor at this point, they'll all be confused. I would be charged for perjury by the emperor, and then I'd have to prove my innocence!*

He didn't know if there was such a charge or not, but he still wanted to make things clear. So, Masayuki decided to convey his thoughts. Velgrynd, however, did not care.

"There's no problem at all. The value of the empire is nothing more than Rudra's property. It was just Rudra's hobby that led him to build it, and he kept it because it was necessary for his game with Guy. If you don't want it anymore, why don't we just scorch it clean?"

It was truly a statement of something transcendent like the divine. The Imperial soldiers' faces all paled. All their eyes pierced into Masayuki.

*St-Stop it! Don't look at me like that!! Don't blame me!!!*

Masayuki opened his mouth while feeling the weight of an unnecessary responsibility.

"No, the empire is important! Rimuru-san also wanted to be friends with them in the future. When the war is over, let's establish diplomatic relations---friendly relations."

In short, Masayuki desperately insisted that the Empire must not be turned into a scorched earth. All of the Imperial soldiers began looking at Masayuki with worshipful eyes, as if he were a god. Velgrynd was a 'just do it' type of person, and it didn't take much effort for her to do what she said. If Masayuki hadn't opposed it, the empire would have been destroyed. Everyone understood this, which was why their appreciation towards Masayuki was so great.

"Really? If you say so. Then I'll just continue to cooperate as usual."

With that, Velgrynd flashed a smile. For their part, the Imperial soldiers breathed a sigh of relief. In the midst of this, Calgurio spoke up on behalf of the group with a question.

"I am sorry to interrupt you just now even though things have been settled, but there is one thing I would like to confirm."

His expression was grave, and it was clear that he was hesitant to say anything.

"What is it?" Velgrynd asked.

"Yes! It is about Rudra-sama, the current Emperor. What will happen next for His Majesty Rudra?"

Upon hearing this, Velgrynd also expressed her understanding.

"Oh, that's right. After all, you guys can't see the true nature of the soul, can you? The Rudra now is nothing more than an empty shell. But the real Rudra's soul was gathered by my beloved Masayuki."

"Huh? Me?"

"Yes. Even without your memories, there is no doubt that you are 'Rudra,' so I love you and will try to make you love me too."

"Uhhh, yeah."

Is there any man who wouldn't get excited after being told that by a beautiful woman? No, there isn't! Masayuki was no exception. Although she was in love with him now, there was no guarantee that her love would last forever. So in order to hold onto his good fortune, he vowed work even harder. What exactly he would do, however, was a matter left for the future. Masayuki had made his decision, but there was still another problem.

"Then we must make Masayuki-sama the true Emperor!"

"Huh?"

"That's right. But it might be difficult. In terms of bloodline, he's of a completely different pedigree. It won't even work if we say he is the emperor's illegitimate son. There would be no way to cover it up."

"Wait, what?"

"It doesn't matter. The army will be suppressed by Calgurio-dono, and I will handle the nobility. It's okay, they won't be able to argue. If we fail, the empire will be destroyed anyway, so we can't afford to take any chances."

When Calgurio set the course, and Bernie raised the issue, it was Minits who offered the solution. The soldiers present were all willing to support the plan to the best of their ability. And just like that, before Masayuki had a chance to interject, the plan moved forward step by step...

"Good luck with that, Masayuki."

*That...I don't have the right to refuse?*

Probably not, so Masayuki gave up. His legendary life was only just beginning.

![hard scene break]

Dino decided to take things seriously. It was a very annoying situation where he was struggling against an opponent he could easily defeat, but that was over now.

"You can't afford to look the other way, can you?"

The words fell out and Beretta's sharp fist slice across his cheek.

"What an underestimation. I can't believe you're taking us on with your head in the clouds."

Apito's Osiris Rapier also flew by. The sting was sure to be painful---Dino did his best to avoid it.

*I thought I was far superior to these guys, but was I just being overconfident? Even with two opponents at the same time, I didn't think I'd be having such a hard time.*

Dino felt a little unsure of himself, wondering if he had become weaker after slacking off for such a long time. The fact that he had time to think about it was proof that he still had the strength, but not the self-awareness. Apito, thanks to her training with Hinata, had acquired an intuition that could almost predict the future. The difference in ability between Apito and Dino was obvious, but Apito was still an opponent to be reckoned with. Beretta acted as a shield, and Apito attacked from behind. Beretta would also occasionally join in the attack, so the two of them could reach Dino.

And Beretta's magic was even more troublesome. Dino was immune to most spells, but Beretta's magic was predominantly the support type. In other words, Beretta's magic was not used to attack Dino directly, but to strengthen his own physical values. Weakening Dino's magic was ineffective, but there was no way to interfere with spells that increased the speed, strength, or durability of Beretta or Apito. In that case, all he had to do was to interfere with the activation of the spell, but Beretta, being a demon who was good at magic, could unleash magic without even thinking about it. Moreover, Beretta was immune to the Unique Skill Sloth's 'Fallen Hypno.' Because of this, Dino had been struggling. But now, that was finally over. The long-awaited feeling had finally accumulated, and it was time to fight back.

"Shut up! Two people teaming up to bully a weak man like me, and yet you talk so high and mighty! It's only because I'm patient that I've been able to keep you guys company. You should be grateful! Take this and get some rest!!"

By the time he had finished saying this, the Fallen Hypno had been activated. As was typical of Dino, there was no concept of fairness in his dictionary.

"Phew, is it finally over?"

Seeing Apito fall to her knees, Dino was convinced of his victory. His eyes turned their attention to Beretta---only to be met with an incoming fist that he scrambled to avoid.

"Whoa, you resisted my sleep?!"

"Of course I did. It was a mistake to get caught even once, so how could I get caught twice?"

It was because the demon race was resistant to abnormalities that Beretta was able to devise a countermeasure. With his Unique Skill 'Double-Crosser,' he was able to reverse the drowsiness.

"Seriously..."

"Well, it's too bad for Apito, but I'll just let her die and come back to life."

Beretta remained calm in front of Dino. Dino was more impressed than dismayed by the way he was so obediently following the logic of victory.

*I can't believe he's managed to keep things this even until now with me as an opponent. It's not because of me, but because Beretta and the others are so good. In that case, I'll have to use that...*

Dino had a secret move.

He didn't want to use it, because it would bring back terrible memories, but now there was no other choice.

"I'll admit it. You should be proud of yourself for making me take you this seriously."

As soon as Dino shouted this, he unleashed the power that he had sealed away. Ultimate Skill 'Heavenly King Astarte'---the ultimate skill given to him from Veldanava.

![break]

<<Confirmed. The evolution of the Unique Skill 'Sloth' through the 'Creation' of the Ultimate Skill 'Heavenly King Astarte'... Successful>>

![break]

Dino's 'Sloth' had a special nature---the lazier he usually was, the more powerful his strength would increase. To put it simply, it was possible to accumulate energy. Dino took advantage of this, and evolved the Unique Skill 'Sloth' into the Ultimate Skill 'Sloth King (Belphegor)'. That was Dino's secret move. The 'Creative Evolution' of the Ultimate Skill 'Heavenly King Astarte'. If one uses the power of the Ultimate Skill 'Heavenly King Astarte', they can achieve their desired evolution, though it is limited to their own Skill. Of course, that wasn't everything, but Dino wanted to preserve his Ultimate Skill 'Heavenly King Astarte'. This was because the labyrinth was under constant surveillance, and things were constantly being recorded. Dino, as a Watcher', was reluctant to expose everything about himself. Also---

*That Rimuru guy is terrifyingly intelligent with an abundance of resources. Even when he took out Clayman, he brought out recorded footage as evidence. If my power is exposed, then he'll easily be able to take countermeasures.*

Demon Lord Rimuru was not an opponent to be underestimated. When it came to him, Dino knew that there was no such thing as too much caution. That is why Dino created the 'Sloth King Belphegor' as a power he could show. Now, that power was targeting Beretta.

"Now sleep! 'Fallen Catastrophe'---!!"

The laws were rewritten, and the positive factors began to regress to the negative factors. This temptation, regardless of whether the person was alive or dead, lead them from a state of activity to a state of cessation. However, there was no compulsive force to this, and the target of the attack would voluntarily walk the path to destruction. This could be considered a type of hypnotism, except that the effect reached different dimensions. One would not be able to awaken from the slumber of the evolved 'Sloth King Belphegor.' It destroyed not only the mind, but also the body. In this case, however, the guided destination was 'destruction', but it was also possible to lower the level and limit it to abnormalities such as sleep. It was a very versatile Skill. Because this power did not use sound as a medium to transmit the interference waves, it could not be prevented by physical 'barriers' or the like. It was worth mentioning that there were very few means of defense. Absolute domination over those who possessed wisdom and feelings---that was the power of the 'Sloth King Belphegor.'

![soft scene break]

Truly the terrifying ultimate evolution of one of the seven deadly sin series, 'Sloth.'---Dino was impressed by it. He tried to destroy Beretta carefully so that he would not be able to move for a while. That is why 'destruction' had been chosen, but now it proved to be more powerful than expected. Beretta had vanished into the dust, and it would take some time for him to recover. The bracelet had also disappeared with him, but Dino didn't care, thinking that Ramiris' power would be able to handle it. Furthermore, if he had gone easy on Beretta, he would have failed in his mission.

*Don't blame me if you die*, Dino thought irresponsibly.

*But hey, even Beretta is only a mid-tier player amongst all Demon Lord Rimuru's subordinates...*

It was only natural that Dino felt like complaining. Even an opponent as troublesome as Beretta was still only a lower-ranking existence who had yet to acquire an Ultimate Skill. Moreover, he wasn't even the demon lord himself, but merely a subordinate. Dino thought while shuddering at the fact. If the upper ranking members of the labyrinth had remained...

Would he even have been able to win by himself? Annoyed, Dino turned his attention to Ramiris. He saw that Ramiris was sleeping, and touched her body. He should have been able to touch her.

![break]

Ramiris turned into a particle of light. Then, taking the form of a butterfly, began to fly around Dino. It seemed to be mocking him.

*---H-Hey, no way. Am I hallucinating...?!*

He didn't want to believe it, couldn't believe it. But there was no other way to explain the situation. Sure enough, this battle was being monitored.

*I'm glad that I was cautious, but still...*

One of his trump cards was also exposed to the enemy. And...

His next opponent would surely be far more dangerous.

*Clack, clack, clack* the click of footsteps rang out.

The beautiful butterfly of light fluttered like a dance to the man who approached slowly, stopping at his arm. The butterfly turned back into a particle of light, and then changed its form again...into the innocent, sleeping Ramiris who had a blissful expression on her face, seemingly unaware of anything around her. Beretta, who had somehow been resurrected, reverently received Ramiris, who had made his forearm her bed.

"Beretta-dono, please take care of Ramiris-sama."

The man spoke quietly.

"Yes, leave it to me. Do you need support?"

"No need. I alone am enough."

From the very beginning, Ramiris' escort had been foolproof. Deep in the safest part of the labyrinth, many heavy traps were laid out. All according to a certain someone's instructions, orders were sent out to the battle forces to fight in small, gradual bursts in order to expose the abilities of the encroaching enemy. And above all, this labyrinth had the strongest of guardians. Before leaving the labyrinth, Veldora had entrusted the protection of Ramiris to his trusty disciple and confidant. Ramiris was the only one who did not know about it. And now...

That person was on the move. The man standing before Dino was the 'Mist Lord' Zegion. The absolute powerhouse of this labyrinth.

![full page image](image5)

![soft scene break]

Zegion had cocooned himself for the sake of his evolution, but his consciousness had always been kept awake. In response to Veldora's request, he grasped the situation in the labyrinth perfectly. With the overwhelming blessing of 'Absolute Defense,' he was able to ensure Ramiris' safety. Dino recognized this as well.

*Seriously, you've got to be joking...*

Those were Dino's honest feelings. Just when he thought he had finally beaten the enemy, a new one suddenly appeared, all the while with the purpose of exposing his own hand.

*I knew it! That Rimuru is such a cunning bastard, of course he would prefer this kind of tactic!*

At this point, the operation has failed. Forget about capturing Ramiris, Dino's own escape had now become a difficult problem.

*Besides that, when did he even evacuate Ramiris in the first place? I was in this room the whole time and even saw Ramiris talking. She turned into a butterfly, so she should've been long gone by then, right?*

If that wasn't the case, then that meant Zegion had let Ramiris escape in a way that even Dino couldn't see.

*---But if that's true, then... I've been talking to an illusion this whole time?*

If so, then that was also a big problem. It was an unusual state of affairs. Dino is an Ultimate Skill holder, and is also well versed in hypnosis. Even so, it seemed Zegion had left Dino in a state of hallucination, which should have normally been impossible. However, the possibility could not be dismissed in its entirety. If Zegion also possessed an Ultimate Skill and was proficient in mental attacks...then there was still the possibility that he could use illusions that were enough to fool even Dino.

Dino also knew how powerful Zegion was. He was a powerful humanoid of the Insectar race and was also of the Demon Lord Seed. He was favored by the Demon Lord Rimuru, and had acquired extraordinary fighting abilities. It was heard that Zegion had taken Veldora as his teacher, and that his fighting skills were even superior to those of the 'primordials'. That was Zegion, the one regarded as the absolute king of the labyrinth.

When the Imperial Army had invaded the labyrinth, Zegion had eliminated the intruders with an overwhelming power. At that time, Dino had taken the opportunity to observe the fight and concluded that Zegion was invincible in physical combat. However, the most important point here was that he had only been fighting physically. He hadn't used any mental or spiritual attacks, let alone an Ultimate Skill---he hadn't even seemed to use a Unique Skill.

*---No. Is his Distortion Field skill alone strong enough to reach the ultimate level...?*

Still, it was a physical ability, and Dino, who was good at mental attacks, thought that it was still manageable. At this point, the only thing that came to his mind was the celebration from the other day. On that day, Demon Lord Rimuru had granted Zegion some kind of power. Under the guise of a celebratory reward, he had initiated an evolutionary ritual that awakened his subordinates who had distinguished themselves in battle. In fact, some of them, such as Gabil and others, had greatly increased their power and had entered the slumber of evolution. It was a phenomenon very similar to the Harvest Festival for demon lords, and it was also no wonder that Zegion had acquired new skills.

*But isn't that still strange? How is it that even his subordinates can evolve into the same realm as the lord Rimuru?! I can understand if the subordinates of an awakened demon lord are at the level of Demon Lord Seed, but even his subordinates are at the level of an awakened demon lord---that's too much of a foul!!!*

This was a phenomenon that even Dino, who had lived for a very long time, could not have predicted. Even Guy could not have done such a thing.

*---No, once it's all said and done, this is unending. In the first place, the fact that he uses the 'primordials' as mere subordinates is insane. With a guy like that, no matter what he does, it shouldn't even be a surprise anymore.*

Dino was inwardly cursing at Rimuru. As the strongest of all demons, they could have easily stopped Dino in his tracks. The superiority and inferiority of existence values could not be a reliable factor with a 'primordial' as an opponent. For Rimuru to take such existences as his minions was completely abnormal in Dino's eyes. Dino had thought it's best to stay uninvolved as much as possible. And yet...

The Zegion in front of him was comparable to those primordials. He was clearly foreign. More than just becoming a Million-class, his domineering aura gave the impression of endless power. A power that transcended numbers---It was an aura that only those with the ultimate power could emit. It also implied that Zegion, like Dino, had acquired an Ultimate Skill.

*This is why I hate working...*

Dino lamented having drawn the short end of the stick. Exhaling a sigh of resignation, he tried to look for the best solution forward, but good ideas were not easy to come by, and time waits for no one.

![soft scene break]

Zegion calmly walked up to Dino, who had been thinking long and hard.

"Is there anything else you would like to say?" He asked.

"Haven't you just been hiding from me all this time to force out my cards? Don't be ridiculous, it's despicable!"

Putting his own actions up until now on the shelf, Dino was the first to complain. He was just taking it out on him, but it would be helpful if the other party got angry.

"Ridiculous. This is a fight."

Of course, Zegion was unconcerned. Dino also realized this, and the conversation ended. Tension flared between the two. Dino knew Zegion's strength. This was an advantage for Dino, however, his trump card had also been exposed to Zegion. In that case, there was no other choice but to go head-to-head...

Zegion specializes in melee combat. Furthermore, although unconfirmed, it is highly likely that he possesses an Ultimate Skill. Dino, on the other hand, specializes in mental attacks. No, Dino is not limited to that if he uses his hidden skills, but he didn't want to expose his skills in this labyrinth.

*Well, I've already exposed a bunch of trump cards, but it would still be a huge loss to expose them again...*

And Dino also naively thought that it would be okay to just run away.

"Why do you not attack?"

Zegion's words were doubly stressful. The mere question almost made him stiffen, but Dino fought it back with all his strength.

"Hah! Don't underestimate me. No matter what, I am still a pillar of the Octagram. After living for so long, there is no way I would lose to a little chick like you!!"^[I'm not positive, but Dino might have briefly used Kasai dialect here.]

He then raised his greatsword up high and swung it down towards Zegion.

"Eat this and perish! Fallen Strike!!"

---There was no exchange of tricks, just a single deadly blow. It was a great move that Dino, a lazy man, did not want to waste. However, the power of this technique, 'Fallen Strike', was real. Dino had also applied the ability of his Unique Skill 'Sloth' to his swordplay, and had created the 'Phantom Flow style.' By hindering his opponent's perception, he could control the battle at his will. And now, the Unique Skill 'Sloth' had evolved into the Ultimate Skill 'Sloth King Belphegor.' The effect was incomparable, and the 'Phantom Flow style' had become more accurate and powerful. Although Dino was a bit of a pain in the ass, he still had a great sense of combat. But even so...

Dino had decided that fighting close combat with Zegion was still not a good idea. If his own abilities did not work, then the Phantom Flow would not be viable. In that case, there could be no more reservations---so Dino unleashed his special technique. This was the Fallen Strike, one of the few orthodox sword techniques of the Phantom Flow Style, and it contained Dino's full intentions. The intent was to incapacitate his opponent.

Even a mere glimpse of it could deprive the target of the will to live, as it contained special vibrations that stimulated negative emotions. It was not something that could be ignored like an illusion or a hallucination. It was impossible for the weak-minded to resist it. Only those whose mental power was strong enough to acquire the Ultimate Skill would be able to withstand the attack. Even then, it was impossible to go unharmed. The 'will of laziness' that Dino had poured into this attack would also cause physical destruction.

Even if one succeeded in evading it, the negative vibrations would be emitted from all directions. The mere exposure to them would diminish the target's energy, and their fighting ability would inevitably decline. After that, it was only a matter of taking advantage of that chance and stabbing the enemy with his sword. This technique, which could trick enemies with double or triple his strength, was the strongest blow that Dino could deliver with confidence.

The best way to get out of this situation was to kill Zegion without taking any chances. Although Dino was reluctant to do so, he was not willing to cut corners when it came to making things easier.

*Even Guy wouldn't be safe from a direct hit. So then, can you take it?*

Dino grinned, confident in his strike. Zegion has always seen only Dino's laziness, and probably did not expect him to use a big move all at once. Dino was convinced that everything went as planned. But Zegion did not move. It wasn't that he couldn't react, it was just that he had plenty of time to deal with it. Zegion confirmed the trajectory of Dino's sword and caught it just before it hit him. The mythical-grade greatsword "Kuzurekiba (Crumbling Fang)," which swung down from above, was powerful enough to shatter any material on earth. Zegion calmly met such a blow with his left-hand exoskeleton that had been transformed into hihiirokane.

"Idiot! You didn't even dodge my sword, and just took it head-on! I've won this battle!" Dino shouted.

The lazy act that he had been performing had finally come to fruition in this moment. Although, to tell the truth, it was neither an act nor a performance, but he just liked to think of it that way. It was the fastest attack the current Dino could release, but as expected, Zegion was able to catch it. This was unavoidable, since speed tended to be sacrificed in larger swords. But in exchange, the power was extraordinary. As if it was a trivial attack, Zegion had caught it with one hand. That in itself was admirable. But for now, Zegion's left arm must have received a tremendous impact.

*His left hand doesn't seem to be shattered, but I guess it will be useless for a while. He's still standing there, but I'll just have to be patient.*

Dino thought to himself, looking at Zegion, who seemed so unconcerned. However, this game was Dino's victory. Zegion's 'Distortion Field' is amazing, but it could only prevent physical attacks. Dino's ultimate 'Fallen Strike' would penetrate all physical barriers and go directly to Zegion.

*Letting my opponent mistake this for a physical attack with a big sword and drop their guard, when in fact it was a lethal mental-type attack being used---this is my victory.*

Zegion is indeed strong. That is why Dino predicted that Zegion would look down on him to show off his superiority. He knew that Zegion would not dare to evade the attack because he was good at melee combat.

"Hmm. Give me a break, man. I'm sure the bracelet will bring him back anyway, so I should collect Ramiris quickly."

Spitting that out, Dino turned towards Beretta. But at this point, there was a pause. *Something's wrong*, he thought. First of all, Beretta was not wary of Dino. In addition to the repeated battles, Dino's remaining magicule count was also low due to the fact that he had used his trump cards. Even so, Beretta would be no match for Dino, and yet, the look in Beretta's eyes still revealed the calmness of a victor. He couldn't see his true face under the mask, but it was still creepy.

"Do you think you can beat me?"

"Hohoho, you must be joking. I am not thinking about winning, it's just that you are not my opponent."

As soon as those words fell, Dino felt a strong chill. Dino hurriedly looked back at Zegion in a panic. Indeed, there was something unnatural about the Zegion who had stopped moving. The fact that he had not been shattered by a mythical-grade blow meant that Zegion's left arm was also of mythical-grade strength. If that was the case, then it was not surprising that he had a willpower comparable to that of a spiritual life form. It seemed correct to assume that he had an Ultimate Skill, which had been a concern earlier.

"No way...!"

"I'll ask you, is the effect of your attack delayed? Or did you really think that you could beat me with just one breeze-like blow that doesn't even tickle?"

*Damn it*, Dino thought.

There was no doubt about it, Zegion was the holder of an Ultimate Skill. Although it was unclear what kind of power it was, it was at least powerful enough to nullify Dino's spiritual attacks.

"You suspected that I possessed an Ultimate Skill, didn't you? If that was the case, you should have attacked me in more ways than one instead of taking such a mild approach. That lazy nature of yours is the reason why you lost this time."

"Don't talk as if you've won!"---in the face of such a shouting Dino, Zegion held out his left hand. When his clenched fist opened wide, five flashes of light shot out from it.

It was Zegion's 'Dimension Ray (dimensional cutting ray).'

"That hurts..."

Dino took evasive action as quickly as he could, and barely managed to avoid a fatal wound. However, his right arm was severed from the elbow down. It hurt so much that he wanted to cry out in pain, but now was not the time. His instincts were warning him that he would be in real danger if this continued.

"So you have an Ultimate Skill after all, huh? I didn't expect you to be able to neutralize my 'Fallen Thanatos (Hypnotic Induction of Death).' Don't tell me that mental attacks don't work on you, either?"

'Fallen Thanatos' was the lethal mental attack that Dino had put into his 'Fallen Strike.' It was effective as long as the opponent had a mind, so even if the target was a 'Clone,' it would affect the main body at a distance. It was a sure-fire power with no way of escape. And yet, Zegion looked as if nothing had happened after being hit. It was no wonder that Dino couldn't accept it. In order for him to win---no, in order for him to even escape from this place, he needed to figure out this mystery. Dino knew that he would never get an answer, but he couldn't help but ask Zegion.

"I am not obligated to answer that question."

Of course, Zegion was indeed ruthless. But then, a cold voice gave him the answer.

"---But I will answer for you, wretched one. This so-called dream, that is to say, the mystery. From the very beginning, you have been in the palm of my hand. Remember, I am the 'Mist Lord', King of the World of Illusion, and mental attacks are useless against me!"

This was the attitude of a strong man who showed mercy to his enemies. Hearing these words and deducing the facts from them left Dino stunned. The fact that his own ability had been neutralized meant that his opponent's ability was stronger. In other words, he realized that Zegion had evolved into an existence equal to---no, and existence even greater than himself.

*It's gotta be a lie, right?! His melee combat is so strong, and yet he's better at mental combat?! And this guy---he just said that he's the King of the World of Illusion? In other words, has he reached the point where he can create a 'unique world'? You've got to be kidding me!! How much stronger can he get?! It's impossible to win against this kind of opponent without preparation!!!*

Dino's Skill was the strongest of the deadly sin series, and had even evolved into an Ultimate Skill. But even so, Zegion was able to defeat it. It was no longer something that evolution could explain because Zegion should not have had an Ultimate Skill until just recently. Dino is definitely not weak. But this time, his opponent was very strong. No, rather he was too overpowering...

The mission to kidnap Ramiris was fundamentally wrong from the start, but as soon as Zegion had completed his evolution, it was guaranteed to fail. Realizing this, Dino sighed heavily and looked up to the heavens. At that moment, he saw a figure on one of the monitors, and was left completely speechless.

*Oh, Velgrynd...*

That blue-haired beauty was, without a doubt, Velgrynd. She was supposed to be fighting against the Demon Lord Rimuru outside the labyrinth after subduing Veldora, but now she was somehow with Masayuki and the others. What was even more worrisome was that Cornu was nowhere to be seen.

*No way, no way, no way!!*

Bad premonitions often come true. Dino understood this from experience.

*Hold on a minute!! There's just too much information for me to understand. That, is that...?! Velgrynd was supposed to be under Feldway's control, but was that a lie? Or did she escape from it? Either way, does that mean that Cornu was disposed of by Velgrynd? No, no, no, this...it's no longer a matter of combat failure, is it?*

Dino let his Thought Acceleration run at full speed as he tried to comprehend the current situation. In the end, he came to the conclusion that no matter how hard he tried, it would be impossible to go on with the operation. He had always been eager to run away from the very beginning, but at this point, he didn't even have the will to try anymore. For Dino, he had done good enough.

"Pray. He who has touched the depths of hell, repent for your sins and die! 'Dimension Storm!'"

From the very beginning, this location was a part of Zegion's dominant space. That pointed to one fact. No matter what Dino did, it was impossible for him to leave this realm. If Dino had used the powers he had reserved, there was a possibility that he could have seen a glimmer of light. However, even then, the odds would be so ridiculous that Dino had no regrets about giving up. In fact, the only other possibility he had now was...

A rainbow-colored storm swallowed Dino, and his existence was erased into nothingness.

It was, indeed, a supernatural high-energy storm. There was nothing Dino could do, and he disappeared from this world without leaving a single piece of flesh behind.

"Oh, were your prayers answered? Your bad luck is to be commended."

Zegion murmured. There was a small sound of something breaking coming from somewhere as Dino's existence seemed to be reborn. Zegion had a proper grasp of the situation. His voice remained calm, as everything unfolded as Zegion expected.

![soft scene break]

Outside the labyrinth, Dino awoke.

"Well, I guess I won the bet."

Dino let out a sigh of relief. His equipment was still intact, and there was no physical damage.

"No, this is something else. Ramiris was merciful enough to let me escape, right?"

After muttering that, Dino looked at the broken bracelet. It was a cheap bracelet that he had bought at a store in the labyrinth---yes, it was a Resurrection Bracelet. Because Dino hadn't recorded a save point, the resurrection point was still above the labyrinth. It was left in place as one of the escape routes, just in case something like this happened.

"Not giving me a real bracelet with an unlimited number of resurrections was meant to be a warning. But you could have eliminated the entire function if you wanted to, you naïve yet sweet fool."

Dino sadly muttered to himself. He had kept the item made by Ramiris, the target of kidnap, as a secret insurance. The fact that he was able to do such unprincipled things without hesitation was what made Dino, Dino. It was an inferior product that could only be used once, and it was made in large quantities by Ramiris. He had gambled his fate on it, but it seems that heaven was on Dino's side.

*I guess I'm still an angel, even after I fall.*

Thinking to himself, Dino looked around. He was planning to join his colleagues who were fighting Geld and the others, and retreat as quickly as possible. He also didn't forget to contact Zalario through 'Telepathy Net,' telling him that the mission had failed. Dino's colleagues had been tasked with obstructing the re-closing of the labyrinth in order to secure an escape route. Until Zalario came out, they were unable to escape either. Since the mission had failed, they should not stay much longer.

*But even so, that guy is way too strong! I really can't stand him---*Dino grumbled again, remembering Zegion.

Feldway would be furious, but Dino felt lucky to have survived.

*That said, this is probably the first time Feldway's plan has ever failed. Also, it seems like Cornu was taken out... I don't know how, but I really shouldn't be hostile to Demon Lord Rimuru...*

In fact, Dino, who had been reluctant about this mission from the start, wondered to himself why he had even agreed to it. The thought of what was to come made Dino feel depressed. All in all, since Zegion had become such a monster, it would be hopeless to conquer the labyrinth in a straightforward manner. Not only Zegion, but all of the higher-ranking executives of Tempest were monsters. He didn't even know what was happening with Rimuru and the others, but he could guess that something terrible had changed.

*That's why I didn't want to do this!!!*

Dino wanted to live in peace and quiet in the labyrinth. But still, all this had happened. Even though it was unavoidable as his job, he could not help but feel depressed.

*I don't know what Feldway is thinking, but he's probably not going to give up. But this really isn't possible...*

Just now was probably the best chance they could have gotten. Now that the opportunity was gone, Dino understood that there would be no next time. In addition, there was another problem.

*Aah, I won't be able to go back anymore because of this hostile relationship.*

The days of living in the labyrinth were very comfortable and easy for the lazy Dino. Even though it was work, helping Vesta was fun. He had become friends with Gabil, helping each other in various ways. Dino was also happy whenever the researchers made a discovery. Dino had developed sense of companionship with Vesta and the others as he spent his days without boredom. And one more thing.

Perhaps everyone had forgotten, but Dino was here under Guy's orders. In other words, he had been given an intelligence mission to report on the events occurring in the labyrinth. Dino doesn't think that Guy expected much from him, but he still felt it was a bit unbearable.

*He's a pain in the ass when he's angry...*

To be honest, it was super troublesome. It was just as troublesome to keep thinking about it, so Dino hurried towards where his companions were.

![soft scene break]

When Dino arrived at his companions' location, the battle was at a stalemate. The 'Barrier Lord' Geld was fighting against the muscular female warrior, Gracia. It was shocking that the two were fairly equal in strength. To Dino, it was a sight that really made him wonder if something was wrong with his eyes.

*If he's evenly matched with Gracia, does that mean his power is already greater than mine? You've got to be kidding me...to evolve into this...*

Geld's body was stained with blood, but Dino couldn't tell if it was his own or if it was his enemy's. After all, he didn't see the slightest sign of injury anywhere on his body. If the damage was caused by a mana attack, the effects of a healing potion would not be enough to heal the wound. Naturally, Gracia's attack would be mana tinged with the intent to destroy. The fact that Geld was unharmed by such an attack might be due to his incredible defensive power, or to his supernatural recovery ability. As Dino was pondering this, Gracia flashed her longsword before him. The blow sliced through Geld's scale shield and ripped open his arm. However, Geld was completely unfazed. He simply threw away his broken shield and took a new one out of his 'stomach' and held it up. Dino saw it.

There were no wounds left on Geld's arm.

*Aaaaaah, it's Ultraspeed Regeneration. It's skilled enough to heal even Gracia's attacks...*

Dino was not happy at all, even though he knew the answer.

"That's enough! You're so stubborn! You don't even change your stance when I attack you---are you crazy?!"

"Hmm? Is that so? I actually don't know much about it myself, but should I have praised you for your excellent attack?"

"You're being sarcastic! Damn it, if I don't kill you with one blow, the wound will heal right away. I should be the one praising your toughness."

With that said, Geld and Gracia resumed their fierce battle. Neither of them cared about their own injuries and did their best to take advantage of their opponent. Geld's meat crusher knife was flicked away by Gracia's circle shield as fierce sparks wildly flew about. Just that alone sent a shockwave rushing through the ground. Dumbfounded, Dino completely missed the chance to speak to Garcia. Geld had always been a behind-the-scenes, silver-tongued kind of guy. He had no outstanding record against the Empire, so Dino had thought lightly of him. But that was a terrible mistake.

*I get it now! The people of this country are all just crazy!!!*

Dino was forcibly convinced that he had finally found the truth. And above Dino's head, a fierce air battle was also underway.

"Ahhhh, dodging left and right is so annoying!"

"That's what I wanted to say. You don't even have wings to fly with, but you're so cocky!"

"Hmph, it's easy enough to manipulate gravity. Compared to that, I've had enough of this game of chase. Shall we end this now?"

"That's my line!"

The mysterious Kumara and the childlike Pico. The two bewitching girls looked quite good together, but their battle was intense. Pico unleashed a Black Thunder that covered the ground, charring the surface of the earth. Yet, for some reason, it was unable to take effect on Kumara's surroundings. It was only natural from Kumara's point of view. The Thunder Tiger Raikou, Kumara's pet and one of her tailed beasts, specialized in lightning attacks, so it only made sense that her defense against thunder would be excellent.

*This time it's my turn*---Kumara moved out with such intent. Driving her eight tails in a fluid motion, she launched a series of nine-tailed slashes. However, these were all blocked by Pico's spear movement. A high-pitched sound rang out on the battlefield. It was a truly even battle, forcing Dino to revise Kumara's fighting ability upwards in his mind.

*The Twelve Guardian Lords, huh? What a scary bunch.*

Dino admitted it honestly. Not one of them, but all of the members were a threat. That was safe to assume, Dino thought. Pico and Gracia, the former seraphim, were comparable to awakened True Demon Lords. They had been out of combat for a long time, so it was not a simple matter of comparing their strength, but they were definitely not weak. With the Tempest executives out of picture, Dino had originally thought that he and the two girls alone would be enough to conquer the labyrinth. Feldway had even taken the trouble to send in two of the Three Phantom Commanders, and had even entered the battle himself. It was a situation of absolute victory, but the results were as one could see. Dino almost felt dizzy in the face of this reality. Both Pico and Gracia seemed to have lost their composure, perhaps because they hadn't fought in a long time.

*No wonder*, Dino thought. Even though they had fallen, they were still the highest-ranked seraphim.

The once brilliant Seven Primordial Angels were struggling in a battle, and their pride must have been torn to pieces. Dino was no stranger to this, but he had already tossed all that aside.

"You two, fall back! We're retreating!"

Dino shouted. The two girls reacted, but seemed unhappy about it.

"We're just getting started, you know? Don't talk nonsense when I'm about to get serious."

"Shut up! From the moment you two came to fight, this operation was already in ruins!"

Pico and Gracia's role was originally to provide logistical support from the rear, but since there was a gap in the battlefield, it was more prudent to take part in it. The fact that they were caught up in the middle of a battle meant that the enemy's strength had exceeded their expectations. A tactical victory here would be completely meaningless in terms of strategy.

"Wait, you mean the mission failed?"

"Huh? Ahhhh, yeah, it failed. If it hadn't failed, I wouldn't have run away!"

"Huh?! But Feldway made the plan, right? How could that cautious, perfectionist Feldway misjudge the enemy's strength?"

"That's the way it is."

"It can't be. With Zalario and Cornu here, how could the mission still fail?"

"Because we already lost. I told Zalario to stand down, but that Cornu bastard was probably killed. In short, none of the goals were achieved, so there's no point in fighting anymore!"

"Is this a lie...?"

"Seriously, I really don't think that's possible..."

Pico and Gracia were speechless. In contrast, Geld and Kumara wore proud expressions.

"Hey, hey, does that mean you lost too?"

"Huh? I mean, don't ask me that! Don't you have the decency to pretend not to notice?"

Facing Gracia's question, Dino replied perfunctorily, as if he didn't care. Gracia was stunned, not by the failure of the mission, but by Dino's lack of remorse. In any case, there was no reason to doubt Dino's words. With their heads already cooled down, Pico and Gracia accepted the retreat.

"Damn it, don't think that you've won!"

"That will not happen. You were splitting your power to stop the labyrinth from recovering during the fight with me, weren't you? Next time, I hope I can face you in perfect condition."

"Huh. Ahahahaha! You saw that, did you? I like that. See you later!"

Gracia and Geld acknowledged one another and peacefully said their goodbyes. Pico and Kumara on the other hand...

"Your name was Pico, right? You get to keep your life for today!"

"Huh?! I wasn't even serious! You're the one who gets to keep her life!"

They glared at each other viciously, then grunted and turned their faces away from each other. Despite the completely different atmosphere, the two agreed to end the battle. With that, Dino and the others had successfully withdrawn from the scene.

![hard scene break]

Zalario always kept his cool. His role in this mission was to create a diversion, and he carried it out perfectly. The men he had brought with him were fighting on equal terms with the resistance in the labyrinth. This was a literal meaning, and not an act. It was surprising, but they would need to revise their intel on the enemy upwards. That is what Zalario concluded as he assessed the battlefield. Most notable were the two people in front of him. Charys and Treyni, two names that Zalario felt it necessary to remember. Still, Zalario concluded that he didn't need to get serious.

*Originally, I was told that there were only insignificant rabble left here, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I had thought that in order to intercept me, the enemy would exhaust all of the forces in the labyrinth, but there is still the strong one called Zegion. I hope Cornu and Dino can complete their mission before he wakes up.*

He was a little worried, but there was no mistake in the plan Feldway had made. Believing that, Zalario was able to enjoy the battle with confidence.

"Oh dear, Veldora-sama is going to laugh at me later when he learns I was at the mercy of someone who is cutting corners."

"Such fears are unnecessary. Veldora was defeated by Velgrynd and has fallen into our hands."

"That's not a very funny joke."

"It's no joke. You've noticed it, haven't you? That is why you are getting a bit impatient."

"..."

Charys was a majin of great strength. Even to Zalario, who had destroyed many dimensions, Charys belonged to an extremely rare group of excellent talents. Treyni, who harbored the spirit king, was also very talented, but not as much as Charys. The high-powered magic she excelled at was threatening, but because it didn't have much effect on Zalario, it was not much of a problem. Charys was similar. He deftly manipulated his energy, converging heat energy and shooting out high-powered heat rays. However, this could be nullified by Zalario's prided 'Distortion Field'. What Zalario really needed to be wary of was his accurate and calm judgment.

Unlike Treyni, Charys would always try all sorts of tactics against Zalario. He fought cautiously, as if he were checking the effectiveness of each move. Zalario knew from past experience that such opponents could not be taken lightly. But that was coming to an end. Charys had begun to grow impatient, losing the prudence from a moment ago. He was not going to enjoy this fight anymore.

*It's almost time*, Zalario thought.

"I'm sorry about this, but I think we should end this now. You have both been very brave, very strong warriors. But, alas, you are no match for me."

The difference in strength was obvious. The total amount of energy was also too much at Zalario's advantage. Most crucially, there was the issue of compatibility. Angels had an innate advantage over spirits. Charys and Treyni, who were rooted in the power of spirits, could not give decisive damage to Zalario, who was a former seraph, albeit a fallen one.

"It's a shame, but it looks like Triss has reached her limit. I will only be able to hold onto the Spirit King for a few dozen seconds. Charys-dono, do you have any plans left?"

"Unfortunately, no. But don't worry, Rimuru-sama and Veldora-sama have thoroughly trained me in the art of never giving up."

Despite the hopelessness of the situation, Charys laughs and said that the battle was just beginning. Seeing this, Treyni also smiled.

"In that case, I will go along with you. I will not let insolvents have their way in Ramiris-sama's labyrinth!"

Although they had taken a great deal of damage, their energy was sufficient. They still had a strong will to fight and showed no signs of giving in at all, much to Zalario's disgust.

"Truly, you do not appear to be the kind of fools who do not understand your situation, but are you really going to cling to life in misery until the very end? If you think that you can just be resurrected and have nothing to worry about, then you're mistaken."

According to Zalario's calculations, it would soon be time for Dino to take Ramiris out of the labyrinth. The labyrinth's unique 'immortality' was only made possible because of Ramiris' presence. Strictly speaking, if Ramiris just left the labyrinth, it would be fine, but if she left the labyrinth after losing consciousness, then all of the records would be reset. In other words, once Dino's mission was accomplished, Ramiris' followers would no longer be immortal. Zalario was aware of this, which is why he was taking it easy on Charys and Treyni and letting them accumulate damage.

"Your fighting ability is worthy of praise, so if you wish, I can give you a painless and proud death."

That was Zalario's way of showing mercy to the strong. But of course, Charys and Treyni answered with a rejection.

"Fufufu, you think you've won? How foolish."

"I agree. In a battle, you never know what will happen until the very end. As long as you don't give up on your victory, you won't lose, but you don't even know that, do you?"

That defeatist remark was enough to provoke Zalario, and while he had not yet lost his cool, it was enough to make him feel agitated and uncomfortable.

"How unpleasant. It's rare that I would want to show you a little mercy."

"Mercy, is it? There are a lot of people who have been defeated after saying that they were going to win in the end. Don't you know that that's called a 'doom flag?'"

Charys recalled having a discussion with Veldora about the 'list of things you should not say or do.' There were many of them, but the 'showing off and taking it easy when you're about to win' in particular, was an absolute no-no. Once you decide to kill your opponent, you must do it quickly without saying a word. If you don't, you will surely be caught by your opponent with a counterattack.

"How foolish, as if a miracle in this situation---"

"---Will show up. Because Rimuru-sama has performed miracles many times. The people under his command have long become used to such instances, and there are even quite a few who have started to imitate them. Even now as well, you see!"

In the first place, by being in this labyrinth, even stalling for time was often enough to turn the situation around. This time was no exception---

"...That's right. And if you dare to go after Ramiris-sama, a friend and ally of my God, then I, the 'Gehenna Lord' Adalmann, shall be your opponent!"

Another warrior had awakened.

![break]

*So what if one more warrior is added?* Zalario originally thought as such. What bothered him more was the delay in hearing from Dino.

*Too slow. Although I've known about Dino's slacking habits for a long time, if we don't get this done soon, there's going to be more and more trouble on my side.*

Zalario's frustration was gradually accumulating as the situation failed to go as planned. Then, a knightly-looking man stepped up in front of Zalario.

"I am reluctant to challenge you with so many people against just one person, but I am not a Paladin anymore. Pragmatism is more important than honor, so please forgive me."

It was Albert who said this. Armed with a set of mythical-grade armor given to him by Rimuru, and having received a 'gift' upon Adalmann's awakening, he had evolved into a 'Gehenna Paladin'. As the official owner of the glorious armor, Albert pointed his sword at Zalario.

"There was still a man like this...?"

Even in Zalario's eyes, Albert's presence was tremendous. His gestures exuded the air of a swordsman, and the mythical-grade blade in his hand had the potential to wound Zalario. He knew at a glance that this was something that could not be ignored.

"I'm here too."

That voice belonged to Wenti, the 'Hell Dragon King' who had awakened from her evolutionary slumber to become a 'Gehenna Dragon.' Now knowing where she learned it from, Wenti bowed gracefully. Zalario's expression turned blank as he realized his disadvantage.

![full page image](image6)

Even in the face of these opponents, it should still be possible to him. But that was not the point. Unless Dino did something about Ramiris, Zalario could not win.

*Even if I were to reveal my true abilities here, it would only be exposing my hand to the enemy. But it's not going to be enough to deal with these guys unless I do so.*

Zalario made his decision. If it was only Charys and Treyni, he could handle them with restraint. However, with the addition of three strong awakened demon lords, even Zalario would have a difficult time. But now, if Zalario did not act as a diversion here, then Feldway's plan would fail. As someone who prided himself on his 100 percent mission success rate, Zalario could not accept such a situation.

*It can't be helped. I'm going to kill them all anyway, so let's show them what I can really do.*

Just as Zalario was about to make up his mind...

"Oh yes, I'll tell you a story that may be of interest to you as well. My realm of protection is the seventieth levels of the labyrinth, so why do you think I ignored the intruders over there?"

"What?"

"I don't want to draw out the answer, so I'll tell you briefly. It's simply because there was no need for me to be there anymore."

"...What are you trying to say?"

Adalmann, a skeleton in the robes of a saint, smiled evilly and laughed. Zalario, uncomfortable with this, asked back.

*Wait a minute... What does he mean? There's no need for him to be there? Does this mean that something happened to Cornu during the invasion?*

Without hearing the answer, Zalario arrived at the truth. However, Adalmann's goal was actually to make Zalario waver, so he told him personally what had happened on the seventieth levels.

"That foolish intruder has been eliminated by Velgrynd-sama. That's why I felt safe to come to you with confidence."

"..."

Zalario was not foolish enough to doubt those words. With Cornu's defeat confirmed, Zalario decided to inquire about the success or failure of the most important objective.

"Huh, I see. With Velgrynd as an opponent, Cornu is no match. There seems to be a lot of odd things going on, but they should still be remedied. So then, you've sent the rest of your meager battle power to me?"

As for why Velgrynd hadn't come him yet, he could only assume that it was because of Masayuki. After all, Masayuki was possibly the inheritor of Rudra's soul, he thought. Feldway, who had examined the information obtained by the Imperial Intelligence Bureau, had ordered Masayuki's extermination in order to eliminate any possibility. However, Velgrynd seemed to have found out about it.

*Cornu is also unlucky. If he hadn't switched roles with me as he had originally planned, none of this would have happened. But I can just ignore Velgrynd. With Michael-sama around, she can easily be controlled. Right now, what's more important...*

What's more important was what Dino was doing.

"So you can afford it. I see, so then you're strong enough to take on Velgrynd-sama. I hate to admit it, but it looks like we've really been underestimated."

"That's true. There's a good chance we'd lose even if we all took on the challenge together."

Charys was wise, but Adalmann also had a quick mind. Both of them realized from Zalario's attitude that he must be hiding incredible abilities. But even so, Adalmann and the others had the advantage. Adalmann explained the reasoning behind this.

"I already know the purpose of your questions. You're really after Ramiris-sama, aren't you? However, we are under orders to ensure the safety of Ramiris-sama at all times and with the highest priority."

Upon awakening from his evolutionary slumber, Adalmann had first confirmed that Ramiris was safe. Naturally, if Ramiris was safe, then everything else would be fine. Above all, it was a supreme order from Rimuru. The main purpose of Adalmann and the other Guardians was to protect the labyrinth. In other words, they were to ensure the safety of Ramiris.

"So, Ramiris-sama is safe, isn't she?"

"Of course, Treyni-dono . Zegion-dono is on his way, so no matter how many people there are, they won't be able to touch Ramiris-sama."

"I see, that's a relief."

Treyni smiled. The others did the same, each with a look of relief on their faces. Now they could focus on Zalario with peace of mind. As for Zalario...

The mere mention of the name Zegion once again gave him the feeling that Dino had failed.

*Zegion was the one who could use Distortion Field, right? But if Dino fights seriously... No, that man can't be expected of much. He was already very reluctant to take part in this mission, so by now he's probably long gone...*

Zalario had a pretty good idea of the current status quo. As if aiming for that moment, a 'Telepathy Net' arrived from Dino.

<Hey, Zalario, I know you can hear me. The mission has failed. Apparently, Cornu screwed up when Velgrynd entered the fray. I've also got a nasty bastard on my end, so I'm retreating now. You should get out of here before the labyrinth closes. See ya!>

It was so one-sided that Zalario couldn't help but laugh bitterly. Zalario thought to himself that this was really in Dino's style, and decided to retreat as well. Since victory at this point was now meaningless, then any unnecessary actions should also be avoided.

"This is the first time I have ever tasted such humiliation---to have to retreat when my opponents are merely a bunch of stragglers who could easily be swept away. There will not be a next time, so remember that."

After blandly uttering his regrets, Zalario took his men with him and teleported away from the labyrinth. Those who remained behind felt no lingering sense of victory, but immersed themselves in the peace of mind that came with having successfully defended the labyrinth.

![soft scene break]

The threat had left the labyrinth. Zegion released his skill 'World of Illusion,' and then looked at Beretta, who had just finished laying Ramiris down on the couch.

"Has Dino-dono escaped?"

"It would seem so."

"Hohoho, you're too modest. It was only the mercy of Ramiris-sama that let him get away."

Beretta was right. Zegion had long noticed that Dino was wearing the Resurrection Bracelet. He had noticed it, and purposely overlooked it. It was an experiment.

---Will Ramiris' blessings be effectively activated even if there is clear hostility towards Ramiris by the equipper?---

The result was as one could see. Dino had won the bet and survived. For Zegion, it could have gone either way. The results of this experiment were obtained only incidentally, and the victory condition had been fulfilled when he defended Ramiris.

"If that is what Ramiris-sama wants, then there is nothing I can do about it."

Beretta nodded back. If they had succeeded in intercepting the enemy, then there was no need to kill uselessly. Of course, there would have been no next time if the enemy had been oblivious to the generous master's mercy. Zegion had intended to pursue Dino depending on his reaction after being resurrected. If there had been no sign of escape, he would have crushed him, but it seemed that that was not necessary. Dino not only chose to escape, but also persuaded his companions to retreat. His two companions accepted this and also withdrew from the area.

"So, what about Zalario?"

"Adalmann-dono rushed over, and there is no sign of the other party anymore. They must have given up and fled as well."

At this point, Adalmann and the others had resurrected and joined the fight, and the remaining enemies seemed to have decided to retreat.

"That's just as well."

"Hmm. If it weren't for Ramiris-sama, we would have been the ones who were defeated, right?"

"Indeed. Even if we had won, there would certainly have been casualties, and for us, that is tantamount to defeat."

"Exactly."

Zegion and Beretta nodded to each other. The thought that it was necessary to revert to a more vigilant posture came to both men at the same time. But that could come later. With that, the labyrinth had been successfully secured. After confirming Ramiris' safety once again, Zegion returned to his domain.
