# Chapter 3: The|Preparations

The location was a small, slightly disorganized conference room. Within stood two suspicious shadows.

No, that's not all. There was also the shadow of a smaller person. It was around thirty centimeters tall and possessed wings similar to those of a dragonfly. With this tiny person's shadow at the center, the other two sat opposite to each other.

![break]

It was Ramiris and her two servants---Beretta and Treyni.

*Doooong!* With an imposing aura, Ramiris struck the mini-table in front of her.

Then, she shared her feelings to her two trusted subordinates.

"This isn't gonna work! We have to move away!"

Maybe she hit it a bit too hard, she rubbed her hand in pain.

While looking at Ramiris gently, Treyni said:

"As expected of Ramiris-sama. What a great idea!"

"Right? Right?"

Ramiris nodded in satisfaction and responded to Treyni with a smile.

The person who spoke up to persuade them is the other person---Beretta.

"One moment please. Putting aside whether or not this is a good idea, where are you planning to move to? And could you share the reason?"

*Why do I have to be that guy*---Beretta thought anxiously.

Speaking of his colleague Treyni, she was kind and attentive, a very capable woman. The spirits also really liked her, all of Ramiris's labyrinth was under her management. These were abilities Beretta did not possess. She was undoubtedly, to Ramiris and himself, a useful talent.

However, there was still a problem with her. That being, Treyni was absolutely spoiling her master, Ramiris. She agreed to Ramiris no matter what she said without even a single shred of doubt. That's why, before things got problematic, someone had to intervene.

*I can't stand it. I didn't follow Ramiris-sama to be that type of character, always the guy to intervene...* Ex-Demon-Clan member Beretta mocked himself.

Beretta really liked Ramiris and he didn't feel any pain even after being toyed around by her. But his colleague that stood together with him not only didn't advise Ramiris, but even blindly spoiled her in her palm, which was hard for him to accept.

Unfortunately...

That was the true nature of this world, the serious people tended to suffer losses.

*This will be bad if it continues---whoever stands up to hit the brake will also be responsible for cleaning up the mess.*

As such, Beretta would be playing the unfavorable role today...

"That is a great question! Isn't it super boring living here, Beretta-chan? There is nothing fun to do unless you count making golems perhaps. There aren't many visitors normally anyway! But there is a lot of fun stuff over there. That's why we should go there and have fun. That's how it is!" Ramiris stressed energetically.

Hearing this, Beretta sighed inwardly, thinking "That's just what I expected."

Beretta had no direct reason to object to Ramiris's suggestion. The only thing was, based on Demon Lord Rimuru's personality, he didn't think the man would easily agree to it. Even if she wanted to move directly to there, it was possible that she would eventually get kicked out. Reasonably speaking, Treyni should've also understood this, but as his colleague, she kept on caving to Ramiris. This forced Beretta to take a stand.

"But Ramiris-sama, hasn't Rimuru-sama already rejected this plan?"

Indeed, she had been rejected once already. That's why without a proper reason, it may displease *him*.

Ramiris may not have been so self-aware, it was, however, a huge problem to Beretta.

"Beretta, you are overcomplicating things. Rimuru-sama is a good and kind-hearted person. If someone as cute as Ramiris-sama makes a request, how could he possibly refuse her so ruthlessly?"

Beretta's useless colleague just liked to make such optimistic claims all day. She was extremely calculating and capable of encountering anything unrelated to Ramiris, yet right now she really couldn't be relied upon. That's why Beretta had to think on behalf of the two airheads to come up with the right plan. After all, Beretta also wished to move closer to Rimuru.

*Because of that, even in such a ridiculous situation, I can still find joy in it...*

Beretta thought to himself. The face hidden behind his mask was smiling cheerfully.

![hard scene break]

After Gobemon departed, I returned to the town of Tempest Federation.

I had been using 'Spatial Domination' to travel, as it could teleport me instantly to anywhere I'd been before. Its magicule consumption was quite large, but it was a negligible portion of my total magicule storage. So it shouldn't pose a problem, and I could use it however many times I wanted, given how convenient it was for traveling. With that being said, it would suck if I entered stasis from overusing it. That's why I put some restraints on its usage.

![break]

By the way, as soon as I returned to town, Ranga contacted me with 'Telepathy Net'.

<Master, Gobkyu and the workers have gathered at West gate, but--->

Ranga paused upon saying this.

*What happened?*

Feeling somewhat uneasy, I walked towards the West gate.

Despite just talking about exercising restraint, I used 'Spatial Domination' to instantly teleport.

Then, I applied 'Universal Perception' to sense the wide area beyond my visual senses to catch on to the location of Ranga. Next, I could easily activate 'Spatial Domination' as long as it was within my visible range. It's a lot like exchanging coordinates.

*It was really convenient, but it should be pretty difficult to use it for combat. The activation requires some time, during which I fear that I would be wide open. It really depends on how you use it, in normal days---Uh, I gotta restrain myself.*

This time it counted as an emergency event. I appeared near Ranga's location.

It was outside the west gate, Gobkyu seemed to be arguing with someone.

---No, I've already used 'Universal Perception' to find out who that was...

![break]

"I've already told you. We are taking over this place!"

Oi oi oi...

I hid off to the side to eavesdrop, and as a result they said something so astonishing.

"Even if you say that, we can't accept it---I'll be reporting to Rimuru-sama right now. Please do not move around by yourself and stay here for a bit."

"No way! We abandoned our previous labyrinth just to visit here! We are poor and homeless now, are you chasing us away?!"

"Even if you say so... Anyhow, this land has been officially included under Rimuru-sama's rule after he became a demon lord. So you have to get Rimuru-sama's permission first---"

"Tsk, it seems that playing the pity card didn't work either. If that's the case, we won't mind resorting to violence. I'll tell you now, my Beretta won't allow you to keep fussing over such trivial stuff..."

![break]

It was no use to keep watching, so I concealed my presence and snuck behind the problematic figure. With a swift motion I effortlessly plucked her out of the air. I looked at her face. It was indeed Ramiris.

"What are you doing here?"

"K-KYAA---! How's life, Rimuru?"

She greeted me while avoiding eye contact. She was clearly aware of the trouble she found herself in. As for what this girl was up to, the secret lay within the small shack behind her. Ramiris declared that she had taken over the place, so there was probably something hiding in it.

By the way, how did she build this shack here---

![break]

"Ramiris-sama! I've brought new wood!"

My question was answered with the sight of Treyni-san running here with wood in her hands.

"What are you doing here, Treyni-san..."

"Ah! I-It's Rimuru-sama, long time no see---"

Treyni-san saw me and started to act dubiously.

*Don't you guys think that your scheme would get exposed immediately after you built a shack right outside the town's gate?*

"What is going on here, Treyni-san?"

"A-About that, you must be misunderstanding. I-It's not Ramiris-sama's fault, it's..."

Treyni-san always looked very professional in the past, but ever since she began to serve Ramiris she had started becoming inept. Sure enough, a servant would be influenced by their master... Speaking of which, the only person who could explain this clearly was probably him---Beretta---who immediately kneeled upon seeing me.

"Come and explain things a bit, Beretta."

"Ah, so I have to do it after all..."

At my urging, Beretta gave up his struggle and began to explain. According to him, all of this started because of a speech given by Ramiris.

"B-Beretta! You traitor---!" Ramiris escaped from my hand and shouted, but I ignored her to listen to his story.

He said Ramiris wanted to move to our town no matter what, to which Treyni-san also agreed. I glanced towards Treyni-san's direction and saw that her eyes were downcast in embarrassment.

Based on Beretta's explanation, Treyni-san was apparently spoiling Ramiris. This rings true given it was the same when they met before. And since that Beretta couldn't object to the both of them, he was forced into this whole charade of forced house moving.

"But in fact it is just as Ramiris-sama has said, we've sealed the entry to the previous labyrinth and moved here."

"That's right! So Rimuru. If you chase me from here, I'll be homeless!" Ramiris said pitifully, but no matter how you put it she clearly had it coming. Also, Treyni-san was saying: "How poor Ramiris-sama is."

*Please stop spoiling the fairy.* But then again, now I understood the situation. Gobkyu didn't start the quarrel. The fault was in Ramiris's party.

"Gobkyu, thanks for being so patient."

"There's no need, we are fine. It did give the men guarding the gate some trouble though..."

Gobkyu turned to the ogre gatekeeper who happened to be napping.

"---Oi."

"T-There's no such thing. I was just a bit too excited..."

"It is not Ramiris-sama's fault! It was all because that gatekeeper said something mean to Ramiris-sama, so I used magic to put him to sleep for a bit."

Treyni-san jumped in to defend Ramiris. What kind of farce was she playing... It seemed that she indeed used magic, apparently for Ramiris. Even Beretta seemed dumbfounded. I would listen to Ramiris and Treyni-san later. For now I needed Beretta to continue his explanation. However, he apparently already finished explaining the entire situation. He mentioned that Treyni-san was preparing wood while Beretta was doing the assembling.

![exact fit image](image5)

The end product was the small wooden shack in front of me. It looked like they were planning to build a balcony next. Why build a shack? Apparently, it was for creating the new entrance to the labyrinth...

Speaking of this, Ramiris had mentioned something about wanting to move to this town. If all they were doing was setting up an entrance to Ramiris's labyrinth, putting such a small shack here didn't seem to pose a problem.

"So, you were trying to build the shack when the gatekeeper stopped you. And after you he interfered, you ordered Treyni-san to put him to sleep. And in the end, you were discovered by Gobkyu and the other workers who came here, is that the case?"

"That...no, there's no...such thing... I guess you can put it that way, but it's not really the case...probably the case?"

"In other words, my guess was correct? Gees..."

"Aha, Ahahaha..."

Ramiris tried to laugh it off, but this was simply too reckless. This was my domain after all, even the other demon lords had recognized it. What Ramiris was doing undoubtedly infringed on my territory. Normally, it wouldn't be strange if an incident like this developed into open war.

But right now I had an idea. Seeing the small shack in front of me, I had a sudden burst of inspiration.

After doing a bit of outside the box thinking, it wouldn't be so bad to let her create the labyrinth here. My conversation with Myourmiles from a few minutes ago echoed in my head. We needed to find a main event that would have people wanting to come back and see our nation again. That's why we planned the opera house, the colosseum, and the health resort. But I was also been thinking about whether there could be other attractions. After all, doing the same thing all the time will eventually get stale.

Besides, martial tournaments couldn't be held every day. At most we could hold four events in a year, considering it would be most appropriate to hold once per season. The same logic applied to horse racing. Content for ordinary folk to watch could be played every day, but these shows alone wouldn't be able to attract the nobles who had grown a hard-to-satisfy appetite.

Considering this, our main customers would be average civilians and foreign adventurers. This town was designed with logistical flow in mind, so merchants would definitely be visiting, the adventurers acting as their guards in tow, so I hoped they would consider this as a base.

An adventurer had many jobs to do, one of them being eliminating monsters. If I were to create a labyrinth here and fill it with monsters... In this way, wouldn't we be drawing a massive crowd every day?

Speaking of labyrinths, there was none that could top a dungeon. If we invited people to try and conquer the labyrinth, there may even be adventurers visiting for the sole purpose of exploration.

*Yes, this may actually work.*

I turned to Ramiris who was looking up at me with an awkward smile. She was kinda... No, very unreliable, but this may just work. I'd made up my mind and decided to discuss my idea with Ramiris.

![soft scene break]

I asked Gobkyu to direct the workers to dismantle the shack. But since the work was already in progress, we decided to change this place to a resting shack for the gatekeeper.

Next, we held a strategic meeting. With Gobkyu in tow, we went to the meeting room that was often used.

"Q-question please? How do you^[Ramiris is talking like a girl of low status from Japanese historical drama confronting some government official prosecuting her.] plan to deal with the adorable folk girl and her companions?"

Probably due to being too nervous, Ramiris's phrasing had become weird. It was probably because of her crisis senses. She kept on peeking at me.

"You don't have to force yourself to act so courteously. Besides, not all of your words were as humble as you think, even the way you addressed yourself sounded weird."

That's why I hoped she could just use her normal tone to talk. I didn't intend to do anything to Ramiris anyway. If she accepted my proposal, I was willing to overlook the whole charade put on by her. But before that, I needed to confirm a few things.

"Gobkyu, I want to create an evacuation space under the colosseum, is it possible?"

"Even calculating based on the strength of an individual executive, the area under the stage is still not very safe. Once any hole is made, it may cause the entire stage to collapse. But it would be possible by shifting the position a little bit---"

"I see. I also wish to build a gate in that basement area."

"...!"

"Building a gate?"

"Yes. Please make it thick and pave some stones to the walls to make it feel solid enough."

"Will we be preparing evacuation space behind the gate too?"

"No, there's no such need. The important thing is just the gate, right, Ramiris?"

"R-Rimuru? Could it be, that you want to..."

Gobkyu looked confused while Ramiris on the other hand was filled with joy as she flapped her wings loudly.

I finally cracked a smile and nodded to Ramiris.

Speaking of my proposal, it's really nothing. I just wanted Ramiris to use her power to create and run a dungeon. Rather than building the entrance in some shack, we should prepare something more fitting and majestic. Since we'd defined it as basement level, it shouldn't be a problem to build a colosseum on top of it.

The colosseum could provide amateur adventurers with lessons and instructions, and stores to sell healing potions were also expected to be set up. If we ran a dungeon like that, adventurers who were done with their business might grab a drink on their way home, so those stores and restaurants would also prosper along the way. Then I'd be able to grab money from the adventurers, and Ramiris would also have a place to live, not to mention a job. I would even give her pocket money. This idea required mutual cooperation, but it might just turn into something interesting.

Ramiris began to shout excitedly after hearing my words.

"Eh-EHEH! Could you be saying that you are giving me some amazing job on top of allowing us to create the labyrinth and live here?"

"If you accept my proposal, that would indeed be the case."

"Eh? Then, then, do you mean that I have a chance to overcome this unbearable state of being a NEET---?"

She seemed downright shocked after hearing my plan. Ramiris's eyes widened as if she'd been hit by lightning, even the way she spoke began to sound incoherent.

Treyni-san saw this with tears in her eyes and said: "This is wonderful, Ramiris-sama." For some reason, I felt a smile on Beretta's face. The exhausted look he gave before appeared to be an act, now he looked positively delighted.

Could it be that Beretta had hoped things would develop this way too?

It could be, or not. In any case, it's fine as long as he was happy.

"Q-Question... Did you mean it when you said that you will give me pocket money?"

She seemed to have calmed down. Ramiris gulped and asked me prudently. She appeared to be afraid that I would respond with "Never mind that".

*How would I say something like that, I'm not that mean, really! But depending on the amount of income, I can't really promise you how much you are getting though... But that would at least reassure her a little bit.*

"That's real. The only thing is we won't know how much profit we are getting until we try. Regardless, subtracting the necessary expenses such as promotional fees and venue rent, you get to keep two percent of remaining profits, what do you think?"

"B-Based on that, how much money would that be?"

"About that, if we assume a thousand or so adventurers visiting a day, your portion would be around two gold coins?"

"GUU! I-I get to earn that much money?!"

"Those are just estimates, whether it can be carried out successfully is still unknown. After all, there's not much of a show to put on if there is no audience. That being said, since you are already settling in here, isn't there no loss to you regardless?"

Ramiris nodded heavily in response to my question.

She came to live here without permission, and I knew, without her saying, that I'd be the one maintaining the labyrinth. If that is the case, she'd be better off just accepting my deal. After hearing my permission for her to live and make money, Ramiris had only one reaction, that was to hug onto my head and shout excitedly.

Since Ramiris had already accepted it, Beretta and Treyni-san naturally would not object.

"Uhehe... Now I will become rich as well. Never again will I be looked down upon and get called the Jobless Broke Demon Lord!"

As such, Ramiris had been mesmerized in her own world. I couldn't help but laugh at her state.

All right, that should do it.

Even upon seeing the silly^[A general Japanese term for: "Sorry-looking" (残念) one that makes people cringe] looks on Ramiris, the loyalty of her two servants remained unchanged. She may have always been looked down upon, but Ramiris's motivation and enthusiasm were really something else. The level of enthusiasm she had displayed for the project probably exceeded my own. It seemed that I didn't have to worry about her.

![break]

By the way, what's with Ramiris's obsession with money?

Putting myself aside, I hadn't heard of any demon lord that loved money this much... Compared to having money or not, shouldn't the bigger problem be whether or not she had a job?

*That's right, not a single soul had been visiting Ramiris's labyrinth. Perhaps she was too idle and lonely. For Ramiris's and my own sake, I hope there will be adventurers visiting. In order to achieve that, let's quickly come up with a plan to make that happen.*

After calling back Ramiris, whose mind had taken a trip, we began to draft the design graph for the colosseum construction.

My plans were as follows:

Outside the west gate, there was a plaza at the end of the road. We'd expand the plaza first, then start the construction. Since there was plenty of space, we could also open up a stable for the travelers to rest their horses in. In the future we would be adding tracks on the streets for trains to run on. I recalled planning for trains in hopes that royalty would ride on them. If we could ensure the safety of travel routes, it would be easy to attract wealthy tourists. That, of course, would not be the only purpose of trains. With them we would be able to transport large amounts of cargo. This infrastructure would likely also contribute significantly to the city's development.

Since part of this plan was a scheme with the hope of developing the city, I hoped for it to work out well without complications. We might even set up a station near the colosseum... It would become a burden for the tourists if the distance were too far, so the standard would be within an hour's walk from the gate. Having a location near the town would be better. Because the tourists would be walking, we would get customers at the inns along the route. Unlike my original world, people mostly relied on their legs to travel in this world. Most people could easily walk back and forth for tens of kilometers. So it shouldn't be an issue to have some distance between buildings.

Keeping these factors in mind, I considered the location for construction---

"Why? Isn't there any empty lot in the town as well?" Ramiris pointed out and corrected me.

"Those are used as shelters for the beastmen. The temporary residences set there would pose trouble for building a colosseum."

"Can't we just chase the beastmen out of town for now and construct at this place until Geld-sama finishes building their new cities---"

As I began to explain to Gobkyu, Ramiris suddenly proposed something unexpected.

"If that's the case, why not have them move into my labyrinth? You can move the area entirely into it without change and it won't cause much trouble."

Did you catch the drift? Gobkyu and I looked at each other over and over.

"D-Do you mean that, you can move the people inside there along with the buildings?"

"Well---it's probably useless for living people. It requires personal permission before moving them into the labyrinth. If the objects do not possess the personal will of the owner, it won't be moved, otherwise anything can be moved!"

"Are you serious? Are you implying that except the beastmen, you can move everything including the residences and personal belongings all into the labyrinth?"

"Yep, that's the case!" Ramiris said proudly, but it was indeed impressive.

There's no wonder she seemed so proud; this was an incredible skill.

After more careful inquiry, Ramiris revealed that this was her Intrinsic Skill, named 'Labyrinth Creation (Mini World)'^[The katakana annotation is "チイサナセカイ" or "小さな世界" (Small world)].

As the name implied, it allowed Ramiris to create the interior of the labyrinth. She was nigh omnipotent in that regard. The area affected by its power was also extensive, it is said that even the people and objects near the labyrinth could become its target.

For instance, if someone was directly outside the labyrinth, she seemed to be able to deprive the individual of weapons and gear.

This skill may seem to be overpowered, but it did appear to have its limits. For example, if the person's equipment possessed personal will---or was affected by the user's mana etc., it will not be affected by Ramiris's power. However, people who possessed such items were rare, so most would end up challenging Ramiris with only their bare hands.

She was a demon lord after all, that title was not just for show---

"How impressive... And I thought that you didn't possess any combat ability..."

"T-That's so mean! How dare you say such things to me, the menace to man and the strongest demon lord..."

"Ah, okie, don't get mad now, Ramiris-chan. Let's put that aside for now and tell me what else can you do!"

I started to ask some specific questions regarding 'Labyrinth Creation'.

![break]

These questions roughly fell under five categories:

- ?[label](I.) How many floors can 'Labyrinth Creation' make underground?

- ?[label](II.) How many days will it take to create them?

- ?[label](III.) What will happen to the monsters inside?

- ?[label](IV.) Can you change the interior structure randomly?

- ?[label](V.) What happens when you die inside?

Stuff like that.

![break]

Ramiris also switched to a serious expression and answered all my doubts.

First,

There didn't seem to be any restriction to the number of floors it could construct, but in reality, it could only reach around a hundred floors or so.

![break]

Second,

It took around one hour to create a single floor. The same went for additional floors, so it would take around one hundred hours to spawn one hundred floors. However, the energy consumption creating deeper floors seemed to increase exponentially, which appeared to be the reason behind the answer to the first question.

![break]

Third,

Not only monsters, even creatures such as insects could inhabit the labyrinth. I heard that there used to be spirits inhabiting the labyrinth before. That location had not yet disappeared but was stored in another level to isolate it from the outside world. It was also said that they were free to come in and out. If that's the case, we would be able to fill the labyrinth with monsters for adventurers to challenge.

Moreover, if you filled it with an abundance of magicule, monsters would be born naturally. By adjusting the magicule concentration, you could also conveniently predetermine the strength of the monsters. Monsters on different floors could be banned from interacting, so setting up difficulty levels seemed to not be a problem either.

And the most important point was---we'd come up with a way of filling the labyrinth with magicule. We would be doing that after we had prepared the contents for the labyrinth.

![break]

Fourth,

Ramiris's Intrinsic Skill 'Labyrinth Creation' had extraordinary efficiency, its interior structure could be changed in around an hour. After one change, it would remain fixed for twenty-four hours. That came, of course, with additional conditions. You couldn't make something out of nothing. It seemed that there was no way to generate organism such as vegetation, so we could only rely on creating inorganic walls to make the labyrinth... But it was not actually changing the whole structure, only the interior design of it that we'd prepared, this way it wouldn't cost too much time. By the way, it was also very simple to swap floors. The previously stated rules applied, meaning every twenty-four hours only one change was permitted, but it was still very convenient.

![break]

Fifth,

This was honestly surprising, but what happened when you died inside could be altered by Ramiris's will. Provided she was aware of the situation, Ramiris could even resurrect the dead. I was still contemplating what to do about the disposal of monsters' corpses and such and how to deal with the unfortunate deaths some adventurers might suffer. Well, as it turned out I heard something very unexpected.

We didn't have any examples of monsters born in the labyrinth to judge yet. However, Ramiris mentioned that she had resurrected adventurers several times before.

The secret behind this was related to the "Permission of the target", as mentioned by Ramiris before. It wasn't an exaggeration but apparently the will of "I would like to go in" was crucial. It was a pre-condition, without which entering the labyrinth was impossible. It was the same reason why I was able to enter the labyrinth before. If you tried to bring someone asleep inside, you would be blocked at the entrance.

Infants were exceptions. Children of young age have yet to form free will, so they appeared to be considered as goods and would gain protection. It was not impossible to force someone into entering the labyrinth, but this would also create a lot of pressure on Ramiris, such an action might fail due to the repulsive effect. So she wasn't willing to spend time doing such a boring thing.

That's about it, the prelude stops here.

![break]

Ramiris had the ability to rule over the people who entered the labyrinth. With that being said however, it still required the person's consent. If they were willing to accept Ramiris's management, she would be able to keep track of their status at any instant.

"That's right, didn't we really enjoy pranks? We just wanted to have fun watching how shocked people looked, but my conscience won't sit well if they had actually died. That's why we always knew when to stop and allowed people to return alive," Ramiris proclaimed with her chest high.

There were people who were unlucky and died, but that probably happened outside of the labyrinth. After all, Ramiris had no intention of killing me either back then.

And there was also the Elemental Colossus that tried to kill me, did they put that thing there knowing that people could be resurrected? I had wanted to ask, "What type of trial is this", but now it made more sense.

"In other words, even if adventurers enter the labyrinth to eliminate monsters they won't get killed and can be revived?"

"Yes. As soon as they are thrown out of the labyrinth they will appear as if nothing had happened when they are resurrected from death. But it would be problematic when the number becomes too large, so it should be best to have them wear the items I've prepared for resurrection."

With the identification items crafted by Ramiris using 'Labyrinth Creation', people could be revived outside the labyrinth if they died. And so, the most worrying problem of safety had been resolved.

"Excellent! This is wonderful, Ramiris-chan!"

"Really, really, really? Am I not impressive indeed?"

"Hmm! Now our ambition is as good as accomplished."

"Is that the case? I think so too!"

We looked at each other and nodded.

"Thanks for the help, Ramiris."

"No problem, just count on me. Now you can rest assured like you've boarded a huge ship."

A huge ship you said. I hope it's not made of mud.~~(Or called the Titanic)~~

Due to the difference in our size, we couldn't really shake hands, but we communicated with our hearts.

![soft scene break]

I had accepted Ramiris's proposal, and I was now heading to the empty lot located at the southeast side of town to build the colosseum. We would be building the dungeon under that spot.

As for the opera house, we would be building it at the northwest side where many classy health resorts stood. There were also a stadium, museum and other buildings constructed in the hotel area that we built beforehand in case they came to be useful in the future, so we decided to build one more to catch up with the festival.

With the plans for the dungeon and the opera house finalized, the problem was with the colosseum.

Geld was absent, but Gobkyu and his men were quite capable too. Before the unveiling of the Founding Festival, it could definitely be---

"---The situation is exceptionally dire, Rimuru-sama."

*Ah, so was the schedule really that tight after all?*

But that was probably only natural. Normally speaking such construction projects took years to complete, it was really asking too much from them to complete it in a month plus a handful of days. No matter how powerful monsters were, it was indeed still a dire spot.

"Saw that coming... I understand, I'll help as well. I'll handle transportation of soil and processing steel."

![break]

Despite how I may look now, I had worked at a general contractor company before I was reincarnated. Even though I was not that skillful in field work, having some knowledge of the discipline was better than having none. Moreover, I had Wisdom King Raphael-sensei with me as well, so I should be able to figure out something.

"I wanna too! I'm gonna help too!"

"Then, I should also assist as well."

"Indeed. We follow the will of Ramiris-sama."

Since Ramiris and her servants also agreed to help, let's get to work soon. We arrived at the construction site full of camps and laid out the blueprint. I quickly modified it and handed it over to Gobkyu.

"I see. Then there shouldn't be a problem anymore."

"Great, I still have to let the beastmen know what we intend."

First, we were going to host a meeting to explain things. Right now many beastmen were out at work, so I decided to explain the situation to Suphia and Alvis.

"If that's the case, we will follow the will of Rimuru-sama---"

"Right. We don't have a reason to object anyway."

After hearing my explanation, the two agreed without hesitation. It was shocking how fast they agreed to it. They also told me to not to do any further explanation for the beastmen.

"Eh, is that really okay?"

"No problem, Rimuru-sama. We are in your care with residence and diet. We should be the ones to repay your debts, so allow us to help with the construction of the colosseum."

"Besides, Karion-sama is also participating in the festival that Rimuru-sama is holding. So we have to help regardless."

After saying so, Suphia and Alvis agreed to assist us.

"I don't really feel well, so I'll hand the matter to Suphia."

"Right, just count on me!"

After discussing with them, we decided to have Suphia lead the beastmen. Afterwards, things progressed rapidly, and everything was on point. The process was so swift it was almost shocking. With Suphia's orders, the beastmen all exited the tents. Glancing through the lined up beastmen, we had Ramiris move the tents into her labyrinth. In the next instant, the location had been cleared. While feeling somewhat hesitant, I activated 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' and bit out a square-shaped pit in the ground to set up the steel structure.

With Gobkyu and the rest lining up and paving the processed rock materials to fill in the walls, we were unexpectedly able to construct a flawless, beautiful product in only a day. And as such, this massive underground space was created with a huge gate set at its entrance. Given my advanced knowledge, the speed of completion had been quick beyond belief.

"A-Amazing. We are getting this as my castle... Ah, right! I set it up so touching the door here will teleport you to the floor with all those tents just now."

Since Ramiris had said so, we immediately went in to have a look.

The scene stretched out before us, the living space of the beastmen had indeed been moved here in one piece. There was even air-conditioning which made living inside more comfortable than living in the wild. Even Alvis and Suphia looked surprised.

"Do we still need to set up tents inside here?"

"Indeed. There doesn't even seem to be any rain, so it shouldn't be an issue if we just directly sleep on the ground..."

This was their conversation. There didn't seem to be any complaint, so there shouldn't be any issue. The beastmen appeared shocked as they went in and out several times. As long as the thought "I want to go in" was present you could enter it, so there didn't seem to be any inconvenience.

"Will it get dark at night in there?"

"Hmm! Since it is connected to the outside, I can even make it rain!"

*There's really nothing that will pose an obstacle to her.*

Since they were not conducting any agricultural work, I asked Ramiris to only simulate the day-night cycle. It felt more convenient than I imagined as it could be applied in other fields. It prompted me to consider all sorts of possible plans.

![break]

The beastmen at the scene seemed to be reassured and went on to assist the work outdoors. They were apparently under Gobkyu's command to help constructing the colosseum. Although the majority of them were women and children, they were still beastmen with strength far outclassing humans. They were an impeccable workforce and Gobkyu was also willing to only hand simple tasks to them. The beastmen who were previously receiving technical training had also returned to join in the construction.

Treyni-san had carried some lumber here of unknown origin with Beretta correctly processing them into boards for construction use. He was able to greatly shorten the time normally required for this by using magic to dry the wood.

I was under the impression that I had already thrown away things such as common sense, but upon laying my eyes on this sight, I couldn't help but realize, yet again, "Ah, this is an isekai all right".

If we proceeded at this rate, we might actually finish by the Founding Festival. The soil I just ate and spat out was piled up as a small mountain, surely they would make good use of it as well to construct a majestic colosseum.

![break]

"Rimuru-sama, leave the rest to me!"

![break]

I nodded after hearing Gobkyu's words and decided to let him do his thing until the project was completed.

When everyone officially started to work, Ramiris was left alone. In order to prevent the impetuous Ramiris from hindering everyone, I should give her a job. And if there was any job Ramiris could work on, it would be expanding the labyrinth. Given this opportunity, we should be a bit more thorough.

Speaking of which---

"Ramiris, your 'Labyrinth Creation' is really strong..."

It was a large area of land being moved into the labyrinth in the blink of an eye. Although I didn't really want to praise Ramiris, this one thing left me deeply impressed. Honestly, I think this thing called labyrinth is really awesome...

"It's all right, just all right! Right now there are only some secret rooms for my fairy friends, the level with corridors. There will be new floors added tomorrow!"

I recalled she said that it was an hour per floor. If we were building a hundred-level labyrinth underground, it may be an insurmountable challenge with modern technology alone.

But Ramiris's power could make it reality. And given that was the case, a man should pursue romance (epic fantasy)^[浪漫を求めるのが男というもの, Romance also means an epic, heroic adventure. ~~Anyone remember the Dragonball closing theme "I'll Give You Romance"?~~].

"All right then, I'm counting on you to build the maximum one-hundred floors."

"Eh! Do we really need that many?"

"Yes. I want to add in all sorts of contraptions and change the strength of the monsters based on floors."

"It's a piece of cake for me, but can I ask about something?"

"What is it?"

"I've been curious just now, what exactly do you plan to do in spawning the monsters? Where are you capturing them from?" Ramiris asked me.

It did seem quite exhausting to increase the floors to one hundred, it's no wonder she would question me. But I had my own plan in mind. In order to convince Ramiris, I let her in a little about my scheme.

"It's actually like this, but you'll have to keep it a secret..."

With this magic word, I began my explanation to Ramiris covertly.

As I explained my plans for her dungeon, Ramiris's eyes became brighter and brighter.

"Oh, so you mean, you mean---"

"Hmmhmm---next we will be doing this, Ramiris-chan---"

We whispered to each other and raised ideas. Both of us were enjoying this.

We had a pleasant chat---and were rushing towards a direction that, ideally, we should avoid; the unexpected idea of an advanced dungeon was gradually formed.

*Is this really okay*? Although this though crossed my mind, there was no going back on the matter. *All we can do is make it.* Ramiris was also full of motivation and promised me she would devote herself to making the labyrinth.

"You can slack a bit while doing it."

"Hmph! Now that I've heard such amazing ideas, how will I be able to sit back and relax! I'm doing it. I'm doing it!"

I intend to spark up Ramiris's motivation a little bit, so I spoke about it to encourage her, yet I didn't expect to light up her spirit completely. I was happy that Ramiris could understand that sense of romance; that such a bold idea may have a chance to be realized was what I was looking forward to at the moment.

"Then please work hard. I'll do my best to collect the necessary resources."

"I understand. Good luck, Rimuru!"

"Right, the same goes for you, Ramiris."

We exchanged these words of encouragement, as a satisfied smile hung on both of our faces.

![soft scene break]

I left after the conversation. The sun had already begun to set. We seemed to have chatted for a long time. The work today was concluded, and people started to pack up and cook food.

It would be embarrassing to be a hindrance to them, so I told Gobkyu, Suphia, and the rest to return tomorrow and then left the construction site shortly after.

![break]

I decided to drop by Kurobee's workplace.

He'd been working on experimental weapons and gear out of interest. My visit this time was to ask him whether he could give me the products that couldn't be sold as merchandise.

Right now, the southwest area of the town had become the industrial area. Kurobee's workshop was also over there, with the workshops of his disciples surrounding it as well as dorms for the apprentices who didn't have their own shop. All these in addition to a large number of warehouses. Moreover, there were also inns and canteens set up specially for the craftsmen and apprentices, everything looked very prosperous. Kurobee's workshop was built at the central area.

Seeing that I was visiting, Kurobee came out to welcome me delightfully. After greeting and sharing a dinner with me, I asked him to bring me to the warehouses.

"Rimuru-sama, this way. The items stored at this warehouse are all very distinct, they can't be wielded by any random person. Is that really okay?" Kurobee asked worriedly, to which I nodded in response implying that it was fine. Just as Kurobee had said, some of these items were simply too strong for average men to use. Some of the items that he kept in the warehouse were too overpowered, others were too difficult or dangerous to use.

Some of the armor pieces were good examples to illustrate this point: For instance, there was armor that absorbed the wearer's mana in order to activate a magic defense barrier. It sounded pretty impressive, but in reality, it would draw mana without a limit, so after some time the armor would kill its user. Even though it was amazing that it provided a defensive barrier, such gear had no use in practice.

There were others, such as a sword that absorbed the surrounding magicule until no magic could be cast nearby and then converted it into a huge blast. The strength of the sword was guaranteed, but as for the safety of the user...quite the opposite. These types of weapons were terrifying and mustn't be used under any circumstances.

There was also armor that gifted the wearer with extraordinary physical capabilities for a fixed period of time. But as soon as that time was exceeded, all of the user's muscle tissue would be torn rendering him immobile, leading to death without healing magic. A savage armor indeed...

![break]

In short, there was equipment that caused the wearer to die an untimely death. I believed there wasn't anyone stupid enough to use them without first appraising their properties. That part I didn't find necessary for myself to handle, regardless of that, it should be fine in Ramiris's labyrinth.

"No, it's all right. Having those very obvious properties may actually prove to be valuable."

In fact, all of this equipment was of very fine quality. Half of them were of value above rare-grade, and among them were also precious items that appeared to be strong enough to rival unique-grade equipment. They were the same type of equipment as the scaled shield and tempest dagger.

I picked one of them up---a tempest longsword---and said to Kurobee while examining it: "Equipment of such amazing quality, just because they are experimental shouldn't make us just store it here without using them. Surely this gear would also want masters who can wield them, right?"

I made sure to be extra edgy, making things sound extra *deep*, which Kurobee was deeply moved by upon hearing.

"Is that so? Then please take as many as you like."

This was (definitely) not lying to him, though I felt my heart hurt a bit.

Kurobee took out many pieces of equipment from the warehouses. As for why I was taking them, it was to put them into the treasure chests in the labyrinth. The adventurers would get the equipment at the level corresponding to the strength of the gear. That's why I was definitely not lying. I shouldn't mind that much and take them happily.

By the way, they sure were capable of making so many of these. There were a lot more now than last time with more than a hundred items. Not only was there bizarre equipment, there were also items challenging to use. If this assortment of items had anything in common, it's that they were all of higher class compared to the merchandise I saw at the capital of Ingracia. I felt that all of these weapons and gear could only be seen in an auction.

After my evolution to demon lord, Kurobee was also blessed with the Unique Skill 'Godly Craftsman'. Apart from his original Unique Skill 'Researcher', he had gained newfound ability to further his craftsmanship. Now he had even surpassed Kaijin. If Kurobee was serious with his production, the quality of his work would often be unique-grade. They were at least guaranteed to be rare-grade. That's why they were only showing the work of his disciples at the exhibition.

"By the way, you are really good. I learned about blacksmithing before, yet I can't make such impressive items."

"Hehe, it's quite embarrassing to be praised by Rimuru-sama. Oh, I should give this to you before I forget."

Kurobee was very humble, yet his expression suddenly froze as he ran into the further part of the room and returned while carrying something.

"What is this?"

"Sir^[Kurobee responds to Rimuru's comments and questions with a "はい" in the beginning of the sentence, which is like "Yes sir/To answer your question". Same for the next line.], I've kept you waiting for too long, it is finally complete," Kurobee said while handing me the thing, it was a straight sword (chokuto) with a dark blade.

Not too long and not too short. The sword was made just for me with an ideal length beautifully crafted.

"This is---"

"Yes, this is my finest masterpiece."

The blade appeared to be jet black and wholly unremarkable. It wasn't emitting any incredible power nor was it triggered using magic.

But this would suffice. The focus of the sword was its strength. It would not break easily or be bent and fit very well with my mana. Moreover, unlike Hinata's Moonlight Rapier, it would not harm things in its surroundings.

Based on these considerations for a weapon that wouldn't cause me any concern, it was the best.

"Amazing, this is amazing, Kurobee-san."

"I'm also highly satisfied with the product. The sword is not completed the way it is right now. As I've explained to your before, the ideas proposed by Rimuru-sama, slots can be drilled in the base of the blade."

Upon hearing so, I looked at the base of said blade.

"But there aren't any slots here?"

"No. Other weapons will have slots drilled upon being crafted. But this straight sword is different. After being immersed in Rimuru-sama's mana, it will grow---evolve. And it will look the same as now, like an average weapon," Kurobee elaborated proudly.

I heard that afterwards the quality of the sword was to surpass Legendary-grade... I wasn't sensing it in person just yet. As of this moment, we were still researching with other equipment and the crucial magic crystals for enchanting the slots had yet to be completed. Drilling slots alone would be meaningless, so it was no use for me to be anxious about it. I decided to wait and look forward to the arrival of that day.

![break]

Having received my own special sword, I departed from Kurobee's workshop happily. Additionally, I had the equipment I came for in tow. I'd put these items in the treasure chests and deploy them in the labyrinth. The equipment with higher quality would be guarded by the floor guardians (boss of each level), it would be pretty interesting. This almost felt like crafting a real dungeon labyrinth, how exciting.

Indeed, these experimental or even failed works could still earn quite a lot of money from being auctioned off directly. If I asked Myourmiles and Fuze for help, they would probably secure a tidy profit in their own way. It would be more pragmatic, but we shouldn't do it. The important thing here was the exchange between monsters and humans.

I wanted to attract people to visit my kingdom and let them experience the beauty of Tempest Federation. In addition, I wanted them to feel the charm of this nation in person so that they would return again. We should consider the equipment as a small cost to reach that goal.

Besides, things were not over after I delivered the items. I already had outlines for the future. The adventurers would infiltrate the dungeon to bring back all sorts of items. Given it was extremely dangerous to use un-appraised weapons or gear, it was time for the "Appraisal Shop" to shine. Since all these items were crafted in our nation, we would also have complete knowledge of their effects. As long as the method of using them was not mistaken, many of these items could be useful in their adventures. There were some dangerous items included as I've mentioned, but I thought it would be fine if our nation bought those items back.

Money needed to flow in order to have value, it was meaningless to only fill our own wallet. First, it was imperative to buy back necessary ingredients, and then pay the expenses to some extent, the rest we could even give back to the adventurers. After some time, adventurers would naturally begin to spread the news and so the reputation of our nation would increase. All of this hinged upon our ability to retain a steady stream of customers to make good use of the buildings we constructed, not to mention the amazing promotional impact it was going to have. We should strive to make our investments count.

The southeast area would have the colosseum built with Ramiris's dungeon beneath it. There were also inns and civilian houses charging a fair price on the southwest side. Unlike the northeastern block with many classy hotels, the facilities there would be more down to earth. This place would primarily appeal to adventurers, with the added benefit of keeping different classes separate. It was also most convenient to visit the labyrinth from there, so business would definitely be booming.

When Ramiris said that she wanted to move here, I was still worried about what to do. In terms of results, I suppose I had made the right call.

As far as the Colosseum was concerned, we would be hosting one or two major events every year. Beyond that, we would organize all kinds of events on normal days as well. Military training or events for adventurers to test their skills, to name a few. There were actually plenty of activities if I thought about it carefully. Underneath in the dungeon, we could also run field experiments and examine the results. Since we couldn't die while inside, we might even do some dangerously excessive and over-the-top training.

Perhaps it could be for more than just commercial usage, there were plenty of areas it could be applied---concerning these ideas, I decided to discuss things with Benimaru.

![soft scene break]

So we had our "bait".

But right now it was too early to decide exactly how the dungeon would be used. I want to ponder on it after it was complete. In order to complete the final step, I decided to negotiate with a key figure.

![break]

The key figure of this plan---Veldora-san.

He was currently resting in the garden hut at my estate. The lone estate was like a tearoom with the Japanese style of quiet beauty. In fact, this place had a secret---uh, I'll put that aside for now. Let's just say that Veldora has become used to staying there and considers it his home.

Whatever really...

![break]

"Hey, Veldora. I've got a request for you, is it okay?"

"Uh? What is it, I'm pretty busy."

*Hmm, I see that you are reading manga, so yeah, there's no way you're not free*.

"Is that so...what a pity then. That's a waste of such an interesting thing... But since you're busy then it can't be helped. It's such a rare chance for you to release your---oh, you are busy. Sorry that I bothered you."

Saying this, I pretended to leave. Although this was basically me leaving my own room, which made me feel kind of bad, there was plenty of places to spend the night. And even with that being said---

"Umm, hol' up. I'm a busy man indeed, but since it is you who came asking, it can't be helped. Tell me about it!"

*So did he really bite?*

*Gullible as always.*

Veldora-san had the nickname of "Gullidora"^[This is actually グエルドラ, Gueredora, but basically, it's just a pun name to say Veldora is very gullible. (Gullible Veldora)]. I'd known for a while that he was easily tricked. To me, outsmarting this guy was like twisting the hands of an infant. And given this was the case, what came next was much easier. I pretended to be deep while phrasing things very intriguingly.

"The thing is, I plan to design a home just for you..."

"W-What are you talking about? Building a place just for me, is this true?"

He had taken the bait. His eyes left the manga, and he began to pay attention to my words intently.

"That's right! built just for you. But if you are so busy---"

"Wait, don't be so hasty. You and I go way back after all, so of course I'll prioritize your request, GA-HAHAHA!" Veldora-san said that so arrogantly.

But this was good.

Seeing that he was waiting for me to continue, I might just tell him now.

Veldora often didn't listen and I was forced into tricking him. Troublesome as it was, it remained the necessary ritual to draw his attention.

"So...some people need to make friends."

"Hmmhmm, just speak your mind with the request!"

"The thing is, Ramiris is moving to town. We are building that girl's labyrinth right under the colosseum and then---"

While he was still interested to hear me out, I told him about Ramiris moving in. Veldora understood faster than I expected.

"Oh, is it Ramiris? I'm not entirely sure about that girl's ability, but I think she has the power to create tunnels that will lead to the same location no matter which entrance on the surface is taken. Is she able to create a labyrinth with complex layouts?"

"Right. She is also planning to add floors and I am thinking about preparing different types of traps."

"There are even floors? I see, that chibi Ramiris seems to be stronger than I imagined."

Upon hearing me say so, Veldora mirrored my serious expression. *You really are so, so gullible*. Next, I shared the entirety of the dungeon creation plan with Veldora.

"Isn't it boring to just have an ordinary labyrinth? That's why I'm trying to make it something awesome, a national brand. And today, I just discussed it with Ramiris. She is now working hard on expanding the floors."

"Oh oh. So what does it have to do with your favor from me?"

"Honestly, I need a king to rule over the dungeon---"

"---You say king?"

"The management of the labyrinth will be run by Ramiris and me. Then there is a gate on the hundredth floor that leads to Ramiris's home within the fairy maze. A guardian is required for that gate---no, we need the 'Strongest' guardian. Don't you think that makes sense, Veldora-kun?"

"It makes sense! I see, as expected of Rimuru. So you want to hand that job to me, am I right?"

As predicted, Veldora had been fooled by my sweet-talk. Since he didn't have much resistance against the word "Strongest", I figured I could definitely lure him into agreement with that.

"That's right, Veldora. Moreover, if you agree to this proposal, there's another bonus waiting for you."

"Oh? Although I've already decided to agree, let me hear about this bonus first."

Hehehe. This was not just a bonus; it was actually the most important reason.

"Didn't you want to release your youki all the time? And that you were almost at your limit?"

"What! Could it be..."

"Bingo! You don't have to hold back your youki any more in the labyrinth. You can even return to your original dragon form."

"Oh, ohoh...!"

"Think about it, a handsome dragon waiting at the depths of the labyrinth, giving off a solemn aura---"

"That's me, right?" Veldora interrupted. "If that's the case, I also get to unapologetically say to people: 'GAHAHAHAHAHA, you've finally arrived! Welcome, pathetic bugs!' and show off a little?"

He was already dying to give it a try. At the beginning he didn't even seem to have a single scrap of motivation, but upon hearing that he got to release his youki, he appeared to be very excited.

![break]

*How about I give it a final blow to seal the deal?*

![break]

Thinking about it, I began to mention the final plan that I'd discussed with Ramiris.

"I'll also be deploying some of my men there to defend against the adventurers. Yes, this is a game you've wanted to play for a while---I want to make it a reality. So, does it sound like fun?"

I expected to make the dungeon into something resembling a realistic simulation game. After hearing Ramiris's view, I suddenly got an idea.

*Deploying my men---aka monsters to fight and defeat adventurers. In order to guard the treasure chests, there will also be monster bosses. Veldora's magicules will flood the dungeon. Starting at the one hundredth floor, where the magicule concentration will be strongest, it will gradually thin out as it spreads across the floors above, which will have the desired effect of spawning relatively weak monsters in the upper floors, but progressively tougher ones lower down. The magicules leaked by Veldora during his sealed state was enough to spawn strong monsters such as Tempest Snakes at Rank A-minus. If it is Veldora now, I can't fathom how strong the monsters will be.*

Honestly, there really was no need to deploy guardians. I didn't see anyone even arriving at the hundredth floor, so there shouldn't be such worries. The most important thing was having Veldora release his youki. I figured that after telling him to endure, he was at his limit. If I left him unattended, he might find a place to relieve himself without permission when no one was watching, that's why I had to keep my eyes on him at all times.

If he accidentally released it in this region, apart from my executives and myself, any average people would be unable to tolerate it. With the magicule concentration spiking, people below Rank B might easily be killed. It would be asking too much to hope that Veldora would understand restraint, so Ramiris's labyrinth was to be a facilitating factor.

After all, the interior of the labyrinth was an isolated space. I had confirmed that while exploring it in the past, there was no need to worry about magicule leakage. Moreover, even if Veldora released his youki, it wouldn't shake the place. Even the sealed cave was unable to contain the youki released by Veldora after his full revival. Now that we established a research facility there, I couldn't allow him to release it in the cave again... That's why the dungeon was the ideal venue.

Then there's also the ultimate goal, the hope that Veldora would release his youki completely---simultaneously preparing high concentrations of magicules to spawn monsters. That was after all the core of this plan. Not only would we have Veldora release his youki, but we would be capitalizing on it effectively. How do I come up with these amazing ideas? It's killing two birds with one stone, actually, I should call it killing three birds. Not only would I be able to chase out Veldora who had been laying his nest in my house, I could have him be the magicule generator in the labyrinth to spawn monsters. Moreover, I got to give some work to this Veldora who had almost turned into a NEET.

Sadly for him, I didn't think he would ever get the chance to play the part of the final boss of the Labyrinth...

![break]

*All right, shall we see how he'll react?*

![break]

Veldora stood up and sneakily put his manga into his pocket. He then extended his hand towards me intending to shake my hand.

"Interesting. This thing sounds very interesting, Rimuru. Adventurers will fend off the minions and stand before me. Then I will get to teach these strong individuals a lesson. Of course, some adventurers will attempt to run away, but I will not let them off so easily! When times like that come, how about I say something like---'GAHAHAHAHAHA, you can't escape from my grasp. Don't you know? No one escapes from the claws of the one and only Storm Dragon---' I always wanted to try this line. Now am I finally getting the chance to deliver the line that I've been hoping to declare for so long? How exciting, I'm really looking forward to it!"

Spouting things like that, Veldora had now even begun daydreaming.

"Y-Yeah, you're right..." I gave the affirmative to him without thinking, but I might have gotten Veldora too excited...

*Will this guy be all right like this? Since, you know, by normal logic, there's not gonna be anyone who will have the ability to make it to the hundredth floor.*

Although I was a little bit concerned, I kept an open mind for the plan.

"---I figure this honor can only be handled by you, so what do you think?"

"Of course I will do it. Rimuru, you are so lucky to have come to me, I am after all the only one who could possibly fill this role!" he said, nodding his head earnestly. *I'm lucky that he's an idiot. I played him like a fiddle...*

![break]

And like that, I got Veldora's assistance with ease.

![soft scene break]

The next day---I paired up with Veldora to find Ramiris.

![break]

The construction work on the colosseum started early in the morning. The site was full of energy. Even the beastmen, who went out for training, had returned to help and were moving about under Gobkyu's instruction. Everyone was working their hardest, so in order to avoid disturbing them, we entered the labyrinth.

Upon entry, we found ourselves in the same room Ramiris was in... As promised yesterday, she seemed to be diligently expanding the labyrinth all this time.

"Oh, Ramiris. How are you doing?"

"Ah, Master! Long time no see, I've been good!"

Ramiris looked worn out but very satisfied as she made the response. It seemed she had been working too hard, even though I specifically told her not to overdo her part. Without me noticing, she had already sat down on Veldora's shoulder. The two looked so close, how wonderful.

Despite the wonderful things, there were still some remaining problems. Ramiris apparently wanted to show off her skills some more now that Veldora had come, and she was completely ignoring my reminder.

"Just count on me! I'll work hard. I'll definitely complete all of them!"

I just wanted Ramiris to calm down. The first thing we needed to do was to eat breakfast.

![break]

After finishing breakfast, Ramiris explained her progress to me. She had increased the size to fifteen floors. At this rate, we would reach the one hundredth floor in just a few days. The internal structure would be changed on the fly, so Ramiris didn't have to slow down for those plans.

"Anyway, the rest of the floors will be expanding by themselves," Ramiris said. "I'm pretty idle anyway, so why don't I do the interior design for the finished floors too?"

It seemed that even without Ramiris's conscious effort, the floors would increase automatically while consuming her power.

"Then, let's prepare Veldora's room first."

I planned to set Veldora's residence at the deepest level. In order to chase him out of my room, we would decorate the interior of his room first.

The bottom floor right now was a room devoid of anything. There were no walls, and naturally no hallways. There weren't even any stairs, we could only see an empty lot with a gate.

"This is truly empty I see."

"Oi oi oi, Rimuru, is this supposed to be my room? This really reminds me of the spot where I was sealed before..."

Veldora seemed kind of repulsed. That's somewhat pitiful really.

"It's all right, mentor! If I want, I can easily create walls and stairs."

Seeing how displeased Veldora looked, Ramiris replied grinning.

"Right, then, regarding what type of room we are decorating, we will discuss through our 'Telepathy Net' and decide."

With that being said, I promptly connected the three of us with 'Telepathy Net'. Then we began to construct an outline for the style of decoration based on my thoughts.

"Oh, ohoh! That's it, that's it, Rimuru! You are truly impressive. I see that there's really nothing for me to worry about when you are handling things."

*Did your satisfaction rate just suddenly cap out just like that?* Veldora nodded while humming "Hmmhmm".

![break]

"It seems that Veldora is completely satisfied, can we decorate it to this type of style?"

"Just count on me! This is a piece of cake!"

Ramiris took on the mission without hesitation. And just like she put it, the empty lot was changed in the blink of an eye. The walls turned into thick and heavy stone walls, several small rooms and a hall appeared. The hall was square shaped with one hundred meters for each side. The solemn atmosphere of the interior design resembled the so called "Final Boss Level." I transmitted the image in my head to her, and it turned out that she was able to recreate it wholly intact.

"You are so strong! This is just perfect..."

"Hmm, Ramiris, now I am satisfied!"

"Right, right! I am super strong after all!"

Ramiris probably seldom got praised by people, which was why she was overjoyed now. But even with that being said, she had been truly impressive this time. Building something like this in real life would likely not just take several years, but perhaps even decades to finish. Yet she completed it in the blink of an eye... It seemed that Ramiris held ultimate power over the dungeon and had complete freedom in shaping it.

*Ah, that's impressive, impressive indeed. I've completely changed my mind on Ramiris and now see her in a different light. But next, being impressed here alone won't make any progress.*

On the surface it appeared that this hall was a room to confront adventurers. But its true purpose was to allow Veldora to restore his original form. So if Veldora was unable to properly relax here, the effort would've been meaningless.

However, based on Veldora's recent activities, he did seem remarkably relaxed even without being in his dragon form... Since transforming into his human form, he could read manga and play games. This must've been the case. After all, he decided to stay in my room without leaving. Based on this, I decided to prepare a room tailored to his human form as well.

There were two gates in this hall. One of the large gates connected to the stairs to the upper floor, and the other gate lead to his private room for everyday use. Ramiris's ability to recreate things was indeed powerful, she could construct an exact replica of what I envisioned.

"Oh? Is this my room?"

While ignoring the intrigued Veldora, I took out a whole set of furniture from my 'Stomach'. I laid out the rug stitched by the goblinas and put out the tables and chairs built by the craftsmen. I'd even prepared benches, so he could lie down for a while if he wished. I even put out a bed, though I wasn't sure about whether it was necessary or not.

![exact fit image](image6)

*I think this will create a very comfortable space*. There were also shelves set on the walls with copies of the manga that Veldora liked. Unlike the solemn atmosphere the hall projected, this was built to be a comfortable space for private life that a commoner would enjoy.

"Nicu, nicu, very nicu, Rimuru-chan. I want that type of furniture too!"

After hearing how envious Ramiris sounded, I promised her that I would prepare a set for her as well. While I was originally worried about the size problem, that seemed to be unnecessary. Ramiris jumped onto the bench without hesitation and began to flip through manga. Speaking of this, it was the same during our last meeting. So I shouldn't overthink it and just prepare another set.

Without me noticing, even Veldora had begun to play around and started rolling on the bed. He looked contented. The hall had an emphasis on atmosphere, the majesty of that in contrast to this room and how Veldora was behaving stood in stark contrast. *Right, there are things we just can't force*. On this day we managed to sort out Veldora's room and with that dismissed our meeting.

![break]

After that, it took another whole week. Although we had slowed down a bit, the labyrinth had finally been built to a hundred floors. The interior designs were developed with modularity in mind. Thanks to this function, we were able to do an internal structural change every few days. Adventurers trying to memorize the layout would soon realize how futile those attempts would be. This design was truly evil.

Selling maps would be an option, however it would ruin the fun adventurers would have when they're forced to create a new map every time they enter. But to put it in another light, they wouldn't get bored this way... The labyrinth would always have a certain level of difficulty when being conquered, so that will never get old.

We at the very least had some measures to save progress. We placed a save point for every ten floors. I didn't expect that in Ramiris's labyrinth, you could conduct 'Spatial Movement' upon fulfilling certain conditions. More surprisingly, the act was said to be unaffected by magicule. It could even transport rations, which made it an extremely convenient function.

Of course, the same applied to humans and could transport them freely to any specific location. That was a save point. Once you reached it, you got to start from there in your next run. The same transportation method could be used by your companions too, so you could basically also cheat by having other people send you to a certain location.

We had differing views on this issue, but in the end, we took my suggestion to see how things would shape up before deciding on anything. Honestly speaking, cheating using savepoints would only give the people doing this a hard time. Since we were planning to put a boss on each floor. As the regional ruler of Jura Great Forest, I thought floor guardians were necessary components. Especially before reaching the save point set every ten floors, I wanted to deploy some especially strong monsters.

In other words, you couldn't use the save point unless you defeated these powerful individuals. If they were capable enough to break through, the companions brought by these strong individuals surely wouldn't be reckless. But if there was truly any problem, we would think about what to do by that time. In addition, I also wanted to prepare some treasure chests as rewards to incentivize defeating the bosses.

*But is it okay if the bosses are defeated?* Indeed, that was an important question. One of the abilities of Ramiris's 'Labyrinth Creation' was---the power of resurrection. Thanks to this skill, the adventurers inside it got to be revived.

As explained before, it required the will of the person, but the step would not be required if the individual had a ruler-subject relation with Ramiris. To my surprise, through the labyrinth created by 'Labyrinth Creation', Ramiris's subordinates seemed to be immortal. Ramiris would disappear upon being killed, but her subordinates could be revived at the save points. As for the subordinates we were referring to here, it applied only to those, who had forged a pact with her or to people that Ramiris acknowledged. This skill was undoubtedly a ferocious power beyond my imagination.

That was the biggest reason why she wanted Beretta. Ramiris herself was not that strong, but Ramiris's army inside the labyrinth was invincible. That was why to Ramiris, who didn't have a single subordinate, this invincible skill was as good as none at all. It was no use if it was a golem without will. The reason why the Elemental Colossus was destroyed is due to the fact that it was merely a doll.

Considering that, Beretta was no mere doll. After becoming Ramiris's subordinate, Beretta practically became immortal^[To be more specific, the term here is "不滅" (cannot be destroyed)] within this labyrinth. With the addition of Treyni-san now, Ramiris packed quite a bit more military power than I had initially expected. After all, the two were already very powerful before, now given the attribute of immortality, it was hard to say who would win even if I sent out Benimaru and Shion to confront them. Powerhouses such as Beretta and Treyni-san were now also very busy, but they had no complaints as they assisted the construction of the colosseum outside...

![break]

Thanks to Ramiris, the labyrinth had smoothly entered a stage of near completion. Once this thing was settled, I'd better find them both to discuss the defense mechanisms inside the labyrinth. However, that would come later.

"Ramiris, how is the item I asked you to prepare coming along?"

"Oh, you mean this? I've been trying to craft one."

The thing I asked her to prepare was the resurrection item. In order to obtain the attribute of "Immortality" from Ramiris's 'Labyrinth Creation', she must first receive confirmation of the individual's will. But it was to be expected that everyone who wanted to enter the labyrinth would use one. Since this was a facility accessible to anyone---it was simply too hard to confirm the personal will and form a pact with everyone. If there weren't a lot of people, Ramiris should be able to maintain control, but if too many people came in at the same time, Ramiris might not be able to keep up. That's why she designed a single-use disposable item---that's how she described it.

She took out a bracelet that, upon first glance, seemed like nothing special. It looked like a braided bracelet that you could tie on your wrist.

"About this thing, have you confirmed the effect?"

"It works great! I tried it on Beretta last night!"

"Hold up, hold up, why are you so mean to Beretta..."

I never expected that Beretta would say "I'm a demon, so I won't get eliminated regardless" at the time and offered his help happily. Although this was a request from me, they were still too reckless.

But that was worth the try, it was very useful in confirming the effect of the bracelet. Ten seconds after Treyni-san had pierced Beretta's core, his corpse was transported outside the dungeon and was completely revived.

"It seems perfect. I appreciate Beretta's courage."

"Hmm hmm. This is my first time making a single-use disposable item. Although I guessed it would come out smoothly, it's truly wonderful that I was actually able to make it," Ramiris nodded with a smile, it did sound like it was her first attempt.

It was worthy of celebration that it had been successful, but it was truly frightening to think of what would have happened had it failed. At least do an animal experiment first. I should be mindful of her doing something this reckless in future requests.

Regardless, the resurrection item had been prepared. The emergency escape item for returning to the surface also seemed to have been finished.

"Resurrection Bracelet ", "Return Whistle"---these we would be selling at the entrance of the labyrinth to prepare for the unknown. Whether the customers bought them or not was their choice. *However, please take responsibility for dying or getting lost in the labyrinth without the purchase.*

*It is a buy from me, absolute buy.*

![break]

I'd think about the price tag for it later. Regardless, the preparation work was done for now. By the way, this resurrection item called "Resurrection Bracelet " actually only temporarily materialized Ramiris's power. That's why you could only be revived at the entrance after dying inside the labyrinth to be reset.

In order to prevent anyone from misunderstanding its function and therefore expecting it to be able to revive them at any location, including outside of the labyrinth, we needed to give a thorough explanation. There were a lot of people in this world that ignored other people's advice, so I was a bit worried. If they really mistook things and ended up dying outside the labyrinth, it would be their own doing. Either way, I still couldn't bear to see that happening. I should just specifically remind the people to be careful with it.

![break]

With that, the dungeon was almost complete. How impressive that it only took a week. Perhaps Wisdom King Raphael-sensei could even recreate that incredible skill, upon thinking so, I tried to ask it---

![break]

<<Answer. Intrinsic Skill of Individual "Ramiris" cannot be recreated.>>

![break]

And like that it immediately turned me down. Such majestic work could only be achieved by Ramiris. At this point, I felt that I should tell her "Thank you for moving here".

"You have worked really hard, Ramiris. Now we can finally commence the next phase of our plan."

"Hehe, that's without saying! I always give my all when I need to!"

After praising Ramiris who was flapping her wings and flying around, I turned to Veldora.

"Kept you waiting huh, Veldora-kun. It seems the time for you to release your youki has arrived."

"Oh oh, finally after all the waiting! GAHAHAHA, leave it to me!"

The moment I'd been anticipating had finally arrived. There were air vents in this hundred-level dungeon and stairs that connected the floors. If people asked me how there was any air flow one hundred floors underground, I would answer by saying it was all because of magic. So honestly, there wasn't really any need for air ventilation, but I still asked her to open them, reason being to have the magicules permeate to each floor more easily.

![break]

There in the center of the hundredth floor's hall, Veldora revealed his true self. And with it, his long suppressed youki was released.

![break]

"Then, here I go. HYAA---!"

![break]

He didn't really need to scream like that, but it was probably because of his mood. The vicious youki blew towards me and Ramiris. Fearing an emergency, I had covered Ramiris with 'Absolute Defense' as well. The next instant, a shockwave arrived as if something had exploded.

"T-T-That was close... If Rimuru didn't protect me, I might have been blown away..." Ramiris muttered while quivering.

Indeed, the shockwave was far more powerful than I imagined. Moreover, any average person would have been instantly killed by the concentrated magicules that filled the chamber.

![break]

"GA---HAHAHA! I AM HERE!"

![exact fit image](image7)

The final boss level---correction, the deepest hall in the labyrinth took up a wide space, but after Veldora restored himself to his original shape, it felt awfully narrow.

After not seeing Veldora in his dragon form for so long, that appearance was indeed filled with majesty. *Ah, seriously, he's so authoritative when he shuts his mouth.*

However...

"I feel so good! Ah, aren't I just so magnificent? If I did this outside, it might not have been a good idea," he casually said.

*It will be a catastrophe if you do this outside. While you are saying that it feels so good, you are still leaking out youki.*

"M-Mentor sure is strong... I didn't expect that my own labyrinth would get knocked crooked by others..."

Just like Ramiris said, the walls had been bowed outwards by the ferocious wind. It was probably due to the strong internal pressure, but that wasn't the reason why the attack was so shocking.

"Should I call you impressive? You must have been holding back for so long. Before things end up like this in the future, you've got to remember to release your youki occasionally..."

Not only the youki he leaked, the magicule concentration alone was already sky high. It could only be imagined just how incredibly large Veldora's magicule pool was. That's why it was truly no good to wait for him to release it. In the worst-case scenario, he would have to start relieving himself more often one bit at a time.

By the way, the magicule concentration was truly immense. Just then an amazing idea crossed my mind. Should we perhaps set another room on the hundredth floor and turn it into a warehouse? We could then store the iron ores and other products from the mine in this room. Then by having them immersed in large amounts of magicule, they would be turned to magisteel ore very fast.

Magisteel ores are the rough stones of magisteel, its value could rival that of gold. The demand for them couldn't even be reached by iron ore, and to us they were also very useful resources.

"Ramiris, can you create an additional hall next to this one?"

"Hmm, piece of cake!"

And so, I hurried her to do the preparations. Upon my next visit, I'd bring the iron ore from the town here as well.

As I thought of these cunning schemes, the magicules spread to the other floors as planned. Right now there weren't any walls set up nor any other sort of areal partitioning. That's why there weren't any obstacles that hindered the magicules from permeating to every corner of the space. Even around underground level fifty, the magicule concentration was beyond that in the "Sealed Cave".

Its effect had exceeded my expectations, so basically it was an absolute win. Next, we just had to wait for monsters to be born. The concentration was so high that it was terrifying, so a lot of strong individuals should be spawning.

With that hope in mind, we dismissed the meeting for this day.

![soft scene break]

The next day, both Beretta and Treyni-san were present. Veldora seemed to have maintained his dragon form to release magicules and was resting on the ground.

"Hey, Rimuru, I haven't been as comfortable as I was yesterday for a long time."

"That's great then. You don't have to endure it anymore in the future, let go as much as you like. Just remember not to release any to the outside!"

"GAHAHA, I know."

Do you though? I was a little skeptical, but I chose to trust him.

It wasn't convenient to continue our conversation like this, so I asked Veldora to return to his human form. Then I started to explain the situation to Beretta and Treyni-san. Now we could get to work---I did want to say that indeed, there was still something before that.

I wanted a final confirmation from Beretta.

"Beretta, did you swear in front of Guy to pledge your loyalty to Ramiris? Has your sentiment changed since then?"

Beretta looked at me in shock. He must've been showing a rare change of expression under that mask.

"---Rimuru-sama, please forgive my rudeness. As I have said before, I hope to serve you and Ramiris-sama."

"Yes, I remember that. But, wouldn't that be breaking your vow with Guy?"

"...Yes. When that day comes, I'll take the responsibility myself---"

"No, you don't have to split hairs like that. As you have wished, Ramiris has moved to the town too. Now she is also responsible for running the labyrinth, do you wish to help her?"

"Of course!"

"If that's the case, there wouldn't be any problem. In terms of results, you are basically pledging your loyalty to me too."

I'd heard about this before, so I had the idea for quite a while already. If Beretta wished, I'd let him change to serving Ramiris. Since he had made a deal with the so-called strongest Demon Lord Guy, if he broke the vow Beretta wouldn't be safe.

"Won't you mind that? Then, I will serve Ramiris-sama," Beretta replied without hesitation.

I felt as though all of this had been part of Beretta's plan. *Well, never mind, that's fine either way. This cunningness, who in the world did he learn it from---*

![break]

<<Answer. It's of course--->>

![break]

*Ah, I don't want to hear that answer. How careless. What does Wisdom King Raphael-sensei think of me? Seriously, if it is anyone with such cunningness, it would be Raphael-sensei.*

![break]

<<...>>

![break]

It seemed to be slightly displeased, but I didn't care.

"That's fine. Then, Beretta, pledge your loyalty to Ramiris in the future!"

"Even though I will become Ramiris-sama's servant, I will not forget the gracious deeds done by Rimuru-sama. If I may ever be of any use to you, just say the word."

"All right, I'll count on you then."

As I finished my words, I deactivated the Creator Order (Master Lock) on Beretta and transferred "Master Access" to Ramiris. After the transference, I would only have access as the creator. If anything ever happened to Ramiris, the commanding right would return to me. But, as long as things didn't end up that way, Ramiris would always be Beretta's master.

Now I could be reassured. I wouldn't get bad-mouthed by Guy, and Beretta as Ramiris's guard was also trust-worthy.

![break]

I felt that there were surprisingly plenty of ways of using the labyrinth. On the surface, it appeared to be a promotional medium to attract adventurers. Further behind the scenes, it was a channel for Veldora to relieve himself. Lastly as its by-product---it turned iron ores into magisteel ores using high concentrations of magicule. This will do. It seemed that by researching the mysterious substance known as "Magicule" in this world, we got to run this labyrinth effectively. That was beyond my expectation, which heightened the importance of this labyrinth.

I wasn't entirely sure about handing the mission of protecting the place to Treyni-san alone, but now with Beretta, I was a lot more assured.

As for Ramiris who gained commanding power over Beretta... The quick turn of events had made her a bit hysterical.

"Beretta has really become my subordinate... Now I'm finally not alone---"

"Ah, Ramiris-sama, you still have me."

"Oh yeah! There's also Treyni, now I have a big family!^[The word here is "大所帯" which means "a large (family) organization", so it's more akin to "I've got this huge group now". But hell it's pretty wholesome so why not family.]"

Ramiris seemed overjoyed as she flew around Beretta. Treyni-san couldn't help but smile admiring the sight of her.

Ramiris had been alone all this time, she must've been very lonely. Even though she only had two subordinates, she still said they were a lot... This worries me. It worries me greatly.

Treyni-san was a very reliable person, yet she spoiled Ramiris too much. So Beretta would have to take on even more responsibilities, but I hoped someone with common sense like him would work hard too. He had the cunning and calculative side as well and would probably respond to my expectation.

"Beretta don't mind me for now. I'll have you take care of Ramiris. Please protect her well in the future."

"Yes Sir! I shall guard her with my life!"

I had confidence in him. I could rest assured as long as Beretta was there.

The management of monsters inside the labyrinth would probably keep Treyni-san's and Ramiris's hands tied if they handled them alone. So it wouldn't be a problem if they did encounter such things since Beretta was here. Things worked out smoothly.

![break]

Veldora and I felt somewhat agitated by Ramiris who was making excited noises, but then again, the sight did put a smile on our faces.

Given that an official master-servant relationship was made, Beretta had become "immortal" inside the labyrinth. Even without a "Resurrection Bracelet ", the mechanism could still be carried out perfectly. Treyni-san was without exception. The items such as "Resurrection Bracelet " and "Return Whistle" that possessed Ramiris's power were all watered-down versions of her skills. But, since Beretta and Treyni-san were now her followers, they could avoid the hassle of using them. The same logic applied for the location of resurrection, as long as the save point had been set beforehand, it is said that they could revive wherever they wanted and didn't have to be expelled out of the labyrinth every time. In addition, they could also do simplified 'Transportation' through the save point on each floor.

Speaking of Ramiris's Intrinsic Skill 'Labyrinth Creation', it really had little use for herself, but instead was highly beneficial for her subordinates. *By the way... Infinite revival, the thought alone sounds terrifying already. Right now she only has two subordinates, and once this number increases...*

In the future, there would gradually be monsters born in the labyrinth. If she could tame them, she might be able to form a Ramiris Legion. Then it would become a major power so people wouldn't look down on her and call her chibi. Such an army with the attribute of "Immortality" would pose a force to be reckoned with.

From a standpoint of defense, Ramiris's skill couldn't have been any better. The only problem with it was that the user of the skill was Ramiris herself, who to this day had not been anyone's concern.

*---But I guess it's just Ramiris after all. So there shouldn't be a problem and there is nothing to worry about. Such a cute fairy, she's just a chibi that is afraid of being lonely. That's why I don't think she will go lead a huge army and plot something like that---*

![soft scene break]

Now we were entering the next stage, it was time to plan out the internal structures of the labyrinth. Since there were as many as a hundred levels, designing the labyrinth really was a laborious task. But, it's not really a labyrinth if it doesn't have traps, so let's be interior designers for a while.

![break]

By the way, the first level of the labyrinth was square shaped, and the four sides were of 250 meters in length. It was large enough to rival Tokyo Big Egg (Tokyo Dome), but the deeper you went, the narrower it got. Structurally, it had an inverted pyramid shape. Since Veldora was releasing his youki on the bottom level, we built it like this so that it would be convenient for youki to spread out evenly. Almost every condition we considered had been fulfilled, it could be said that the structure we designed went beyond common sense. But there's no point breaking our heads overthinking such things.

Now, time to confirm what sort of traps to deploy:

![break]

-   Poison Arrow: Arrows smeared with poison will fly your way out of nowhere.

-   Poison swamp: ~~Welcome to Farron Keep 2.0,~~ super poisonous swamp that you will recognize instantly from the mere look of it. Stepping in will give you ailment status and HP reduction due to poisoning.

-   Spinning surface: You spin me right round to disorientate me. Please remember the importance of drafting maps!

-   Shifting surface: Floors that will run away on their own, how terrifying.

-   Dismembering Razor-string: If you run into it without noticing, you will get your head chopped off (among other limbs). It's gonna be quite vicious when paired up with shifting surface.

-   Booby trap pit: Compared to the injuries you get from dropping into it, you should be more concerned about what you will encounter down there.

-   Mimic chest: Amazing, it's a treasure chest? Sorry but, KONO MIMIC DA!

-   Exploding chest: Amazing, it's a treasure chest! EXPLOSION!

-   Monster cabin: Howdy! Are you our delivery? It's pizza time!

-   Sealed room: If you start a fire here...

-   Dark level: Shouldn't bringing torches be common sense? If you didn't, I can sell you some for, say, ~~3000 souls~~ a huge markup.

-   Low ceiling floor: Wow, didn't expect to encounter any monster while crawling on the ground now did you...

-   Terrain effect level: WTF?! Why is there a volcano in this labyrinth?

-   ~~Rimuru Tempest: Arguably the deadliest trap.~~

![break]

That's about it, something along these lines. I listed all the traps I could come up with to her and it turned out that almost all of them could be created.

"You are truly capable, Ramiris. Are you really able to make these types of traps?"

"Hmm! Inside the labyrinth, I can make whatever I want!!"

Indeed, it was just like how Ramiris put it. Now even though we were one hundred floors down, the air composition was no different from that on the surface. This was all thanks to Ramiris's skill. It illustrated once again how super strong her skill was.

"By the way, what is this 'Sealed Room'? Can it really be a booby trap?"

To her question, I cracked up a smile and replied, "Air---or I should say that there is a substance in the atmosphere called oxygen. Humans, or perhaps most creatures, will take in oxygen by breathing. Veldora and I are exceptions. If the concentration of oxygen drops too low, people will suffer hypoxia and may even die on the spot. That's why adventurers should be cautious when faced with a room like that. After all, that's a fixed rule of exploration."

In general, it was fine if a room were sealed, but if you lit a fire inside, it would lead to a state of oxygen deprivation or may even cause the room to be filled with poisonous gases. Even if you discovered this type of room in ruins or labyrinths, you couldn't immediately rush in. You must analyze the components of the atmosphere first and hold a skeptical view regarding whether there was poisonous gas remaining and assessing the concentration of the oxygen.

That is the basic rule of exploration, if an adventurer can't even do that, he won't last long. And since magic exists in this world, at least do the breathing with wind-element magic.

I explained this in a way that Ramiris could easily understand---although she didn't seem to understand at all.

"Okay, I get now that it is some vicious trap. But it doesn't really affect us, so we don't have to pay too much attention to it, right? By the way, you... I had the feeling before that you were a pretty scary guy. But you also seem very capable. If it were me, I wouldn't be able to come up with a trap like that..."

Knowing that they themselves wouldn't have to worry about being harmed by the trap, Ramiris seemed to be reassured. She exclaimed so and praised me. She seemed to really believe what she said, and that kind of embarrassed me. If it were people who enjoyed gaming from my original world, they should be very familiar with these traps and even feel somewhat intimate with them.

But making them real is a horse of a different color. It was nothing like some amusement rides, you might pay with your life because of them. Moreover, attempting to overcome a labyrinth with these traps would likely take a couple of days. They might even take a few days just to take on a few levels, plus the terrain will alter, one must try to go all the way to the save point at the tenth floor.

If it was someone like us who had poison nullification and did not require breathing, eating or even sleeping, they should be able to conquer it using brute force by just tanking the damage. But this was not something average people were capable of. Even those who were worthy of the title of hero would need to rest. I personally was convinced that it would be quite the vicious labyrinth.

"Are we perhaps setting the difficulty too high?"

"Is it? I find it okay."

"Yeah, Rimuru. This is really nothing!"

My worries were laughed off by Veldora and Ramiris. If that's the case, then there shouldn't be a problem. I was persuaded and continued brainstorming the labyrinth routes.

![break]

A few days passed after that, during which Ramiris joyfully prepared all sorts of traps. Beretta and Treyni-san had been deploying them alongside her. I had planned out the labyrinth route with Veldora. We came up with several different models and registered them first so we could make the change anytime we needed. Everything had been going smoothly, but when we attempted to add "Terrain Effect", Ramiris raised an objection.

"No, no no no. I can't sustain that much energy!"

To put it simply, she had a problem with it.

---Actually, it made sense. In terms of the layout---we wanted every level to have a specific natural disaster theme that would cover the entire level. For example a fire level, frozen level or a storm level.

*Yeah, I guess creating a volcano is a no-go. I've come to believe that anything can be done with magic, but what I was asking for is simply too much.*

"I see you have a point. Sorry, Ramiris, I was being too difficult---"

I gave up and decided to apologize to Ramiris. But then---

"Can't that be solved if you capture a fire or ice dragon from somewhere? Do you need my help to catch some?"

What a familiar voice, but, that person shouldn't be here. I turned around to see a pair of platinum pink ponytails.

It was Milim.

"Eh...? What are you doing here, Milim---"

![break]

This was level one hundred underground. In other words, this was the very bottom level of the recently built dungeon. We hadn't even made this location public, so by any rational logic she shouldn't have been able to enter...

Yet she just did---Demon Lord Milim stood there with a smug smile.

By the way, Wisdom King Raphael-sensei seemed to have noticed that, but since Milim didn't have hostile intent against me, it intentionally didn't report to me... But actually, it was me who told it to do that. Though I should still reassess the command. It's all because Raphael-san doesn't know how to be flexible, what a headache.

![break]

<<...>>

![break]

That will be a topic to discuss in the future, right now let's deal with Milim. Upon thinking this, I turned to Milim. And soon after, she remarked complacently: "Fufu, I know that you guys have been up to something interesting, so I came by to see. And you've ousted me without notice, how dare you, Rimuru."

Milim finished with an arrogant posture while straightening her plotless, flat chest.

She was wearing her usual highly revealing clothes, but the area covered by clothing seemed to be more than last time. After being dressed by Shuna and the goblinas, she may have become a bit more self-aware about dressing up in public. On her fists were the pair of drago knuckles that clashed with the rest of her attire. The light reflecting off its rough surface was emphasizing their existence. It was very much Milim's style, she really was just a punk kid after all.

![exact fit image](image8)

I couldn't bring myself to reject her, so if she really wanted to join the development---

"Heh, so it's Milim. You are just a brat, how could you understand the sublime work of us adults? We are not playing around here, don't get in our way!"

Veldora slanted towards Milim and exclaimed so while feeling justified. I didn't have time to respond before he interjected. It was work in name indeed, but this didn't seem like serious work at all... Not only him, even Ramiris decided to chase after Veldora's footsteps.

"Mentor is right!" she yelled, confronting Milim. "We are working here, so an idler like you should just go home!"

The poor chibi was immediately trapped in Milim's iron grasp. Her courage was commendable, but Ramiris, you don't really have the strength to back it up.

I lacked that sort of courage, so I decided to ask in a normal way.

"You mentioned that we are doing something interesting, what were you referring to? It was all because of your letter that we are holding this grand festival."

"What? Didn't you ignore my letter?"

"How is that possible? Seriously, we are doing this to receive demon lords, so we can't just offer the bare minimum, can we?"

Up until now Milim was looking displeased, but after learning that she hadn't been ignored, she immediately regained her jovial mood, to the displeasure of someone else.

"Hold on, Rimuru! I'm a demon lord too! I'm just like you and Milim, a member of the Octagram!"

Seeing that Milim had received different treatment than herself, Ramiris began to throw a tantrum.

"Ramiris, there's no such thing as receiving you at all, didn't you move here without permission?!"

"What? What do you mean by moving here? Ramiris, could it be that you are living with Rimuru now?"

After being pursued by questions from Milim and me, Ramiris was now the one who had lost her cool---

"That's right! I was not invited, but that's not important at all! Also I'm not gonna be alone in the future anymore now that I'm living with Rimuru too!"

---Or so I thought that she has just lost her cool, instead she dropped this easily misunderstood statement.

"How cunning and cheeky of you! I want to live here too!"

"Hehe---! I came here for work. I'm helping Rimuru, not a guest like you who can only give trouble to people."

"What! How dare you say that, you are just a---"

Milim was furious and began to argue with Ramiris, who was not backing down either, even though she had no chance of winning, she accepted the challenge.

As for me, I just stood back and watched to avoid being affected. With that being said, if Milim begins to resort to violence in her confrontation, there would be no need to use verbal arguments. That's why their conflict was but a verbal quarrel. The two were arguing against each other, but it looked pretty pathetic since both were lacking in the vocabulary department. Their exchanges of insults were all awful and would probably only make any bystander laugh.

Sometimes Ramiris would deliver a flying kick at Milim, to which Milim would chase after her in an attempt to grab onto Ramiris. It was like a game of tag, to any bystander, they would feel that they were just playing around with each other and they were actually on good terms. These two fellows had long been acquainted, so perhaps this was also a reflection of their affection for each other.

![break]

Soon after, they suddenly held back midway through their quarrel, putting an abrupt end to the argument---because Shuna came by with desserts prepared in hand and scolded the two upon seeing this.

"No dessert for anyone who's fighting!"

And because of these words, the two suddenly quieted down. The two who had made peace were now eating desserts together with much love. The scene suddenly became so harmonious, but I still had to ask Milim what she came for.

"By the way, Milim, why did you come here anyway?"

"Fufu, didn't I just say? I feel as though you guys are doing something interesting."

"No no no, eh, is that really the only reason?"

"Yep. But, I'm so lucky to have come. This thing called cake is the best, and this labyrinth thing also looks quite interesting. I didn't expect that Ramiris would have been so useful."

"Fufu---! I'm just like everyone else who has kept my power a secret. It's just that you didn't manage to discover it!"

Even though you say that, you yourself didn't discover it either, Ramiris---That's just my thought, I should keep it to myself. By the way, this girl Milim was really keen to spot an idea of this size. There was really nothing that could be hidden from Milim. She was already someone who had ex-Demon Lord Karion and Frey as followers, and the speed at which she got here was truly shocking.

Basically, Milim was a wild card. Normally speaking, how was it possible for someone to run around outside all by herself, but it was not that surprising if that someone was Milim. It was really nothing to be astounded by if she showed up here. I'll need to keep this in mind.

![break]

"All right, now that we are done eating desserts, it's about time to get back to work. Also Milim, if you won't interfere, you can stay and play."

How rare, Veldora-san had given a mature response. Now that I thought about it carefully, it would be a problem if these two (Veldora and Milim) started arguing. Because her opponent was Ramiris, Milim held herself back. But it might not have been the case if it was Veldora.

The labyrinth facilities we put so much effort in to set up would be affected by their brawl and probably be destroyed instantly. It seemed that Milim didn't hold a grudge against Veldora, so we're safe for now.

"Since mentor has said so, I don't object either."

It seemed that Ramiris had also agreed. Speaking of this, Milim was surprisingly on good terms with Ramiris, she was just intentionally playing tricks on her from the start.

"Just count on me! I won't be a hindrance, so give me some work as well!"

Milim's mood had improved and she appeared to be willing to join us. I personally didn't have an objection, I was going to agree without hesitation, but there was something on my mind. There was a point I needed to confirm first.

"If that's the case, can we have Milim join as well---"

"Hmm! Such an interesting thing, you should have come for me during the planning phase!"

"I get it, but putting that aside---Milim, won't your subordinates object? Did you actually get the permission from Karion-san and Frey-san?"

Although she appeared to be so wild and care-free, this girl was still a demon lord after all. Moreover, she had now taken the two ex-Demon Lords Frey and Karion as subordinates and even took Clayman's territory to become an overlord ruling over a huge area of land. Though the management of the land had been handed to Karion and Frey, she should have gotten much busier, at least in comparison to how it was before.

*Is Milim right now really allowed to stroll around like this so freely? Eh, that goes for me too? I'm honestly fine. My subordinates are all very capable, so I should just avoid interfering with them. Moreover, I really am doing and carrying out plans. I'm even doing planning now to attract tourists, so I'm definitely not slacking.*

Putting my own matters aside, the focus was on Milim. After being asked by me, Milim averted her eyes.

"I guess...? You see, I'm very bright... Right? I definitely didn't flee here because I hate studying!" Milim said incoherently.

---I see. Frey had been in charge of investigating and summarizing reports on different nations. She must have handed the data she collected to Milim in hopes of teaching her about ruling. But Milim escaped because of her dislike of it, that seemed to be the truth.

"I don't care! I just want to join no matter what!"

I wasn't able to say anything before Milim opened up first rejecting me. Very impressive, Milim's instinct was exceptionally keen. Honestly, I should contact Frey or Karion now---But, never mind, I guess.

I wouldn't be the one getting scolded anyway. "I know nothing of this," that's how it will go.

Compared to that---something Milim had said made me very curious.

"All right! You are the one getting scolded anyway, so I'll drop the matter. Let's talk dragons, dragon! Just now you said something about capturing a dragon, right? Is that really possible?"

"Uh! So I will get scolded indeed? No, but... It can't be helped. As the saying goes, adventure always comes with risk..."

Milim was a like a kid who wasn't scared about getting scolded for skipping classes and homework to play outside. Honestly, I couldn't save her, this was the road she chose for herself. Standing by and observing was part of the duty as an adult.

After some internal struggle, Milim chose fun over work.

"You mean the dragons. They can be captured. Should I go find some?" she answered without hesitation and seemed to have switched up her mood. While saying it as if she was going to catch some beetles, she proposed we go catch some dragons.

That's just what I needed right now.

"Uh, can I ask for that favor from you? If that's the case, what types of dragons are out there? Are they related to the True Dragons?"

Since she wanted to help by catching some, of course I'd ask for this small favor. I bore such thoughts in mind while asking, to which Milim and Veldora both reacted.

"Rimuru, dragons are different from 'True Dragons'."

"Right. It's not as if you were Luminas, it's simply wrong for you to mix me up with those lizards!" the two objected strongly.

So as a follow up to the conversation, I inquired about the details of dragons.

![soft scene break]

"---Basically, all of the dragon races in this world originated from my big bro, the strongest True Dragon, Star King Dragon Veldanava. They are just monsters born carrying a diluted version of his likeness^[The phrase used here is "因子" which means "factor"/"Element", but I think it's something more akin to "bloodline"/"Gene" in this context. But since spiritual life form doesn't really have flesh, so it doesn't really apply.]."

Veldora began to explain in detail as our conversation proceeded. There was a basic but critical difference between the two kinds, that was the difference between material life form and spiritual life form. As a monster, the dragon possessed a physical body. It was only called a dragon due to its similar appearance to a True Dragon, but its nature was more akin to that of a dinosaur or in simpler terms, a giant, fierce lizard.

While it was said that there were in total four True Dragons in this world, right now only three remained. Veldora's elder brother, Milim's father Star King Dragon Veldanava was destroyed due to ~~nutting in the wrong species~~ a certain reason and had shown no sign of being resurrected anytime soon.

True Dragons were immortal beings, however, people believed that there was more to that attribute...but anyhow, let's put that aside for now.

The origin of dragons could be traced to this Star King Dragon, more precisely, it could be traced to the pet gifted to Milim by the Star King Dragon, Spirit Dragon (Elemental Dragon)^[This is a case of katakana annotation confusion. Its annotation is "Elemental Dragon" when it's called "Spirit Dragon" in Kanji. Will be referring to it as 'Spirit Dragon' to differentiated from 属性**竜** (Elemental Dragon), which is a type of Arch Dragon.].

Comparing this to the story Elen told me, that Spirit Dragon was no doubt the deceased Chaos Dragon. Nowadays in regions with concentrated magicules, there seemed to be Lesser Dragons spawning and dragons who inherited more elements of Spirit Dragon became Greater Dragons (Arch Dragons).

In addition, there were also more powerful dragons among the Arch Dragons, they were the dragon lords that represented the four elements. After living hundreds of years after evolving to an Arch Dragon, and then having their wisdom increased even farther---these were the dragon lords. After evolving, they seemed able to utilize part of Spirit Dragon's power and no longer aged as they grew older. They were nearly a semi-spiritual-life-form. But unlike True Dragons, once they were eliminated, they were dead for good.

I recalled that the sky dragon I beat was an Arch Dragon, its threat level was at Rank Calamity. Dragon lords are stronger than that, they could probably rival a demon lord. In other words, perhaps they could compete with Clayman and Greater Spirits, or were perhaps even stronger than them.

If they had that large of a magicule pool, they should be able to easily gain control over the terrain effects of each floor.

![break]

"Hold on, no matter how strong I am, I won't be able to capture the mighty dragon lords!" Milim hurriedly exclaimed, afraid that I may have misunderstood.

If she said so then it must be the case. It would be impossible to tame dragon lords who possessed intelligence. We might persuade them by asking for a favor, but the problem we were facing this time didn't require us to go quite that far.

"You have a point, then which ones are you catching?"

"Hmm! Although they cannot rival dragon lords, there are Arch Dragons who do possess elemental attributes. We will be catching and taming those guys and let them consume magicule and help change the terrain."

I see. The dragons seemed to make their own nests, so they may modify their domain based on their needs.

All the necessary components had been prepared, and the magicule was filled to the brim. So I'd take Milim's suggestion.

"Can I count on you?"

"Leave it to me! Some of the dragons with elemental attributes may soon evolve to dragon lords, so I'll capture one for each element."

According to Milim's explanation, there were four elements that developed from the Spirit Dragon. For each element---the dragon lords of Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind were at the top of the food chain, followed by Elemental Dragons, forming a tree graph. There were four types of Elemental Dragons as well. They were the Fire Dragon, Ice Dragon, Wind Dragon, and Earth Dragon.^[The kanji names sound a lot cooler; they are Dragon of Flame (火炎竜), Dragon of Frost (冰雪竜), Dragon of hurtling Wind (烈風竜), Dragon of Shattering-Earth (地碎竜)] The sky dragon I beat seemed to have been a subspecies that failed to evolve into a Wind Dragon. Unlike spirits, they didn't have the element of "Air".

It was also said that there were mutated dragons and ones that received special evolution, in human's words, they were called having (too much) personality.

![break]

Anyhow, now we could expect levels with terrain effects. If Milim does catch the dragons, we should put them at lower levels. By the way, the Elemental Dragons were stronger than their non-elemental cousins. A rough estimation of their strength was around Special Rank A, a powerful species. Even though they couldn't really compete with Charybdis, they were still very strong.

I didn't put too much thought in it. But in fact, a normal dragon could already rival six Holy Knights, or it was said to be able at least. But Elemental Dragons, even sending out a whole squad of Holy Knights might not necessarily be able to eliminate it... Still that's none of my business.

I'm not gonna care about that, but I've decided where to put my focus. The counters among the five main elements of spirits were as follows---Earth countered Air, Air countered Wind, Wind countered Water, Water countered Fire, Fire countered Earth. But the strength of Elemental Dragons didn't seem to be affected by this countering effect.

Although the elements countered each other, combat experience seemed to be far more important. In simpler terms, an older dragon surpassed a younger dragon. So I could put them wherever I wanted.

![break]

**Floor 99: Fiery Hellscape**

The final level surrounded by scorching flames. You must wear heat-resisting equipment, but what could be awaiting ahead...?

**Floor 98: Icy Prison**

Pause your footsteps and you will die. Will you make it with cold-resistant gear?

**Floor 97: Electric Skies**

Thunder from the heavens is posing an omnipresent threat, whether you can overcome it will depend on your luck!

**Floor 96: Raging Earth**

As if it is mocking the people arriving at the level, vicious earthquakes greet you. Behold the fury of dragons!

![break]

That's about it.

Before they were able to fight the final boss Veldora, we would prepare these terrain effect levels with ultra-difficulty. Then there would be no problem at all. By any stretch of normal logic, there's no way anyone could defeat all these.

"Nice job, Rimuru!"

"Kukuku, so you are deploying low-lives before me. After seeing those imposters, the adventurers will lower their guards, and it will be my time to shine!"

"Uh, it is so awesome to have someone like Veldora to play that type of character. I want to try and be the final boss sometimes!"

The three each had a point that made them satisfied. I was also very happy about it. The only thing was, these pivotal dragons had yet to arrive, so I hoped that we were not celebrating for nothing. Upon thinking so, I decided to coddle Milim a bit.

"What are you talking about, Milim. It is all thanks to you that we are able to complete this final trap!"

"!"

"That's right, Milim! I'm relying on you this time as well, remember to catch some strong and handsome dragons and bring them here!"

"Hmm, count on me!"

Seemingly having noticed my intention, Ramiris joined in to assist my ploy. It appeared to have worked as Milim was suddenly bursting with motivation. Now I could rest assured for a while.

As long as we had dragons, the traps could be deployed smoothly. It was fine to not put any effects on these floors, because as soon as Milim captured the dragons to build their nests here, they would become ferocious traps themselves.

As a result Milim went out to catch some dragons, adding to Ramiris's growing number of underlings.

![soft scene break]

A few days had passed since the day when Milim suddenly showed up and left. The setting of traps had been completed, all we needed to do now was wait for Milim to return with the captured dragons.

"Ah, Beretta-san, Treyni-san, thanks for your hard work."

"There's no such thing, all of these are for Rimuru-sama and Ramiris-sama."

"Indeed. I also feel overjoyed to work for Ramiris-sama."

Beretta was acting very humble as usual in his response. As for Treyni-san, she had Ramiris sitting on her shoulder while looking thrilled. It looked like she'd be willing to take any command from her.

All right, now most of the things were completed---

"Right, Rimuru-sama, these things have been left with me for a while."

After saying so, Beretta displayed some unique-grade weapons and gear.

"This is..."

"These were liberated from a certain magic doll subordinate of Clayman. I didn't have the chance to hand these to you then, but I think they will be quite suitable to be put in the treasure chests---"

*Oh oh, now that you mention it. It's from that greatest masterpiece of Clayman or something like that, was it called Viola?*

Viola was strapped with weapons all over its body, which Beretta had taken the entirety of as loot. He had offered them to me previously, which I refused, because the demand he gave was the permission to move here. At the time Beretta complied with my decision and brought those things home...

"Didn't you offer them as gifts to Ramiris?"

Someone reacted to my doubts, not Beretta, but Ramiris.

"Hehe! I figured that I couldn't really use them, so I'm not really that interested. They are indeed very strong weapons, but they can't be modified too much. But even so, we kept them in hopes that they may be useful one day, that's the decision we made after I discussed it with Beretta!"

"Is this really okay? You should be able to make a lot of money by selling them."

"It's okay, it's okay. Because I have a job to do now too! I'll probably be collecting money in troves in the future, so why be so petty now! Besides, we get to have a place of residence by doing so too."

In this way Ramiris offered the weapons and gear to me, to which I expressed my gratitude and decided to put them to good use.

So that's how it went down. *Let's get started with setting up the treasure chests and confirming the progress on the labyrinth*. We began by examining the condition of the dungeon starting at underground level 1.

![break]

The initial level was just for testing out your skill. It was designed so that even rookies could proceed safely. The width of the hallways inside the labyrinth area was also very large, so structurally it wouldn't easily cause people to get lost.

With that being said, four sides, each being 250 meters in length, was quite spacious. Investigating the hallways alone would be hard work and there wasn't even much loot after walking all this time. This type of floor would likely lead to these situations. Having empty hallways alone probably wouldn't attract any customers, but luckily there was a large number of weak monsters patrolling the area, so it shouldn't be an issue. People could get magic ore from these monsters and practical items from their corpses. There were still a lot of rewards.

This loot would be purchased by us. There wasn't a Freedom Association branch in this town, and the nearest was the Blumund Branch, which would be too tiring for adventurers to reach, so I figured that our nation could buy it at a cheap price with a cost difference that canceled out the transportation expense. It seemed like a pretty good idea. I was going to discuss with Yuuki to ask him the favor of building a Freedom Association branch in our nation, which was also a good idea anyway. Until that was done, we'd adopt this method for the time being instead.

![break]

Until underground level five, we are only making the labyrinth slightly more complex without any major changes.

However, the situation would become dire from level six onward. All sorts of traps would be lying in wait. With that being said, up until underground level nine there may be vicious traps, but no one should be killed by the traps alone. If these were skillful adventurers, they shouldn't suffer too much.

If the difficulty were set too high, we wouldn't get returning customers and we wouldn't be able to negotiate anything with them then. That's why the first nine levels were designed to be more beginner-friendly.

![break]

Next up was the indispensable floor ten. That floor had a slightly stronger monster placed in the room. This was the so-called boss level. By defeating the boss, the gate leading down to the lower floors would open.

"Rimuru, what type of monster will you be deploying there?"

"About that, I'll decide depending on what type of monsters are born... But I haven't spotted one?"

That's right, in fact up until level ten underground, I haven't seen a single trace of a monster. Although it has been ten days since Veldora released his youki, there isn't any sign of monsters spawning.

![break]

<<Answer. Even while hiding his youki, monsters can sense the aura of individual "Veldora". Deducing that no monster dares to approach him.>>

![break]

Ah, I see.

"Veldora's release of magicules seems to have helped spawn some monsters, but they seem to have sensed Veldora's aura, making them too frightened to dare approach."

"What! So that's why... It's no wonder that none of the monsters in the sealed cave showed up."

After hearing my explanation, Veldora suddenly came to a realization. But weaker monsters couldn't really endure the aura either, so that was probably the main reason.

"All right, just try to find one when you are available next time. I estimate to put at least a Rank B monster that is slightly strong on level ten."

"Oh---got it. But if there isn't any intelligent fellow, we shouldn't add it to my servants. Just bring it to the room and put this collar on it!"

Since Ramiris had spoken, I decided to take the collar. It was said that by wearing it, one could revive an infinite amount of times, even without making a pact with Ramiris. Then there would be no need to find replacements once they were defeated, how useful.

"Oh oh, this is so convenient. It will save a lot of work."

"Right? Anyhow, in this labyrinth, reality can be whatever I want!"

It was indeed the case as Ramiris put it. She could also change the ability given on each item, Ramiris's skill was truly versatile. I once more lamented my inability to recreate her skill.

Now the problem with the bosses was resolved as well. Floor ten would only have the boss room, and it would be safe after defeating the boss. After this level, there would be a save point and the stairs leading to the lower levels, just these two.

Right, right, I can't forget about the treasure chests. There was no trap in the treasure chest. The only difference was that we would be moderating the drop rate of weapons and gear. I estimated there to be hidden rooms after that floor, so I'd set up treasure chests with traps. And following level 20, there would even be fake treasure chests.

*This was somewhat distasteful, predatory one might say, but I suppose you could call that giving a sense of clarity and a reminder during the exploration of the labyrinth. When they experience it in the field, they should come and thank me instead.*

It was not entirely a bad thing. The inside of the labyrinth was full of magicules, so the equipment might even become magic swords or magic spears after some time. Since they were getting such precious rewards, encountering danger should be expected. They wouldn't die as long as they had a "Resurrection Bracelet ", so it would be more exciting to be cruel, and reasonably speaking, more interesting. I was really looking forward to what type of reaction the adventurers would give.

And like that, the inspection work for level ten was complete.

![break]

"What should we do next? Should we create a facility to buy back the items obtained by people from the monsters or for them to deposit the items?"

"Hmm---do we really need that? Because, if we have that type of facility, 'Return Whistle' will not sell well."

I suppose that's right too. Ramiris's comment was an on-point rebuttal. She did have a point. She was apparently quite perceptive when it came to money.

"Indeed, putting this type of facility on a level with a save point does make it meaningless. Should we perhaps pick the middle ones, to make levels ending in five be safe zones?"

"Hmm hmm, that should work!"

We should make them available for storing items looted by adventurers and selling healing potions among other items at high prices. Building a meal area would be nice too.

We didn't have to put all these facilities on different floors, we just needed to make sure these floors all had access to the same location. This was so creating them would not take too much work. Maybe there were many who wanted to rest outside instead of inside?

Well, that depends. "Return Whistle" was an item for emergency usage, so it would be fine to sell it at a higher price.

![break]

That part I could think about after the festival concluded.

![soft scene break]

That's about it, everyone was taking the opportunity to shoot their opinions at each other in the discussion while examining each floor. As such, we did a thorough check as we smoothly built up the labyrinth.

We later were able to finish confirming level 100, and the result was satisfying. Simply describing the completed labyrinth with the word vicious would not do it justice.

![break]

<<Based on the strength of average adventurers, labyrinth set with low-level monsters already poses sizable difficulty. In addition with cruel traps and high-level monsters spawned, it is significantly insufficient to describe it with the term viscous--->>

![break]

*Eh, what? I didn't catch you clearly*. Raphael-sensei seemed to be quite baffled by it. But of course, it must've been me thinking too much.

![break]

---Later I was going to have a profound experience that proved I wasn't thinking too much at all.

![break]

I decided to pick the bosses from among the spawned monsters, but it turned out that the monsters in the labyrinth were already overcrowding it.

"W-What the hell---!" I shouted, but it was all too late. I went through a very hard time trying to adjust the difficulty, but I suppose I had it coming... Whatever, it didn't matter if I had a problem with it. I would consider this as a minor miscalculation and quickly toss it to the back of my mind.

![break]

Many things happened in between, the rest would be handled by Veldora and Ramiris who were fully motivated. The dragons caught by Milim had been placed in their respective levels, and the magicule concentration of each level had also been moderated. There were also the automatically spawned monsters, who likely due to the deployment of dragons, were no longer so concentrated. After such influence, right now the bosses were only planned up to level 30, so I wouldn't think too much over this.

On the surface, the construction of the colosseum was still underway, the speed at which its skeletal framework was proceeding was incredible. It should be able to catch up to the Founding Festival after the snow melts. And as for this labyrinth that lay underground, it had become an amazing recreational facility that far exceeded my expectations. Even though people needed to purchase a "Resurrection Bracelet " first before entering, as long as you had that, anyone would want to check it out at least once. I intended to make it our main attraction in the future to capitalize on its expected effects.

![break]

There were still many ideas of mine awaiting to be carried out, but we would be done for now. We all wore an evil grin and looked at each other in agreement. With that, the preparation work for the labyrinth was concluded for now.

Though the preparation work for the festival was still going on, there were already some unfamiliar faces showing up in town. The snow was beginning to melt, and the visitors from all over the Jura Great Forests were arriving one by one to our nation.

![break]

The prelude to our nation-founding festival was soon to be unveiled---
