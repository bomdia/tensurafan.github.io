# Chapter 1: Reconciliation|and Pacts

I was exhausted after the whole incident. Everything was finally settled. It was more tiring than fighting against Hinata---but let's keep that a secret.

As for what happened during that time---

.........

......

...

The Western Holy Church believed in the God Luminas, whose real identity was Demon Lord Valentine. Her real name seemed to be Luminas Valentine, and according to her, she had previously granted her subordinate the title for him to proclaim himself as Demon Lord Valentine. However, Veldora revealed Luminas's identity during the Walpurgis Banquet and ended her disguise forever...

The Holy Knight Order under Hinata's command was able to win the peoples' support by standing against Demon Lord Valentine. Yet this was all pre-orchestrated, which Hinata seemed to know all along as well. It doesn't seem wrong logically speaking, but is this really okay?

"It really can't be helped. I tried to stop it but was defeated by Luminas-sama. However, Luminas-sama seems to have no interest in gaining popular support at all---" Hinata explained rather helplessly, seemingly noticing my concern. She didn't seem to approve such practices either, yet she had no choice but to follow along after her defeat against Luminas.

With that being said, Luminas had agreed to not harm any civilians. Hinata seemed to have made up her mind that as long as Luminas stuck to that promise, she would obey her every whim.

Regardless, Hinata did not arrange this.

"Indeed. I was the one who drafted the plan. My brother Roy also backed me up. In fact, this whole thing has little to do with Luminas-sama. Hinata objected to it from the start and even tried to defeat us, so if you have a problem with this, talk to me instead of her," said the man who arrived with Luminas, following Hinata's words. I recalled that he had been referring to himself as Pope Louis.

"Should I call you Pope Louis...-dono? -san? Which one?"

Louis replied to me with a dry smile and said: "Or you can just call me by my name, Demon Lord Rimuru."

He asked me to call him with whatever preference. He didn't seem to mind at all despite being in front of all the Holy Knights, saying that it was only natural for him to act humble before me, for he saw me as an equal to his master, Demon Lord Luminas. Louis then explained the whole thing from start to finish at a volume loud enough for the Holy Knights eavesdropping on the side to hear as well.

"So, was the Demon Lord Valentine I ran into during the Walpurgis Banquet your younger brother?"

"He was. My twin brother to be more precise. But unfortunately, he was murdered after that Banquet."

There wasn't much regret in Louis's voice.

"Huh, did you just say that he was murdered?"

Although Louis didn't seem to mind, I was a bit surprised. After all, the power that Demon Lord Valentine possessed was no way equal to any average body double.

"Oh, about that. Roy was probably overconfident to the point that he lowered his guard. There are many hostile factions to the Western Holy Church, and there are even countries that consider the Holy Empire of Lubelius to be an eyesore. I figure that assassins sent by these hostile forces probably got the best of him..."

*With that being said, his death was still quite pathetic*---Louis added.

![break]

He said it without a hint of remorse, but it didn't necessarily mean Louis was completely apathetic. This Louis guy's power, which seemed to even surpass Roy's, was not to be underestimated either. Even still, he probably couldn't view the murder of his brother, who possessed the power to rival demon lords, in an optimistic light.

"Lately we were using Roy to train our new recruits in actual fieldwork. He was once careless enough that even Sare defeated him, meaning Roy was indeed slacking," Hinata concluded. "Nonetheless, we still have to keep an eye out for the person that murdered Roy. But that is of course none of your concern."

Indeed, this Roy didn't really concern me. But with this, the connection between Pope Louis, Demon Lord Valentine, and the God Luminas has been clarified for me. Not only me, but the Holy Knights listening to their explanations seemed to have figured it out as well. Everyone was stunned speechless, likely all hearing this for the first time.

Seeing that I have understood the situation, Hinata turned to face her comrades.

"All right, did you catch all that? I really had no intention to deceive you all, but I sort of did as a result---"

"H-Hinata-sama..."

She raised a hand to stop the Holy Knight and continued speaking.

"I couldn't tell you guys before since the less people who knew about this plan the better. I will have to dispose of any witnesses if the news of this leaks out," Hinata cruelly declared.

*I see. How reckless*.

"Hehehe. I, Arnaud, will not be so easily fooled. You must have been threatened by the God Luminas---no, by Demon Lord Luminas! Am I wrong?" the Holy Knight called Arnaud interjected, yet Hinata immediately shot him down.

"Not at all. Didn't I just mention? Luminas-sama protects the people; That is definitely true. It's why I made up my mind that as long as Luminas-sama remains peaceful with humans, I would obey her orders. In other words, Arnaud, I won't allow you to speak ill about Luminas-sama."

Hinata served Arnaud the ultimatum with a glare. No wonder she got misunderstood all the time. It seems that Shizu-san's concern was not unfounded.

"Ahh, don't get so worked up now. I mean, Hinata, can't you be a bit gentler with your tone? This level of explanation is not sufficient at all, is it?"

"Shouldn't this be none of your business?"

Hinata shot me a glare. *I told you to stop doing that!*

"How is it not my business? We would be very troubled if you all split up due to in-fighting here."

"Keep your hands to yourself. Basically---"

Hinata couldn't finish her objections before---

"Don't worry, we will always have faith in Hinata-sama!"

"Indeed, Arnaud has a point. Demon lord Rimuru, we don't follow the God Luminas. The Order follows Hinata-sama and Hinata-sama alone, so you don't have to worry about us splitting up due to in-fights."

Arnaud and Renard spoke from the same mind as both dismissed my concerns. Even though they might have had some reservations^[The source here uses the metaphor of "having some *wasabi* in heart" (Wasabi is the spicy thing you eat with sushi, implying some resentment)], everyone still believed in Hinata. It was a shared sentiment among the knights. It was wonderful that they still had trust in each other.

"That's fine then."

Seeing that I was on the same page, Arnaud added: "Moreover, after seeing such a sight..."

Although he was vague, I was able to guess as to what Arnaud was referring to. That sight he mentioned must be referring to the fact that Luminas and Veldora were engaging in a fierce battle just above our heads.

![break]

*Honestly, you two are giving me a headache, so please stop immediately*.

I had established a defensive network with 'Absolute Defense' from 'Covenant King Uriel' in order to prevent people on the ground from being affected. But the area was simply too wide; there was still a chance for casualties.

It wasn't hard to imagine the reason behind Arnaud's quivering voice after witnessing Luminas's intense and cruel attacks.

As in: "It's no wonder that Hinata-sama was defeated against an opponent as strong as that."

"She's indeed worthy of the title of God. If she were to become an enemy of humanity, we probably wouldn't be able to do anything..."

Compared to the conversations we had, this sight alone seemed to be far more convincing to the members of the Holy Knight Order. It was then that Louis addressed them, "Rest assured. Luminas-sama has a generous heart; her grace doesn't take joy in abusing people under her protection. As long as humans refrain from antagonizing her, a friendly relationship can surely be built. But she would indeed forbid anyone from revealing her true identity."

*Don't spread news that says the God Luminas is a demon lord,* Louis urged them firmly.

Indeed, it was all because of Veldora that Luminas's identity got exposed. I would naturally do them this favor as well. While I was willing to help, the Holy Knights...they seemed to also be willing to keep this information a secret. The reason was probably due to the fact that it was Hinata's wish as well. It seemed that their admiration of Hinata had far exceeded my expectations.

Now then, I guess there doesn't seem to be a need to worry. The way I saw it, Hinata was really cold and didn't like clarifying her words. Her personality made her very easily misunderstood---

"Hey you, are you thinking about something rude again?"

"EHH! N-no, I'm not thinking of anything---"

Could this girl actually have some sort of superpower? She read my mind like a book...

![break]

<<Negative. No such effect is detected.>>

![break]

I-is that so?

Then, her instinct is truly terrifying. I should really stop thinking about these things in front of Hinata---so I came to this realization.

![break]

Suddenly, a flying object hurtled towards the ground, striking a giant crater. That thing got up casually and ran towards me as soon as it saw me. That was of course Veldora. He snuck behind my back, staring up into the sky while using me as his shield. Above me, a silver-haired, young beauty slowly descended from the air while casting furious glares in my direction.

"R-Rimuru, go convince that stubborn guy for me fast! I've already generously apologized, yet she completely ignored me!"

![break]

*Uhhhhh, okie. But seriously, please leave me out of this.*

![break]

It was all Veldora's fault this time after all. But, come to think of it, when did Veldora ever do any good? I could only recall the many troubles he gave me after his recent revival. Just now I also witnessed how Veldora's apology method^TM^ wound up triggering Luminas even harder.

Veldora casually said to Luminas, who was about to finish him off: "GHAAHAHAHA! I didn't mean it at the time. Everyone makes mistakes during his or her youth, so be the bigger person and just forgive me already!"

Luminas was livid after hearing it.

"Hand over the lizard."

The oppressive tone of her voice sent shivers down my spine. Her glare also terrified Veldora who was hiding behind my back. Honestly, I didn't wish to become an enemy of Luminas over such a thing. Besides, I could relate to her feelings. That was not an apology at all. I think it's about time for Veldora to get some punishment and reflect for a bit one way or another.

That's why I---

"Here you go."

I grabbed Veldora's neck and without hesitation pushed him over to Luminas.

"NUUUU! I can't believe you've betrayed me, Rimuru!"

"Nah, that's no betrayal. Aren't you the sole party responsible here?"

We've got to be reasonable on this type of matter. I should distinguish right from wrong right now in order to clear any grievances that I may have with Luminas.

I handed over Veldora based on these considerations. Luminas looked at me with surprise, but she quickly turned to Veldora with a cruel smile on her lips.

"Very good. You seem to be able to grasp the situation, Demon Lord Rimuru. That's night and day when compared to this lizard."

"You're flattering me. But he has caused a lot of trouble for you this time, so you can punish him however you see fit before calming down. But I do hope you can forgive him afterwards."

"Hmm, I'll consider it."

Luminas nodded, a small smile escaping from the corner of her mouth. And just like that, I made peace with Luminas.

As Veldora shrieked: "Hold on! S-shouldn't you consider my opinion as well?!" while being dragged off, both me and Luminas pretended to have not heard a thing.

"Then I shall release all my hatred for you once and for all! 'Embrace Drain'!"

"GABABABABABA!"

It appeared as if Luminas was hugging Veldora, though not so much in a sweet couple way. Even though the two were different in build, it still could be considered as a type of bear hug. But that alone couldn't possibly hurt Veldora... ~~perhaps only endangering his virginity (Implying that Veldora isn't the biggest chad)~~

![break]

<<Answer. It is speculated that it will be draining spirit energy from the target---meaning draining magicules---while inserting sensations of 'Excruciation' and 'Sickness' into target's body. If the transmission of such nervous signals is not intercepted, it will not be affected by 'Pain Nullification' and will directly attack the 'soul'.>>

![exact fit image](image1)

Well, in other words it meant that even mister Veldora^[The actual title used for him is actually "Brother Veldora"] the Astral Lifeform would sustain this attack of 'Forced Pain'. In some sense, it was far crueler than just eliminating him directly. Veldora's magicule storage was beyond measurement, so he probably wouldn't die no matter how much spirit energy Luminas drained. But he would become exhausted afterwards. That, on top of 'Excruciation' and 'Sickness', would make the perfect combo for torture.

Luminas's attack continued for a while. Veldora cried and howled. He even stared at me with sad puppy eyes, but I ignored him with a stone-cold conscience. This would be best for Veldora as well---or rather, it was quite cheap to sacrifice Veldora to please Luminas.

This is the so-called political transaction. Forgive me, Veldora.

"---It's fine. Since Luminas-sama also seems to be enjoying it, I feel happy that she gets to cleanse her resentment of late," Louis commented flatly.

"Indeed. Right now, we are still not clear about who was responsible for killing Roy, nor do we hope that you will become our enemy... But there's something that's been bugging me, could 'He' actually be---"

Hinata agreed with Louis while turning to Veldora, asking a question out of confusion. Right, I now recall that he hasn't been formally introduced.

"That's Veldora. It's hard to tell when he's not in his dragon form, but he's definitely the real deal. Since he appears to be quite busy (getting tortured) at the moment, I'll properly introduce him to you all later."

"H-hold on, Rimuru! Please i-introduce me now---"

"Oh? So there is still breath left in you."

"WABOBOBOBO!"

Veldora's desperate attempts to escape were only met with more intense assaults from Luminas.

Poor thing.

You could have been fine if you kept your mouth shut...

![break]

"---Is this the 'Storm Dragon' that Luminas-sama has been on guard against all this time? He does give off quite an imposing aura... ~~(among other things)~~" Hinata muttered in shock.

That couldn't be helped I suppose. After all, mister Veldora was in quite the hilarious pickle now. With his majestic presence nowhere to be found, it was hard to imagine he was a Catastrophe-class monster. The rest of the Holy Knights shared the same sentiments, all with confused expressions hanging on their faces.

"I-I c-can't believe this..."

"That is the real thing? The fearsome 'Storm Dragon'---"

"You gotta be kidding me...? I kinda feel bad for him?"

There were many individuals who had already been fooled by Veldora's appearance. Due to my 'Clone'---the one that uses the young Shizu-san as a model---Veldora was arguably a handsome devil with his mouth shut. Some girls would probably fall for it when some handsome guy like him is begging with those distressed eyes.

But, don't get fooled now everyone. This guy was a spoiled, good for nothing dragon creature. If I didn't press stricter discipline on him now, it would cause trouble for us---or rather me.

![break]

<<Report. Probability of outburst of Storm Dragon Veldora's youki (demonic aura) has fallen to a safe range.>>

![break]

---Huh!

Could it be that the series of actions Luminas executed just now were all within Wisdom King Raphael's calculations? No, how could it... It shouldn't be possible. There is no way it can see that far into the future. I'm definitely overestimating it. I couldn't help but have high expectations, considering how accurate Raphael-san's predictions were during the fight with Hinata.

I shook my head in an attempt to dispel such thoughts and get back in the right frame of mind. I took a glance around and announced: "We should change the venue next. There have been a lot of misunderstandings, so let's settle down for now and discuss our future relations in detail."

And so, I decide to lead the Holy Knights into our town.

.........

......

...

Rigurd was waiting at the city entrance. It seemed like he hurried his way here after I sent Souei to inform everyone. There was still plenty of time left, but that was just Rigurd's personality. The man loved to rush to his duty.^[More accurate kanji translates to "likes to do things by running"]

"Thank you all for coming, and welcome to our city!"

Rigurd lead the Holy Knights into the city with a beaming smile. He may have learnt some new tricks from all the diplomacy lately, but that smile on his face would not lose to any professional attendant. He didn't display a single trace of hostility towards these individuals who we were just on guard against, how skillful!

"We will be preparing meals, so do tell if you have any dietary restrictions."

He had also carefully considered people that may have dietary constraints due to allergies or religion. His diligence in studying was truly admirable. He must have learnt about the human culture or mindset during his encounters with adventurers and merchants while I wasn't looking.

No one would probably believe that he was originally just some weak goblin.

"Ah, no. You don't have to be so courteous---"

Hinata looked troubled and planned to turn him down, but we still had to discuss our future plans. Before we knew it, however, night descended upon us, so we may have to move meetings to the next day. Since such an opportunity was rare, I might as well show these guests around town while they were here.

"Ah, don't be so generous. Let's leave the detailed discussion for tomorrow. Today we should hold a feast in celebration of our peaceful resolution and have some fun!"

"Oh oh, a feast! That's a wonderful idea! There will of course be wine as well, right?"

Veldora, who Luminas had just finished beating up, happily seconded my proposal. It seemed like he was fine, despite me never worrying about him in the first place.

"Hmm. If you are hosting a feast, surely you would want to invite me as well, wouldn't you?"

HMM-HUH!

Luminas snuck up on me out of nowhere. I did intend to do that, but didn't you already say you would consider sparing Veldora?

"Of course we will! Should I call you Luminas...-dono?"

"That sounds quite awkward; just call me Luminas."

She immediately approved just while I was worrying. Since we're both members of the 'Octagram', I should follow through and spare the courtesy.

"Then, Luminas, call me Rimuru as well. And about Veldora---"

"---Who I will not forgive by the way. But even if that's the case, I've only come today to clean up the mess my subordinates left behind. Rimuru, I shall judge that lizard on another day for your sake."

*Ho ho, Luminas is calling me Rimuru*. I thought she would be the arrogant type, but it turned out that she had quite the forthright personality. Now we could live in peace. Yet Veldora suddenly started to complain again, which in effect, caused Luminas to...

"What?! Haven't you done enough?!"

"Stop nagging and shut up already! I'm the one who's compromising here, okay? Or how about we fight it for real right here, right now to settle the score once and for all?!"

"GAHAHAHA! Interesting. I'll show you my power after evolution then---"

The two started to fight (again). Should I call them incompatible?

You really couldn't tell without seeing them get in a fight with each other. But if I continued to allow the two to act so recklessly, this entire town may end up destroyed.

"Idiot! You stop that right now! No fighting is allowed here."

Having realized this, I invoked my authority to mediate the fight.

Luminas seemed quite satisfied also having *drained* a large amount of magicules.

She seemed to finally be done, so let's refrain from further agitating her. If she were going to participate in our feast, I would have to treat her with the highest courtesy.

"Speaking of our feast, is it fine if we can't serve meals as luxurious as those during the Walpurgis Banquet?"

Luminas nodded to affirm my question.

"I didn't attend the feast last time because I had an ominous feeling, but that alone shouldn't be a problem preventing me from going. Chefs who work for me also served those dishes in the past, but I've already gotten tired of it since there's no need for me to eat anything. Is there any rare alcohol here? That lizard over there seems to be looking forward to it, which seems to be rubbing off on me as well now."

Luminas seemed to share a strong desire to attend the feast.

"Luminas-sama, won't you be lowering your guard doing this?"

Seeing how Luminas behaved, the old butler serving by her side spoke up. His elderly character was only limited to his appearance. His back was ramrod straight, and one could tell he was no ordinary man from his aura alone. He was at least able to stand toe to toe with Louis.

Luminas turned to the man with displeasure.

"Huh, Gunther. You are always nagging like this, so stop being such a nagger. This is why I didn't want to bring you along."

"But that is my duty..."

"Forget about it; it won't be a problem. Rimuru here seems to be quite the reasonable man as well. I'm not interested in finishing things off with Veldora at this point of time, so there's nothing to be concerned about."

"But---"

"How stubborn! Don't you even think about ordering me, an ancient demon lord, around! So be a doll and just leave," Luminas rebuked him, illustrating her aggressive nature. The elder butler named Gunther let out an exasperated sigh, but he probably couldn't defy Luminas, so he decided to obey after a momentary period of hesitation.

"---Then, I shall depart first."

Luminas lit up after hearing this.

"Hmm, thanks for the hard work, Gunther. I have Louis and Hinata here, so you are worrying too much."

"It is only natural for me to worry about your highness.^[The address used by Gunther here is actually "Princess", which may either be some foreshadowing or just a term Fuse decided to use.]"

Gunther turned to Louis.

"Then I shall leave the rest to your care, Louis."

"Understood."

Louis seemed rather troubled as well. Even though his face remained impassive, it was the vibe I got from him. Luminas probably toys around with them all day long... I couldn't help but think that way after witnessing their interactions. Gunther vanished the moment he heard Louis's response.

Now that he had left, Luminas's mood seemed to be gradually lightening as well.

"All right, that annoying fella is gone. Now I can enjoy the feast all I want!"

And so, likely coerced by Luminas's imposing aura, the Holy Knight Order was forced to join as well.

No one dared to object since none of them wished to displease Luminas. After all, her duel with Veldora just now was terrifying. Even though I was able to stop them before it escalated, things would have gotten hairy had I left it unattended. Those wearing tense expressions seemed to be very aware of this, while some still seemed to be out of the loop with the whole ordeal. I'll just leave things as they are.

It was only natural for the Holy Knights to feel confused after going through all of this. Moreover, my duel with Hinata before was also at a superhuman level. In addition to the elimination of the ex-Heroes "Seven Luminary Clerics" and the fact that the God they believed in was in fact Demon Lord Luminas... Now we had that Demon Lord Luminas battling against the Storm Dragon Veldora. While they have pledged support for Hinata and appeared calm, these things probably still took time to digest.

Anyhow, I'll let them relax for the day.

Rigurd was straight to the point as he delivered the instructions with a resounding clap. With that, the citizens on hold quickly moved into action to assist the Holy Knights. Some were in charge of tending to the horses, some were safekeeping the weapons and gear, and others were distributing healing potions to the injured.

Now that I looked at these knights, their words about trusting Hinata were no lie. Seeing that Hinata had accepted the services, the Holy Knights handed over their weapons without a moment's hesitation. Some were even gasping at the effect of the medicine, most likely after trying them out.

And here I thought there might be more quarrels, but things were surprisingly peaceful.

![soft scene break]

"Then, since there's still time before the meal is ready, how about we have everyone clean off the dust from traveling by visiting the bathhouse first? And of course, the lounges are all ready for use as well if you so desire."

The Holy Knights responded with confused expressions. They shouldn't have been strangers to the term "bathing", considering there was such a tradition in the Kingdom of Ingracia as well. There were also bathhouses in the inns where Hinata's party lodged. But these people probably didn't expect that monsters would bathe as well.

Hmph, be shocked indeed! I was very proud of this, after all, since the bathhouse in our nation was more luxurious than the royal bathhouse found in the Kingdom of Ingracia. It was more like a hot spring resort since we had everything from a large bathing area to our famed outdoor bathing pool. We had all sorts of pools like those onsen towns (streets)^[Hot spring street.]. On one hand, we get to promote ourselves, and on the other, they also got to wash away their fatigue. Moreover, their clothes were torn and stained after the intense battles, so we would be preparing replacements. It was a rare opportunity, so let's use it to advertise our nation. We had someone prepare the newly developed kimonos made from hemp. There were also yukatas for the ladies, so there were a lot of options.

"Please leave that to us. Shuna-sama is already working on it," Haruna said, beaming. It seemed like there was nothing for me to worry about. If that was the case, we had to hurry on to the next phase.

"Then, I shall invite everyone to enjoy the proud hot springs of our nation. These are hot springs led directly from their source and can cleanse your fatigue. Moreover, it is superb for skin care."

I didn't forget to do a little touting. This seemed to have piqued Luminas's curiosity as well.

"Oh, did you say hot springs? And skincare? How interesting. And as for my personal bathhouse, surely it will be the classiest room in this kingdom?"

Hmm? Personal bathhouse?

Ah, I suddenly understood what she meant. The Dwarven Kingdom, Dwargon, which possessed advanced technology, mainly used individual saunas. There weren't any bathhouses for multiple people to bathe in. There were public bathhouses in Ingracia, but none in Blumund. Since the average denizens there would use 'Utility Magic (Daily Magic)' to purify themselves, there was little need for a water bath. There were also many people around major towns that could help with casting purification at a low price. In other words, water bathing was not common in this world, limited to only large nations with many otherworlders as residents. There, the upper echelons could enjoy luxurious, personal bathing pools.

I almost forgot the fact that here in our nation, every household had an individual bathing pool. Luminas probably thought of them as some sort of private royal bath, which we happened to lack. If I lead Luminas to bathe in a pool of a regular civilian household, there was no guessing how furious she would get. For this reason, I decided to clarify the misunderstanding.

![break]

"Ahh. We have bathhouses where everyone can bathe together, with the males and females separated of course. There is also a mixed bath if you so desire; I definitely won't stop you..."

I was trying to get the idea across to Luminas first before someone else gave an unexpected response.

"---AHHH!"

"W-What did you say?!" ~~(said Arnaud, unsurprisingly)~~

"Oh uh..."

The male members of the Holy Knights such as Arnaud all turned to me with the same beam of light shining in their eyes. Hehehe, they seem to be quite the men of culture as well.

"Hmmph. If you guys are interested, just go ahead---"

I was cut short midway when I noticed the icy cold glare Hinata was giving me. No can do, but I've seen that one coming...

"Luminas-sama, let's go bathe in the female bath. I haven't taken a hot spring bath in a long time, so I'm looking forward to it."

"Oh? If Hinata says so, I have no objections either."

![break]

I see, so it couldn't be helped after all. It was quite the rare occasion for Hinata and Luminas to bathe together---hmm, hold on. It's too early to give up just yet!

Arnaud and the rest looked quite frustrated, but successfully inviting Hinata and Luminas to a mixed bath was an impossible feat.

However, if it were just me alone...

Sorry---I cast a sympathetic gaze towards the rest of my dudes before leading Hinata and the others to the location.

"Then, I'll guide you guys to the female bath."

I casually started walking. But things didn't go that smoothly. Hinata pulled the brake and said: "Wait. Why are you taking us there?"

"Why do you ask? Don't you need someone to guide you?"

*I can't panic here.*

I put on a face of calm composure and answer, feeling all righteous.

"Because none of you know the direction. Moreover, the baths are also separated based on their effects. We even have a sauna. So, considering all of that, it's best if I'm the one doing the explanations for all the details."

I even boasted about how I guided the two Beastketeers there when they expressed their interests in the bathhouse. Considering the good review I got last time, it would certainly go smoothly this time as well.

"Based on all these reasons, I wish to introduce them to you all properly so you will know their benefits."

"Rimuru-sama, you should let me do it if that's the case!" Shion spoke up. However, her interference would prove troublesome for me. *I will have to shut her down now somehow.*

"No way. Shion alone is not reliable enough."

"How come?!"

"Ahh, you (guests) don't have to be so courteous with me. I wish to join you all as well during this rare occasion," I answered as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Now, it was totally not strange for me to use the female bath.

*Hehehe, perfection, what a perfect plan. Now I can justifiably take the hot spring bath with Hinata and the others---*

"Didn't I tell you to hold on a second? Weren't you a man in the past? Why do you look so justified trying to bathe with us?"

My heart suddenly pounded heavily---I've been exposed!

Reasonably speaking, I shouldn't have any cold sweat on my back, but an icy sensation was crawling up my spine.

As Hinata pointed out the problem, Luminas also narrowed her eyes and responded with an "Oh?" sound.

"N-no, about that..."

Just as I was getting anxious, an unexpected voice suddenly came to my rescue.

"It won't matter! Rimuru-sama is just Rimuru-sama."^[Special coupon giveaway for whoever gets the reference, you are a man of culture.]

The one who backed me up was the Shion who I previously deemed unreliable. Good job keep it up! I cheered for Shion on the inside, but unfortunately Shion was Shion after all.

"Can you guide us to the bath house too?"

"Of course!"

"Then, can I ask you to take us there?"

"But..."

"Don't you think this is the chance to display how reliable you are by showing off your ability in front of your master?"

"I see!"

And just like that, Hinata was able to quickly persuade her.

"Rest assured, Shion-san. We will come along as well. You have the two of us at your side should you run into any trouble."

"Right, we've bathed there several times before, so we know it like the back of our hand," the two Beastketeers said to Shion, putting the final nail in the coffin.

"Rimuru-sama, please leave the matter to me!"

"Uh, m'kay... You go girl."

Ah, what a rare opportunity. I was hoping to enjoy the view of Hinata's beautiful, naked body... But since this is how it developed; I would have to give it up. And so I'd lost a once in a lifetime chance. As I admitted my defeat with tears in eyes, I left the matter to Shion. To comfort myself, I turned to Benimaru and the others.

"Tsk, it can't be helped then. I'll go to the male bath which I've not used for so long."

This is one of my strengths: being able to quickly cheer myself up.

"Then, how about you help scrub my back? Bathing in this hot spring is even superior to the secret water springs hidden in the mountains^[I think it is referring to a lot of Japanese hot spring (onsen) in mountain regions where they use natural (hot) spring as direct source of water supply. Supposedly these places have medicinal benefits. E.g. Hoshi Onsen.] when it comes to cleansing the sweat and weariness from your body."

"I should be of service since you need a back rub---"

The hot spring we built together was quite popular amongst Benimaru and the rest, so it would be quite nice to bathe with everyone every now and then.

"GAHAHAHA! Then Rimuru, how about you rub my back for me?"

"Why do I have to do it?!"

I didn't feel the need to respond to Veldora's feel-good words. I pretended to ignore him and moved out while leading everyone else.

![break]

The percentage of males in the Holy Knight Order was quite high, to the point of nearing almost a hundred men. But it would pose no issues for the grand bathhouse in our nation. Even though it would be crowded if they were to visit the same spot, we had several different smaller bathhouses specifically for that occasion. Everyone went to try them in separate groups. They all seemed elated at the prospect of visiting the bathhouse, so I must've astounded them with its wonders.

As I was thinking, I ran into Shuna midway through the journey.

"The clothes for changing are all prepared. By the way, Rimuru-sama, why are you walking with the male guests?"

Although the tone of her voice was incredibly gentle, there was no smile in her eyes.

"Oh, I wanted to bathe with everyone else."

I was somewhat confused (by the way she talked) but gave my answer, nonetheless. Shuna cracked up a cute smile. Eh? Why does she look mad?

"What is going on here?"

Shuna glanced around as she spoke, her gaze lingering on Benimaru and Souei.

"Rimuru-sama still has things to attend to, so he can't accompany everyone any longer. In addition, Nii-san and Souei, I have something to discuss with you two."

"Ah, no---"

"..."

Benimaru and Souei were cowed into silence under Shuna's pressure. Although they didn't know the specific reason, they deemed it inadvisable to anger her right now. As for me, I was dragged to bathe in our own private bathhouse.

*I don't get it. Why is Shuna upset?*

With that doubt in mind, I left the venue at Shuna's urging.

![soft scene break]

After a quick bath I went to check on the feast preparations.

The venue was the banquet hall. Since we'd been hosting many feasts as of late, I thought it was a good idea to have a proper venue. It was a brand-new building. The building's shape resembled a large, round dome, about the size of a gymnasium. Once you entered, the interior was wide and spacious with tatami^[A type of mat used as flooring material in traditional Japanese households] floor mats bedded all over. It could also serve as an emergency shelter if such a situation arose, since there was enough room to squeeze in quite the number of people.

Being a building with a large open space, we built it with a sturdy steel frame, though over time it was to transform into magisteel. In that regard, our country had a great advantage since we housed many majins in possession of abundant magicule.

![break]

The meals happened to be served on the dining table^[The phrase refers to a special dining table that is served separately with the dish to the table where the person is sitting. (since in traditional Japanese household they sit on the ground where there is no big dining table)] just as I was in the middle of considering this. The tables were all topped with delicate bowls only found in classy restaurants.

I sculpted and fired clay bowls during my spare time, which led to the children learning about it too. Since then, we had acquired lots of new and fine-looking works of pottery. Some were even colored by either extracting juice from medicinal plants or by mixing strange minerals into the clay to make colorful and vibrant products. The bowls used by every household were all made by the children. You never know until you try.

Even the dining tables that were being presented to us were all top-notch pieces of furniture decorated with delicate patterns. Dold handled the part that required processing wood material. The children learned alongside him and we've helped schedule labor time for them to do this as part of their entertainment. Considering all of this, it seemed that my interest for hot springs and food containers was being reflected in the products we had here.

Looking back to the time when I was still eating grass, my life today is surprisingly comfortable. I even got to taste the delicacies of food these days. I saw it was indeed true that people would work hard in order to better their life.

![break]

Today's meal was tempura^[Japanese dish of fried vegetable/seafood].

Amazing. I'm truly moved that we were able to make such food. Not only was its taste exceptional, but it was also visually appealing. It was a testament to the skills of today's Head chef, Shuna. And it goes without saying that Shion took no part in the cooking process. Anything Shion cooks will look absolutely awful to begin with. Even though she now had the Unique Skill 'Cook', we couldn't let her risk it and be responsible for everyone's food.

These tempuras were some of the dishes Shuna developed after viewing my memories. Milim also couldn't stop praising the Karaage (Japanese style fried food), hamburgers, steak, and croquettes; there was also ebi fry (fried shrimp).

As someone who wasn't well versed with the intricacies of cooking, I couldn't elaborate on the difference between ebi fry and tempura. To put it in simpler terms, "Ebi fry dips the shrimps in the coating ingredients first before frying with oil". The coating would greatly alter the taste and texture. There were also varying ways to fry them, so it was a lot harder than expected to recreate the taste and texture of the food from my vague memory alone.

Shuna endured a lot and worked hard for it. It's all thanks to her efforts that the cuisine could be recreated to this extent. There were many exquisite dishes in Ingracia too, but they unfortunately didn't have Japanese delicacies. The meal Guy prepared was also along the lines of classy Western fare, so I guessed Japanese dishes were rare in this world.

There was one reason for that---

Among the Western Nations, few were coastal, making seafood a rare commodity. It would also be quite expensive to use magic to maintain the freshness of these products. Even if there were otherworlder chefs from Japan, it'd still be difficult to make food if you didn't have the ingredients.

Speaking of which, Yoshida-san also expressed his frustration about it, saying that there were too few varieties of alcohol, chiefly wines, which made it almost impossible to recreate many different types of cake. He was ecstatic when I told him I'd prepare them for him.

Considering all this, you could understand just how blessed I was. Even with relevant knowledge, it was still an impossible feat to recreate dishes in such a short period of time. Especially Japanese ones, since gathering ingredients was already a difficult task in and of itself. I had to catch a bunch of fish in order to make things like Katsuobushi (dried tuna)^[Fishing side story refer to side story compilation, chapter 3 "Fishing"]. By using my skill to perform 'Spatial Movement', I was able to create a means to transport and maintain freshness, therefore allowing us to accommodate different types of ingredients. But I still wanted to figure out a way to transport without using skills, so it became a topic of study in the future.

Food is the essence of culture.

If the food of a nation is not sufficiently developed, then such a nation's culture would be of no significance to me. I believed that among the three pillars of life's necessities: food, clothing and shelter, food was the most important. But everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion.

Based on all these reasons, we toiled to develop all sorts of cuisines. It was far easier to get cereals like wheat, barley, and oats than I had imagined. I remembered seeing white bread in the capital of Ingracia, which was considered daily fare for the rich. By studying its production method, I was later able to produce them in my kingdom with relatively easier means.

Our current research efforts centered around white rice. We haven't improved it to the point of having satisfactory taste. Compared to the Japanese rice that had been researched and improved since time immemorial, the quality of ours was definitely inferior.

But that was only natural. I didn't expect things to go that smoothly anyways. We were able to quickly harvest by using magic to grow them. But with that being said, growing them in the winter season was no easy feat. Currently we only had a small amount growing in controlled indoor environments. It would take a long time before we could show any results.

But there may be a solution. When I asked Raphael-sensei if there was a better way, I got an immediate response. The method was to use Shion's 'Cook' to overwrite results. Since she could overwrite results, improving the quality of the product should be a piece of cake.

But will it really work?

I didn't think anyone would accept such a method since it was quite the devious way to do things... But that's just me thinking. Although at this point, it was probably already too late to be saying stuff like this. We'd used this method quite recklessly during the production of wines, so any intention of self-restraint was long gone.

Our appetite took precedence over ethics. But we couldn't rely on Shion's power during every harvest, so we needed to continue our research. However, that was excluding a small portion of---primarily for me---white rice. Shion was happy to help, so I handed the rice over to Shuna and told her to only serve it during special occasions^[The word used here is "記念日" which refers to anniversary or commemoration day, likely holiday in Tempest Federation.]. Today was one such special occasion. Demon Lord Luminas was in attendance, among other things, hence we had to splurge lavishly. In order to ensure good relations from now on, we had to demonstrate our country's value. We had both a carrot and a stick to offer. Your impression of someone will skyrocket if you get treated well despite having a negative impression in the past. If a delinquent youth were to suddenly commit a virtuous deed, his or her reputation would be greatly improved---that was my thought process at least. If we were lucky it might even make their previous impression of us turn a big one-eighty.

Even though I didn't think the Holy Knights were this shallow, it was still an effective and classic approach. With such a devious scheme in mind, I made sure the night's feast was served with only the finest delicacies. And regarding the matter concerning white rice, something I insisted on having as an ex-Japanese, but it may have been unsuited for the appetites of the Holy Knights.

Either way, Hinata would probably be pretty happy about it. After all, I was quite delighted when I got to eat the white rice that I had not seen for such a long time. As for tempura, I was pretty sure everyone would think it was delicious after eating it. The merchants and adventurers sang their praises, and it had even won over Benimaru's approval. I thought it would be fine considering the level of satisfaction it garnered so far.

The dishes had all been served and were waiting on the table while I was buried in my own thoughts. The only thing left being to wait for the Holy Knights to return from their bath.

![soft scene break]

The seats were arranged in a U shape, with three seats at the head of the table. I was seated at the center, with Veldora and Luminas to my left and right respectively. From this seat I could have everyone else in my line of sight. My own executives were sitting face to face with the Holy Knights. We intentionally arranged it this way to allow everyone to establish a friendly relationship during the feast.

The Holy Knights were led to the venue of the feast. All of them had finished bathing and were wearing either the yukatas or jinbeis (bath robe) that we had prepared for them. Reasonably speaking they should not have been used to these clothes. However, they seemed to have grown fond of them after putting them on. But that was only natural since these types of clothes would not lose to any sporty track suit in terms of comfort. Not only were they suitable for daily activities, but they also were able to serve as pajamas.

The Holy Knights nervously followed their guides to their seats. They seemed quite confused after noticing that there weren't any chairs or tables. Moreover, furniture aside, they seemed baffled just by walking barefoot on the tatami. These were simply cultural differences, so their confusion was logical.

The goblinas leading the way, on the other hand, were not nervous at all. They smoothly carried out their tasks, performing their duties spectacularly as if it were second nature. This was all thanks to Vesta's training. The Holy Knights all seemed astonished at the fact, and I could tell that they were embarrassed.

The one walking at the front was Luminas. She moved elegantly while I waited at the head seat. She was then seated next to me. Next it appeared to be Louis's turn. He looked exactly the same as Roy, who played the part of a demon lord, and gave off the regal air of a pope. The third person arriving was Hinata. As soon as she sat on her seat, she turned to me with an air of conviction.

"I sincerely apologize for the great trouble that I've caused you. Both for last time, as well as today's incident. I acted entirely on my own. I did not act upon Luminas-sama's instructions, to say nothing of my subordinates who hold no responsibility for this incident... I don't think you can forgive this transgression with just me taking responsibility alone---"

"Ahhhh, STOP!"

I hurriedly stopped Hinata just as she was about to bow and apologize to me.

*I'll disregard last time, and this time it was a misunderstanding. After all, the ones responsible were the Seven Luminaries, and Luminas has already executed them.*

![break]

I personally didn't intend to hold anyone further accountable for the problem regarding the Kingdom of Farmus, since Diablo had already dealt with it. That's why I stopped Hinata. But I'd also stumbled upon something incredible. Out of the corner of my eye, I happened to notice something...

---Two gently sloping mounds behind her revealing yukata!

They were slightly flushed and glistening after the hot bath.

I definitely didn't intentionally look at them; it could only be said to be terribly good timing. *Could this be the godly power of Wisdom King Raphael-san?*

![break]

<<Answer. No.>>

![break]

*Am I thinking too much? Also, the tone of its reply sounds so cold, but I don't really care about that type of stuff at this moment. Holy shit, my adventurous desires are flooding out non-stop. It's supposed to be time for my son to pop up, but he is unfortunately no longer with us. But you can't blame me for that.*

![exact fit image](image2)

*Because men are creatures that will never forget their adventurous spirit!!*

At times like these, it was wonderful to have a body that couldn't get a nosebleed. And by the way, bathrobe play, it's truly powerful. The destructive power of it was astounding. Freshly bathed woman in yukatas, now that's *the* best combo. Plus, the fact that it was a beauty like Hinata only added on to the terrifying effect.

I had been defeated...defeated indeed. Absolute and total defeat... With this, all was forgiven. But wait, I'd already forgiven her a long time ago!

It was at this instant that Shuna asked: "Rimuru-sama, to where might you be looking?"

She paused her serving and looked at me with a sweet smile.

*How does she do it?* Her voice was gentle indeed, yet it sent shivers down my spine.

"Nothing! I-I'm not looking at anything in particular," I hurriedly try to cover myself. "By the way, Hinata... As long as the misunderstanding is resolved, it's fine. At least, if you could give up your prejudice towards monsters, that would be great."

Hinata showed a momentary expression of hesitation before wordlessly nodding. Well in reality, that would actually be quite difficult. Being a monster was no different from being a dangerous convict holding a gun. It would be counterproductive if the public were to briefly believe that monsters were harmless, only to end up getting harmed by said monsters. We may have indeed been able to communicate with humans, but there was no guarantee that we could understand each other. Yet in this city, such a fantasy was made reality. Because the monsters all had faith in my words, they wished to be friendly and coexist with humans.

![break]

That said however, Shion and the Yomigaeri were once killed by humans.

"About that, I understand it's difficult to give out trust so easily since there's no way to know what your opponents are thinking. That, and the fact that when you consider that some monsters can be extremely cunning, only makes it harder. The guardians of mankind cannot afford to be so easily fooled by monsters."

"---You are right. Communication is the first step to understanding, but it is also a dangerous transaction. You risk the danger of being mind-controlled and having your soul bound."

I think the "soul bound" refers to being forced into some contract like how the Rosso controls all the otherworlders or how Clayman controlled Adalmann.

"Indeed. That's why it's enough for us if you believe that not all monsters are bad. If you ever encounter any suspicious monsters that you have reservations for, just leave them in our custody. It'll be all right for them to come to this town even if they're not accepted in human societies."

This was probably where we would find common ground. Our town would take in questionable monsters since the residents here wouldn't get shocked at unexpected situations that easily. But that was under the condition that those monsters could actually be communicated with.

"I understand. It won't be easy to change everyone's mind immediately, but I will ban the rule that allows people to deem monsters as evil and execute them without due process. Is that okay, Luminas-sama?"

"It's but a minor matter, so do whatever you please. But don't raise anyone's suspicion towards his or her faith in me."

"Understood. I'll have it as the number one priority for everyone to keep in mind."

Luminas seemed to also have accepted it. The Holy Empire of Lubelius was a kingdom built on the peoples' faith in the god Luminas, that was why doubts from the public would shake the foundation of the nation. The Western Holy Church was, after all, a religion with significant influence on the Western Nations, so it would only be natural for Hinata to proceed with caution.

I, on the other hand, believed that Luminas underestimated her own influence. Even though she had said that such a thing mustn't be tolerated, she didn't look like she cared at all. Perhaps it wasn't Luminas's own wish to be worshipped by others as God. Or it could've just been me overthinking it. But she did seem to have given all the authority to Pope Louis and left the chores for Hinata. The incident before was the same. It was simply due to the devious scheming of the Seven Luminaries.

Hmm, but it shouldn't be like that.

This ancient demon lord suddenly returned after leaving the spotlight for centuries just to rule once more with the figure of a majestic overlord, yet she actually disliked troubling herself---there was no way someone like that existed. "I'll be the king while giving the power to the people."---my thoughts naturally gravitated towards this direction, it was quite similar to the goal I had in mind. But I couldn't ask the question so openly in public, thus I just kept these thoughts to myself.

As I was still mulling this over, Hinata turned towards my subordinates.

"I need to apologize to you all as well. I promise you that we will not be hostile towards others simply for the fact that they are monsters," finishing with a deep bow. Seeing that Hinata had made a move, the rest of the Holy Knights quickly followed suit. "We're sorry!", all of them bowed their heads and apologized.

"Don't mind it at all. If it weren't for Rimuru-sama's orders, we too would continue to treat humans as our enemies, after all."

The one who spoke was Rigurd. He said that it was because of my orders that they were able to abandon their prejudice. For the goblins who were desperately struggling just to survive, all other races except for themselves would probably have been considered enemies...

"Personally speaking, I'm fine as long as you aren't hostile towards us. I saw your fight with Rimuru-sama, and even as I am now, I'm unlikely to win," Benimaru said, smiling. He was still his same warmongering self with his head filled with nothing but combat. I wasn't sure whether Souei agreed with Benimaru or not; he simply nodded in response. There was a tendency amongst monsters for the strong to prey on the weak, so even if enemies killed them the fault would invariably fall on the weaker creatures. Souei seemed to be of the same mind and held no grudges against the Holy Knights.

As for Shion, she was behaving rather suspiciously, as if Hinata's apology only agitated her.

"Shion, you should forgive them too. I understand your pain and anger, but not all humans are evil. There are bad humans and there are good humans; that's just how it is. It's the same for monsters, and just like with monsters, you have to ascertain their nature accordingly. Moreover, humans are creatures that can overcome their mistakes. So, aren't we the same just like them? Isn't it the character of one's soul that's most important?"

![break]

*Humans and monsters should not be differentiated by their races. The nature of an individual's soul is the most important factor.*

![break]

I hoped Shion could understand this too. I said that to her with it in mind, yet Shion seemed to be further confused. To her, all humans must've been evil. But I hoped she wouldn't treat everyone the same way. Right now Shion was still obeying my command, but I wasn't sure whether the bottled-up discontent would burst out one day.

*That must never happen. I hope she isn't just mindlessly following orders, but able to act based on her own thoughts.*

At least that's what I initially thought, which was apparently just me being paranoid. In an instant, Shion abandoned all her reservations. Thinking wasn't her strong suit anyway; speaking with an open mind was more her style.

"I understand now! I'll learn from Rimuru-sama to judge good from bad based on their 'souls'!" Shion beamed, a fierce conviction written on her face. This may have been an indication that she had overcome a major obstacle. Even though I couldn't see people's 'souls', it was good that Shion was able to open up.

The members of the Yomigaeri seemed to resonate with her, determined to think for themselves (in judging the nature of man) while abandoning their grudges against the Holy Knights.

*What a bunch. These are all companions that I'm proud of*. Being able to accept others' apologies and let go of past enmities wasn't easy. It was hard to determine to what extent they forgave the knights, but the two parties successfully made peace. As long as we were communicating, we would be able to accept each other. And just like that, we were able to reconcile on the matter.

![soft scene break]

Right, it would've been way too boring to continue with this solemn atmosphere, and it would've been a waste if these fine dishes got cold along with it. Most importantly, if this continued, there wouldn't be a chance for Veldora to show up again. He'd throw a tantrum and things would get dicey.

Supposedly, he shouldn't need to eat food, just like me. But for some odd reason, he became quite obsessed with it ever since his revival. It was a known fact that he loved desserts such as cakes. He was also quite the picky eater. No idea if he knew what he was talking about or not. It seemed like he was looking forward to enjoying this free meal, so I should probably get this feast started as soon as possible.

*Since that's the case, let's raise our cups.*

"Now then, let us raise our cups for the courageous battles fought by everyone here, cheers!"

I came up with a random toast and started the feast. It felt best to drink a cold beverage right after a bath. And of course, I'd prepared that all beforehand. We were generously offering the secret wines produced in our nation en masse.

Absolutely flawless.

Wine was the mainstream drink, even in the kingdom of Ingracia. There was also beer, but it didn't taste that good. Should I describe it as lacking in foam or carbonic acid? It was quite warm, so perhaps that was the main reason why the taste was underwhelming.

But when it came to my nation, none of these were an issue. Don't underestimate my enthusiasm for food. I researched day and night and had now developed more varieties than during the time I visited Dwargon. And the minute I mentioned that I wanted something, people would immediately start researching ways to make it. My current living environment was ideal to the point of being frightening. *Could it really be because I've become a demon lord? No, it seemed to be the same before that too...*

Ah, never mind.

So this is basically how things were. My diet had come to resemble what I had during the time I lived in Japan thanks to the hard work of my dear monster friends. My nation's food was truly delicious.

The Holy Knights would definitely be satisfied.

![break]

And my predictions were accurate.

The female waitresses are all running around to refill wine for everyone. They became quite adept due to the experience of holding the many feasts in the past. The eyes of the Holy Knights widened in surprise once they took their first sip. And as the food entered their mouth, they froze on the spot. They stole glances at their neighbor to see each other's expressions, seemingly moved by the delicious taste of the food.

I chuckled to myself. I was finally relieved seeing that they were enjoying the meal.

The main dish was tempura, but we'd also prepared some seafood. We were even serving the chopped-up sashimi^[Raw fish cutlet, basically thicc nigiri without the rice] on the tables. I got ahold of ingredients akin to soybeans and was successful in recreating soy sauce. This was one of the many fruits of Shuna's labor. It wasn't a perfect imitation of real soy sauce, but only people who were already familiar with the taste could tell the difference. For a first-time diner, this bootleg soy sauce was just as good as the real deal. Since there were different types of soy sauce as well, there may actually have been one with similar taste to ours in Japan. All in all, I was delighted with the fine quality of our product.

Sashimi was Hakurou's specialty. Even though Hakurou was not present at the moment, several other chefs had also inherited his skill. Therefore, it seemed that the training of chefs had gone smoothly as well. These chefs were able to flaunt their skills in a variety of exquisite dishes and served them one by one. Even though we went for a Japanese style cuisine, most people still enjoyed eating it. Especially Hinata, she appeared to be deeply moved as she ate her meal in silence. Unlike the knights who were not used to using chopsticks, Hinata was able to deftly maneuver them to eat her meal. She turned her attention to me, seemingly suspecting that I was looking at her.

"I mean, aren't you going a bit overboard with all this?"

"How is it going overboard?"

And I thought she was going to praise me, but I got teased instead.

I retorted as my anger quietly bubbled. And soon after, Hinata began to shower me with all of her doubts as if she were venting all of her discontent accumulated over time.

"It's the same on the road to here! Inns serving ramen and dumplings, drinking areas with free water, grand bathhouses in the middle of nowhere, and now this! Why is there fresh sashimi when you are living in a giant forest?! I've already tried very hard to accept this sansai (mountain vegetables) tempura, but this sashimi is suspicious no matter how you look at it!"

Hinata no longer had her calm composure as she finished her sentence in one breath.

Ahh, okie. I didn't expect that she would ask about that.

"Because I wanted to eat---"

"Whaaaat?"

"I mean, that's... Because I wanted to eat those foods, so I put in the effort to recreate them. And about the sashimi, we did a bit of fishing because the Beast Kingdom Eurazania, who we're on good terms with, happens to face the sea. But right now we haven't figured out a logistics network for transporting cold-storage products, that's why we are using skills to resolve the issue for now. I mean, I want to live luxuriously sometimes too!"

"Did you say skill?"

I nodded and replied with a "Hmm".

About that, I utilized the transportation channel of the orcs through Geld's 'Stomach' from his Unique Skill 'Gourmet'. Transportation magic was usually unable to move food ingredients. However, Geld's skills were an exception.

With that being said, we'd only prepared enough for this one feast. The orcs couldn't be distracted from their construction projects simply because of my stubbornness. It was thanks to the people on vacation in the village who were willing to help that we were able to get the food this time. This was the limitation of using personal skills to conduct transportation. I would have to make this a research subject and improve beyond that.

Hinata was baffled as she listened to my explanation, not saying a word.

"---I see, so skills can allow for the transportation of objects without changing their quality. And since there are many people in this nation that can use that skill... It's unbelievable how justified you seem utilizing skills of the public for personal exploit," Hinata muttered, somewhat exasperated.

*How rude!* But it was fine, I didn't plan to argue with her.

Hinata showed an expression of revelation, yet I remained unaware that an issue existed in the first place. Wasn't it only natural to make use of whatever could be used?

"It doesn't matter really, Hinata. No matter what the cause was, the fact of the matter is that all of these are delicious. Or at least, I like them quite a lot."

Luminas apparently overheard the conversation and chimed in, ostensibly drunk with a wine glass in her hand. These dishes were probably all new to Luminas, and she appeared to be greatly enjoying her tempura. She was even using her fingers to eat them, yet for some reason, Luminas looked elegant no matter how she behaved. Basically it was the correct way of dining, so it was fine as long as it didn't repulse other people. It was perhaps the hardest question we needed to resolve when it came to accommodating people who had never even seen chopsticks before. Benimaru and the rest already knew how to use chopsticks. Furthermore, the monsters in our kingdom learnt it themselves after they observed how we ate. But it was not the same case for merchants or adventurers coming from other nations. Moreover, we wished to make our nation an attraction for foreign nobilities, so we didn't want them to feel obligated to use chopsticks.

Coming from that point of view, Luminas presented a case worthy of consideration. She was using either knives, forks, chopsticks, or her fingers. The hotter dishes required chopsticks, but the rest could be eaten bare handed just fine. The methods of consumption varied depending on the dish.

It would be meaningless if the guests didn't enjoy eating, so they shouldn't be restricted to just one way. It would be better to inform them of the different possible ways to dine and wait for them to slowly adapt.

![break]

With that in mind, I asked Luminas: "Is our food suited for your appetite?"

"Hmm, I like it a lot. Delectable dishes, and even better wines."

I didn't notice that she'd been ferociously gulping down wine until after she mentioned it. Milim was a voracious eater while Luminas was an impressive drinker^[The phrase here is "酒豪" which is to describe someone with incredible drinking ability (in somewhat of a heroic sense)]. While using tempura as her appetizer, she drank a round of all the wines on the table.

"That's wonderful. But it will be bad for your body if you don't restrain yourself!"

"Silly, even poison has no effect on me, so how could I lose to mere alcohol? I had to however, go out of my way to lower the effect of 'Poison Nullification' just to get drunk!"

My advice to Luminas was apparently meaningless. *But did she just mention something about lowering the effect of 'Poison Nullification'?*

"I-is that even possible?"

"You don't say? Stop talking silly there---"

I asked Luminas, who was looking down on me, to teach me the method.

![break]

<<...>>

![break]

Wisdom King Raphael-san seemed to have some issue with that. But I didn't care, so I did as what Luminas taught and lowered my 'Resistance'. A sudden sense of drunkenness hit me the moment I did that.

Here it comes, here it comes!

Here we go! That's the feeling of getting drunk!

"GAHAHAHA! Rimuru, how come you don't know how to do such a simple trick? I've already mastered that low level of trickery!"

Mister Veldora^[The title Rimuru uses for him is "-san" but I think it's somewhat in a joking tone, so may use "mister" to show some sense of sarcasm.] looked quite proud. I had no idea when he practiced it, but right now he became a complete drunkard.

"Right, then let's drink some more!"

"Hmm. I'll drink with you then."

"You two are helpless. In that case, I shall accompany you as well."

Luminas got on board arrogantly, making the feast even more lively.

"Geez, Rimuru-sama," Shuna said, somewhat vexed, but she continued to refill my drink with a pasted-on smile. And like that we began to booze up without a hint of courtesy.

![break]

There were a rich variety of alcohols, our supply of ice was more than sufficient, and there were also refreshing beverages available^[The source just says water here, but it may be referring to "beverages"]. And of course, we had also prepared tea and juice for those who weren't adept at holding their liquor.

Haruna-san and Louis helped to refill for Veldora and Luminas, respectively. As for Benimaru, Shion and Souei, as well as the two Beastketeers and Holy Knight Elites such as Arnaud, they seemed to be competing in some sort of drinking game. The members of the Holy Knight Order started off all serious looking, but they began to loosen up after their captains chugged down a couple rounds. Some chatted with Rigurd, while others made requests to the serving ladies for more food. Among them, some even appeared to be interested in monsters' diet and wished to try the food themselves.

![break]

*Isn't that guy called Fritz? I remember he is a captain of the Holy Knight Order just like Arnaud and that he is one of the Ten Great Saints. Hmm hmm, he seems to be more impressive than I thought. The first step to understanding others is to take an interest in the food they eat. What a truly wonderful thing to do.*

![break]

However, I recalled that bit of food there to be---

My drunken mind began to race.

That over there was black rice. We took samples of graminess plants and used magicule fluid---the highly concentrated liquid magicule formed in the sealed cave---to grow them. I did the experiment out of sudden curiosity and as a result made black rice that looked like it had been blended with squid ink. In my established view, rice was just white rice, so black rice didn't look particularly appetizing. But its actual taste was without a doubt delicious. It even possessed incredibly high nutritional value, and so I added it to the production line with the name "Magic Black Rice"^[In WN, this is called "Demon Rice" due to the name it used as "魔物米" (Monster rice), here in LN however, it is called "魔黑米" (Magic black rice). So we will be using the LN name for future iteration, though we can use a better phrase than Magic Black Rice.]. It became the main fare in our nation, though I sort of remembered a huge issue it had---

"AHHH, STOP! That thing is poisonous to humans!" I shouted, suddenly sober. But Fritz's exclamation drowned me out.

"T-this thing can restore mana!"

I couldn't stop Fritz from taking a bite. Instead of being poisoned, this was how he reacted.

"Oi, forget that! Is your body okay? Feeling anything wrong?"

Bodies of weaker individuals would be affected after ingesting large amounts of magicules. The magicule content in this magic black rice was exceptionally high, so it would be the equivalent of poison for people of lesser abilities. But if ingested at an appropriate quantity, it could be used as both medicine and serve as a main dish. It shouldn't be an issue for everyone else, but whether or not it would be safe for human consumption was anyone's guess. We couldn't be so hasty with human experiments. However, judging from Fritz's reaction, the result was different from how I imagined. I previously thought that the rice would be poison to humans, but could it actually be converted to medicine for people possessing a certain amount of mana?

![break]

<<Answer. Mana restoration effect confirmed on individual "Fritz". If target possesses 'Resistance' against magicules, mana will likely be converted to energy.>>

![break]

I see, so that's how it is.

It must've been because he gave his all in the battle and rapidly depleted his mana that the effect of the food seemed so pronounced.

I snapped back to reality as the other Holy Knights began to discuss the magic black rice as well. None of them seemed at all frightened. *Getting drunk sure is terrifying.*

It couldn't be helped then; we had to prepare the portion for all of them as well. Hinata probably felt the same way I had about the rice; she grimaced upon seeing its black color... But she wasn't complaining, instead she chewed on the chazuke (tea/soup-soaked rice) made of the magic black rice. As for those who still weren't satisfied with chazuke alone, we had also prepared onigiri (rice ball). It also seemed to be getting great reviews as more servings were ordered almost in the blink of an eye. I didn't expect the magic black rice to be more popular than the white rice we specifically went out of the way to prepare for me. With that being said, it seemed like I was the only one who had a problem with its aesthetics. In reality it tasted wonderful. It was probably easier to accept for people who had never seen rice before. And because of that I found an unexpected effect of magic black rice.

![break]

I was also looking forward to the promotion our nation would get as our guests enjoyed the food and beverages. Moreover, the important thing was that this feast would be an opportunity to communicate, as I saw monsters and Holy Knights chatting with each other. Shion even arm wrestled three Holy Knights. Apparently, she achieved overwhelming victory, though the Holy Knights seemed to react with laughter at the fact.

What a nice outcome, much better than my expectations. Perhaps it was thanks to the alcohol, but if this could become a natural sight, we could probably get along with each other much sooner.

To good food and good life.

In order to reach that goal, I had to strive to do my job well. It would be my duty in the future to protect these precious moments. I made up my mind at that instant. Yet as soon as I did---

"What are you doing, Rimuru! Come, let me help you refill, let's get hammered today!"

"Most true indeed! I've come just to accompany you two. So let's drink to our hearts' content!"

"H-hold on, Veldora... And Luminas, aren't you a vampire? Why do you even need to eat and drink and how did you end up so drunk---"

"Hmph, you're such a tool! Once I became an advanced species (higher vampire), I could replenish energy from normal food. But that's irrelevant, finish your wine already!"

I told her that they were two separate things, but she was completely ignoring me. I was getting crossfire from these two drunkards, and the determination that I finally made flew straight out the window.

"Hey, you two!"

I wasn't quick enough to stop them before my glass was refilled with the distilled wine made from magic black rice and forced to down it in one go. Hinata slanted her cold eyes at us, seemingly muttering "There should be a limit to all this monkeying around." However, there was a tiny smile curled along the corners of her lips, but that might just have been my drunken delusions.

Hinata's smile looked pretty cute too---but let's keep that a secret.

![soft scene break]

And just like that, it was tomorrow already. My head hurt like hell.

![break]

<<Answer. Of course. It is the side-effect of forceful reduction of 'Resistance'.>>

![break]

*Thank you for your calm sarcasm.*

Speaking of Raphael-sensei's tone, it still sounded quite pissed. No, I must've been thinking too much. There was no way in the world that I would get scolded by my own skill. As such, I shook it off and carried about as normal.

There was an important meeting today. The future relations between the Tempest Federation and the Holy Empire of Lubelius would depend on it. I hoped that we would reach a conclusion afterwards. The venue changed to the usual large meeting room. I took my seat while struggling to endure the headache.

In reality, with the circumstances at hand, not only were we about to become enemies of the Western Holy Church, we may even have potentially opened hostilities with the Holy Empire of Lubelius. It was also a fact that the Pope's Ministry gave permission for the Templar Knight Order to mobilize, and it could have caused major damage to our nation. Given that this was the case, we had to exercise caution when dealing with them.

With that being said however, the real culprits in the Kingdom of Farmus had been executed. As for the Templar Knight Order who aided them, there was not even one survivor remaining.

But the ministry should take responsibility as well since they weren't entirely unrelated... However, I'd already accepted Hinata's apology. Moreover, the culprits responsible for the incident had already been taken care of.

Unlike Farmus, I didn't intend to fight against the Holy Empire of Lubelius. It was meaningless to ask them for reparations as long as a friendly relationship could be formed. The monetary part was compensated with Clayman's inheritance and the reparations from Farmus. And if we were to take any land, it would be too far away geographically anyways. It would've been difficult to manage, plus having such a distant land to rule would give me another headache. They already admitted their faults, so rather than demanding reparations, we decided to try together to build a friendly relationship in the future. And that was honestly my wish. I contemplated the matter as I awaited Luminas and the rest.

Representing Tempest Federation, there was me, Shion, Rigurd, and Benimaru as well as the officers in charge of the judicial, legislative, and executive branches---the three chiefs Rugurd, Regurd and Rogurd. Veldora was here as well, but we could just ignore him. Getting through to him when he was reading his manga was simply an impossible feat.

![break]

On the Holy Empire of Lubelius's side, the participants were Luminas, Louis, and Hinata. In addition, there were also the five captains. I invited them to introduce themselves.

We have the vice-commander of the order, Renard, known as Childe of 'Light'. There's also the person that is said to be the strongest knight next to Hinata, Arnaud of 'Air'. As well as Bacchus of 'Earth', Ritase of 'Water', and Fritz of 'Wind'.

Now that everyone was present, we sat face to face and commenced the meeting. First, we needed to clear out the misunderstanding. Given this was the case, we began listing out the circumstances of both parties to have some context. We would be exchanging this information upon the start of the meeting.

We checked on these things while confirming progress with their party. There was no point in voicing our complaints; right now we were only trying to verify the facts. It was best to rectify any information that appeared different from our understanding, to which Hinata also agreed.

The testimonies of both of our parties were mostly expected. It seemed that we wouldn't have to do too much explaining. Everything began ~~when the fire nation attacked~~ with the invasion of the Kingdom of Farmus. We maintained our stance and would only change our terms based on the attitude of our negotiating party.

As for how things went down on the Western Holy Church side, Hinata mentioned that there had already been a problem before Farmus made their request. To put it simply, it would be defying the doctrines of Luminism to acknowledge the existence of a monster kingdom. It was an urgent matter that may have generated distrust among the believers. If left unattended, the followers might even renounce their faith. It might even end up causing the downfall of the influence of the Western Holy Church. That was why the monster kingdom must be eliminated. For this reason, they needed a reason to justify invading my kingdom---that's how Hinata put it.

"It was under those circumstances that Archbishop Reyhiem stationed at Farmus made the request. Nicolaus thus gave the permission. I didn't have an objection at the time, and more importantly, I couldn't forgive you then---" Hinata recounted.

Farmus, while trying to protect its national interest, grew greedy for profits and intended to eliminate us for that cause. At the same time, Hinata also wished to seek revenge.

"Was it because of Shizu-san?"

"Yes, that was the case. Now that I think about it, I seem to have been manipulated as well. Although I still have no idea who was behind all this, the eastern merchants must have had something to do with it."

"Merchants... Is that so? That's gotta be the reason. There were merchants going in and out on Demon Lord Clayman's side as well. Moreover, although Geld and his men are currently under my command, in the past they were all fully geared. I suspected that they may have had ties with some other countries, and as it turned out their trading partners were the eastern Merchants."

I nodded as I came to the realization. There were a large number of business transaction records in the ledger I asked Shuna to investigate. The Eastern Empire produced most of the merchandise that Dwargon originally exported. The Empire was undoubtedly doing business with Dwargon, yet the problem lay with the identity of its broker. There wasn't any form of record.

Shuna had done a thorough investigation yet was still unable to find out the real identity of their trade partner. We even interrogated the captives to no avail. Demon Lord Clayman was extremely cautious and ordered his subordinates to be meticulous with their work, not leaving behind any evidence. This was especially true for his associates in the Moderate Clown Troupe as there wasn't any record on them either.

However, on the matter of who the trade partner was, there were still ways to determine the identity of the person. There was a vast array of artworks and rare magic items stored in Clayman's castle that were collected from all over the world. Yet most of his weapons and gear came from the Empire. Because of teleportation magic, there wouldn't be an issue with transportation no matter where he purchased them. Yet he specifically imported their goods from the Empire, meaning the two must've been somehow connected. Even though this could only count as indirect evidence, it was a decisive piece to victory.

In addition, the same logic applied to the food ingredients. There was an abundance of fruit, bread, and dairy products as well as other consumable goods^[The term here is "嗜好品" which is a general phrase referring to goods that give a person sensational stimulus. This can range from food, drinks to cigarettes.]---A large amount of food ingredients were stored in Clayman's base. These goods couldn't be teleported through magic alone and had to rely on physical transportation.

Clayman's territory before his death was the Puppet Nation of Jistav. They seemed to conduct agricultural work with slavery, yet the agricultural products did not match up with the food items found in their storage. According to Shuna's investigation, there were several food items that must have required exports from other nations. If that were the case, the prime suspect would be the neighboring Eastern Empire. Since Milim was self-sufficient in her land, she wouldn't even have had the thought of trading with others. Furthermore, neither Milim nor ex-Demon Lord Karion had the money to trade such goods with others. That was another reason why I suspected that the people who colluded with Demon Lord Clayman were from the Eastern Empire.

"That's right. They were the ones that told me that you had murdered Shizue-san. They also mentioned that you happened to be in Ingracia at the time. That was why I had moved out in hopes of eliminating you."

"Indeed. The timing then was horrible, even now looking back at it just pisses me off---"

My words visibly shook Hinata. Not only Hinata, but also Arnaud and the rest of the Holy Knights were cowed.

"Quit intimidating them now. Your 'Demon Lord Haki (Imposing Aura)' is leaking out because of your anger, you rookie."

*Oops, my bad, my bad.*

I only realized after Luminas pointed out that my youki (Demonic Aura) seemed to be leaking out. I only recently learned how to perfectly control it, but I still couldn't suppress it entirely when I got agitated.

I immediately apologized and continued.

"Anyhow, in reality, it was the eastern merchant or something who was behind this. So, do you know his name?"

"That person called himself Darm. But it must have been an alias."

An alias? I guess it made sense. But the name didn't matter here. The important thing is the fact that the eastern merchant was the real culprit.

"Demon Lord Clayman also had ties with the eastern merchant. Moreover, it was probably the same party of people that instigated the ex-king of Farmus, Edmalis."

"That was indeed the case. We were able to clarify that after interrogating Reyhiem."

I nodded with a "Hmm" and began to connect the dots.

"Demon Lord Clayman must have secretly manipulated the Kingdom of Farmus. The two factions are not in a partner relationship; it felt more like the temporary collaboration between enemies."

"And the people doing the matchmaking were those eastern merchants?"

As I was speaking, Benimaru opened up with a sudden realization. And for Hinata, she muttered to herself, "And I was also used by others for this plan---" while emitting a dangerous aura.

![break]

Next, we needed to find out who the mastermind behind all this was, however...

"All of the incidents are linked to the eastern merchant, so based off of that, it doesn't seem like things played out this way simply because the factions' interests just so happened to align. Clayman always wanted to awaken and become a True Demon Lord while the Kingdom of Farmus had its sights set on territorial expansion, which is why they intended to take our kingdom. Moreover, there is 'That Lord'^[Just to clarify, the phrase in the original source can be understood as "That person", but for consistency in Volume 6 where I translated Clayman to address this person as "That Lord", I'll continue to use this title.] who is pulling the strings..."

"'That Lord', it was the person Clayman mentioned, wasn't it?"

Luminas and I nodded to each other.

"What does that mean?"

Benimaru and the rest knew about this, but it was new information for Hinata and her party. For that reason, I gave a quick explanation.

"In truth, Demon Lord Clayman seemed to have been following the orders of someone else."

"It was quite impressive for a nobody like Clayman to have not revealed the person's true identity even to the very end."

"Is that so..."

"Could it be, that the person's true identity is one of the Seven Luminaries?"

I got the sudden inspiration as if god had enlightened me. It was just supposed to be a random guess, yet it surprisingly retained some realism.

"What did you say? You brat, are you suggesting that the Seven Luminaries acted on their own behind my back?" Luminas glared at me, clearly displeased.

Even though she personally eliminated the Seven Luminaries, it must've felt bad to have someone raise doubts about her old subordinates. I understood her feelings, and just as I was going to apologize---

"I see, we can't really exclude such a possibility" --- Louis, Luminas's trusted servant, said. I didn't actually think he would acknowledge my point.

"Louis, now even you are jesting like him---" Luminas shifted her icy glare to Louis. However, Louis was unshaken and decided to continue.

"Please hear me out, Luminas-sama. Those Seven Luminaries wanted to win your deep affection once more. Surely you were also aware of something as natural as this?"

"What do you mean by that?"

"Your deep affection---in other words, the kiss of love (love energy). The last time Luminas-sama did the ritual for them was a hundred years ago. Yet in the beginning you would have done the ritual every week. The interval had only gotten longer over time. Have you not noticed that?"

Luminas scowls after Louis pointed that out.

"I see how it is now. Us immortals do tend to forget that they were originally humans. Even though they wouldn't die without my spirit energy, they would definitely age."

"Indeed, they would. That's why they were striving to stop the aging and hoped that Luminas-sama wouldn't lay eyes on other 'Adored Individuals'---" Louis continued in a rather flat tone.

Apparently the Seven Luminaries were once humans that won Luminas's special affection. Human lives however are limited of course, that was why there existed such a ritual to overwrite this fact---the kiss of love from Luminas.

"---That's why those people probably came up with the plan to win Luminas-sama's heart again. If they had collaborated with the eastern merchant while colluding with Demon Lord Clayman in the dark, it would not be strange at all. Speaking of those bunch, especially 'Master of Sun' Gran, his ability would not lose to mere Clayman," Louis concluded.

I only mentioned it due to a stray thought, yet somehow it managed to connect the dots. Even I was astounded. How terrifying. *The pure, boundless wisdom just radiating from my body is truly formidable.*

![break]

<<...>>

![break]

Wisdom King Raphael-sensei seemed to want to say something, but I was probably just overthinking it. It may just have been jealous of my talent. It probably felt it didn't have the chance to shine since I never asked it any questions.

"Could the Seven Luminaries really have considered me as an obstacle due to such reasons?" Hinata asked, bewildered.

"Perhaps. They may have wanted to help Clayman awaken and fight you. It was impossible at least for them alone to emerge victorious against you. Thus, it is highly likely they chose to resort to any possible means in order to defeat you."

Uh---but there was no way you couldn't reach a conclusion from there.

First, they would have Clayman defeat Hinata. Then they would consider either eliminating Clayman or manipulating him as a puppet. It wasn't clear what they were planning, but Clayman's loyalty was most definitely true. If he could defeat Hinata, it would've been up to the Seven Luminaries to attend to whatever they wished to do. They could have the Kingdom of Farmus eliminate us in order to consolidate the doctrines of Luminism. And of course, they would reap a portion of the profits gained from doing so.

Once a powerful nation, like Farmus, mobilized, the eastern merchants could sell their goods such as weapons, gear, and food at a high price. And the Seven Luminaries would be able to bask in Luminas's affection once more. It definitely wasn't good to draw conclusions like this, but it was certainly one worthy of consideration.

"Did they also send me to provoke Rimuru in order to get rid of me? It seems they tried to kill two birds with one stone considering it would be abiding by the doctrines of Luminism by doing that," Hinata continued, based on Louis's theory.

But during my first encounter with Hinata, she was too strong, so I ended up fleeing. While we were on this topic, something suddenly sprang to mind.

"About that, are the Seven Luminaries really the culprits behind all this?"

Renard, who was sitting adjacent to Hinata, answered, "That's definitely the case; it was none other than the Seven Luminaries who acquainted us with those merchants," so he said.

If that was the case, there was even more evidence stacked against the Seven Luminaries. Since heroes recommended them, nobody suspected a thing, which is why everyone danced along to their tune. Honestly, I didn't think the Seven Luminaries would have thought that far ahead during my first battle with Hinata. Yet they did intend for me to kill Hinata this time. It was quite troubling to deal with people that cunning, but there shouldn't be any worries now that they'd all been eliminated---

"Wait, hold on. If they are called Seven Luminaries, wouldn't it mean there are seven people in total? Doesn't that leave one surviving member?"

This completely flew over my head given how Hinata and the rest seemed so laid back, yet upon careful consideration I realized things were not quite over. The sole survivor must also have been related to this whole incident. I couldn't help but panic.

"Hehe, you don't have to worry about that," Hinata replied with a scoff. "Nicolaus, who remained at the home nation, has informed me that the last person has been taken care of as well. He also mentioned that he had found out that the crystal ball with your message was tampered with. He seemed to have used it as evidence to condemn and execute that remaining person."

A frigid smile curled on Hinata's lips. Even though I was just watching from the side, her expression was quite frightening. She radiated the air of a beauty who was contemplating something devious. *I suppose that's one of the reasons why Hinata is often misunderstood. Let's put that on hold for now.*

"Hold on a second. Who exactly is this last person?"

It may have just been my guess, but was he that 'Master of Sun' Gran who was apparently stronger than Clayman? If that was true, this man called Nicolaus was not to be underestimated either...

"It should be the head of the Seven Luminaries, 'Master of Sun' Gran. That man seldom went on the offense, so he was probably the one remaining."

"Really? He actually managed to beat that Granbell. By the way, isn't Nicolaus the cardinal who pledged his life-long loyalty to you? What method did he use?"

"It's nothing to brag about, but he seemed to have prepared 'Disintegration' beforehand. He caught Gran off guard by casting the shot on him unexpectedly and took care of him."

"I see how it was... Granbell had gotten old to have fallen for a lowly trick like that..." Luminas muttered lightly with a gentle sigh.

![break]

But this news brought me no joy. My wish had fallen flat now that there was one more dangerous man out there. With that being said, he seemed to have gotten the better of his enemy by surprise, so he didn't seem to be as dangerous. However, it was best not to get too careless. I may have been an exception, but 'Disintegration' was very dangerous to most other people.

*Cardinal Nicolaus, I'll take note of that name.*

![break]

"About that, Luminas-sama, the Granbell you just mentioned, is it referring to the 'Master of Sun' Gran?" Hinata asked.

The name "Granbell" must've been foreign to her.

"Right. That guy was originally called Granbell. He was once the Chosen Hero of 'Light' and had even fought against me," replied Luminas, reminiscing in a slightly childish manner. It almost felt as though she was pretending to forcefully sound arrogant, or was I just overthinking it? Even though I'd been surrounded by ambiguous famous figures who came out of nowhere all the time, could she be...

Just as my thoughts drifted towards this direction, I received a furious glare.

*I must be overthinking it! That's why I should just keep these doubts to myself.*

"I see... I couldn't have guessed, but---" Hinata seemed to have something on her mind that she was concerned about, yet she couldn't manage to voice it.

"He used to be very strong, strong enough to stand against me," Hinata admitted.

"That's true. Since 'People who become Chosen Heroes will be bound by causality^[This term is not clear, I'm interpreting this as something similar to the causality in Berserk.]', he may have resented me deep down in his heart."

It was all clear to me now. Just like Milim mentioned, Chosen Heroes and Demon Lords both couldn't escape the effect of causality.

Granbell only pledged allegiance to her because Demon Lord Luminas defeated him. But perhaps he had a lot of other emotions bottled away. Even though he was able to mentor many heroic and legendary figures, he couldn't escape the cycle of causality. ~~Have you heard the tragedy of Darth Granbell the wise? It's not a story the Seven Luminaries would tell you. It's a Lubelius Legend. So powerful and so wise he was able to mentor many heroic and legendary figures. He became so powerful...the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually of course, he did. It's ironic he could save others, but not himself.~~

These however were just my guesses.

"Anyway, we can finally be reassured now. Demon Lord Clayman, the Kingdom of Farmus, the Seven Luminaries, all of the trouble-makers have been taken care of."

Hearing my conclusion, my subordinates with Benimaru in the lead, all nodded in unison.

"That's one thing resolved now," Rigurd laughed mirthfully. Noticing that the previously tense atmosphere had dissipated, I spoke cheerfully as well: "Hehe, that's true. Even though there were some tricky opponents, most of the problems seem to have been taken care of now. However, it would spell trouble for us if there's still someone out there furtively plotting against us. Had we not discovered the existence of those scheming merchants, I would have suspected the person responsible for all this to be Yuuki."

Honestly, Yuuki was highly suspicious. He knew that I headed to the Kingdom of Ingracia and had connections with Hinata as well, so he was a prime suspect. That's why I still harbored mistrust towards Yuuki despite my heart telling me not to.

"Yuuki? Are you referring to the head of Freedom Association, Yuuki Kagurazaka?"

I replied with a "Yeah" since Renard asked. You could figure it out if you thought about it calmly. He may have been the most suspicious based on the circumstances, but Yuuki had nothing to gain from me and Hinata fighting. Since there was no motive, it didn't make sense to consider Yuuki as the mastermind pulling the strings.

![break]

<<...>>

![break]

In other words, I could interpret it as someone intentionally framing Yuuki. Perhaps it was an elaborate trap set to make me suspect him. This was something that those eastern merchants were capable of. They even had a hand in arranging conflicts at different locations. If the Seven Luminaries were the masterminds, it made sense why the merchants did it.

However---

"Yuuki being the mastermind... It's definitely not him---actually, I can't really say that," Hinata claimed right after I had finally become reassured.

"Hold on, hold on, are you suspecting your fellow countryman?"

"Huh? I'm just considering all the possibilities. Moreover, it may be too soon to conclude that the masterminds have all been eliminated. After all, we still don't have a clue about the people who defeated Roy, not even their motive. And the most central faction of the eastern merchants is still rooted in the Western Nations."

I felt as if a bucket of cold water was dumped on me as these blind spots were pointed out.

*She's right, it is too early to conclude with confidence.*

"You are right in considering that. We can't be too optimistic before everything is resolved," I said, reigning in the casual attitude.

"It makes sense, so let's inform everyone else as well."

Benimaru nodded along while the Holy Knights seemed to be on the same page as well.

"Just as Hinata has said, there is a high probability that the mastermind remains alive. It was me who suggested that the Seven Luminaries are the culprits, but those are just merely conjectures. We can't conclude anything without decisive evidence. We will have to keep our minds on the matter in the future as well."

Everyone nodded in agreement to my line of thinking.

Indeed, it's not good to draw conclusions so preemptively. Even though I was quite confident with my deduction this time, Wisdom King Raphael-san didn't agree. But nor did it deny, so perhaps it meant that the possibility existed. Either way, evidence based on my thoughts alone was as good as nothing. That's why I should trust Raphael-sensei.

The Holy Knights agreed as well, so this would do.

![soft scene break]

All right, now both of our parties have caught up with our understanding of the situation. Whether there was a true mastermind lurking in the shadows or not---we certainly needed to figure that out, but that was for later. Right now we were to focus on the immediate problem, that is, our future relations, as well as clearing out any subsequent enmities between our parties.

It just so happened that Shuna then came serving coffee and snacks. The meal of the day was scones with potato chips.

As expected of Shuna; her timing was just perfect. We naturally went on to grab servings of the food while the Holy Knights sat there, looking somewhat bewildered.

"Oh, is that dessert? I want the ones on the large plate."

Veldora was quick to join at times like this even though he didn't participate in the discussion at all.

"Yes, I know that," Shuna responded as if she was used to it too.

"Wow, this also tastes delicious."

Seeing that Hinata had taken a bite, the Holy Knights jumped in as well... The atmosphere of the venue became somewhat of a period of break and leisure.

I took a breath of relief as I finished my desserts. Switching gears, I slowly said: "Next, we will discuss our future relations---"

"Before that, we have to be clear on something," Hinata cut me off.

"Regarding the incident, have you already accepted our apologies?"

"Yes. I don't intend to hold anyone further accountable. That way, we can build a friendly relationship in the future," I answered.

This was not only my will, but the decision reached by executives such as Benimaru and the others as well. There was no need for further conflicts. Since the misunderstanding had been clarified, we should just make peace. That was the answer we gave based on those considerations. But someone couldn't accept it, that being Luminas.

"That won't do. Being indebted to someone does not sit well with me. It is obviously our fault this time, so that's why we will have to compensate in some way or another. We will discuss peace-making later," Luminas glowered at Veldora while speaking.

To put it in simpler terms, she just didn't wish to owe any form of favor to Veldora.

"Since Luminas-sama has voiced her thoughts, I would like to inform you that I also still feel guilty giving you all the trouble. This is also our chance to show the highest extent of our sincerity," Hinata chimed in following Luminas. With that being said however, regarding compensation...

As I mentioned just now, we didn't wish to resolve things with money. Luminas's party---or rather the Holy Empire of Lubelius---if they were willing to recognize us...with an additional public announcement of a permanent ceasefire and then we're all good.

"Hmm---if that's the case, could you formally acknowledge our nation and form diplomatic ties with us?" As I brought the matter up, Luminas immediately agreed.

"No matter. But I don't intend to be too close with you guys since I'll punish that lizard one of these days regardless."

Most of Luminas's animosity seemed to be directed at Veldora, so worst-case scenario we would just have to throw him under the bus as a sacrifice. If that were the price of eternal peace, I would make the choice without hesitation.

"Hold on, Rimuru. Were you thinking about something super mean just now?"

"You're overthinking it, Veldora-kun. If you behave yourself and act intelligently, there is nothing to be worried about."

"Wait a sec, aren't you always thinking about something cruel whenever you add '-kun' to whomever you address?!"

*Tsk, Veldora has grown sharp as well. But he's still too naive.*

"Ahh, don't be so uptight. I'll give you my scones, so just behave yourself around Luminas."

"What? I should handle it well if that's the case. By the way, once I get serious, getting Luminas's recognition would be a piece of cake! GA---HAHAHA!"

See? Veldora was very simple-minded. Even Luminas looked dumbfounded by it, she didn't seem to be retracting her promise though.

"Don't get ahead of yourself~~, B-BAKA~~! Well then, I shall make this the exception and cease hostilities from this day onward for the next hundred years. We may even form diplomatic ties with you in the process. This will be the sign that I indeed have compensated you."

Luminas immediately declared a truce like it was nothing. The level of her frankness was astounding.

Umm, was this really okay? I was surprised. The same went for Benimaru. Even the chiefs such as Rigurd were shocked at Luminas's decision. The same went for Hinata and the rest, none of them seemed to have anticipated this turn of events.

"It's ok if it's just a pact of non-interference, but are you really going to form diplomatic ties with them?" Hinata asked. Luminas apparently didn't want to answer.

"Annoying. I've already made the decision!" she threw out her response almost as if saying "I'll leave whatever comes next to other people" while taking another scone. Hinata had a strong urge to express her concerns, but she also didn't plan on defying Luminas.

"If that's the case, we can only obey."

She nodded in agreement with Louis's statement and began to contemplate how to conclude the whole ordeal. There was however someone who still held a strong opposition.

"Diplomatic tie? If we do that---" Renard said.

He peeked at Hinata, as if uncertain if he should bring up his issues with the proposal.

"It's actually not bad. If Rimuru-dono's party were truly evil, we wouldn't be alive at this point."

"Indeed. Rimuru-dono and his party are worthy of trust. We should rid ourselves of the bias against monsters."

"I concur. For instance, Souei-sama has much the style and elegance of a gentleman."

Fritz responded somewhat frivolously while Arnaud and Ritase added on. Even the man of few words, Bacchus, gave the green light. However, Renard was still very cautious despite what his companions had said. As expected from the vice-commander of the Holy Knight Order; he was not willing to compromise that easily. But the circumstances must have given him some ideas, so Renard spoke with determination.

"However, there are still problems remaining. What should we do about our doctrines? Due to its influence, the whole world will point fingers at the Western Holy Church. We can't allow such a thing to happen no matter what."

The doctrines---the prohibition of co-existence with monsters---was that it? Indeed, once they acknowledged us, what would become of those doctrines? Things seemed to have become more complicated just when we thought it would all be over. Yet just as my thoughts went in that direction, Luminas, the individual responsible, dropped a bombshell.

"How boring. I didn't make those doctrines anyway, so I won't consider it to be a betrayal if we stop following them. Those are basically just some signs of direction for the lost lambs of the civilian masses, which the people in charge at the time drained their brains in coming up with."

Luminas's statement had quite the impact. Not only the Holy Knights, but even Hinata was astonished as she muttered: "What?! That's the first time I've heard of it..."

"Is that so? It's nothing strange really even if you didn't know about it. Even though the base scriptures of the doctrines are still available for browsing, the original manuscripts about its origin have long since been lost. You should have an idea of how our religion came about after reading those manuscripts," Louis replied flatly.

This was Louis's explanation:

![break]

It is said that the origin of the doctrines was for the protection of the people believing in Luminas. It may be a different case for advanced species such as Luminas and Louis, however lower vampires require raw human blood to maintain their livelihood. Moreover, it was rumored that the blood of humans overflowing with joy is particularly appetizing. At the time when monsters in the world reigned supreme, people had to strive just to survive. And in terms of the vampires, they could only receive inferior human blood, which posed a life or death problem for the vampiric race. It was because of that, that Luminas took the opportunity to draft a plan to protect humans.

![break]

The reason why she moved her kingdom seemed to have been due to Veldora-san... I managed to suppress my urge to inquire about it. After all, trying to pry into the matter would simply be asking for more trouble.

"Because I needed to protect my innocent people, I allowed the humans to live with joy. Moreover, if there is ever any threat posed by demon lords, the humans would feel reassured that someone is protecting them. In this way they can peacefully enjoy their life. The people of Lubelius were thus protected in the name of god."

Although this may be a bad metaphor, they seemed to be little more than "livestock".

Even though it was said that they needed to suck out raw blood, they really only required a tiny amount, mostly unnoticeable by the donor. And after all, there was an overwhelming number of human citizens compared to the population of vampires there, so it was understandable.

The price of living a safe and secured life was by donating one's blood. It's almost a win-win situation.

"In other words, in the holy scripture---in the doctrines of Luminism---many entries were added to prevent unnecessary casualties because of monsters?"

"Indeed, that is the case."

"To me, the important thing is having a heart of belief. Aren't you all capable of using 'Holy Magic' due to your faith in me? It is a form of contract and an iron law. The task of protecting my people is a duty for my vassals, something I don't really value at all."

In other words, her conclusion was as follows:

![break]

No tolerance for coexistence with monsters---this doctrine is nothing but a cheap product in an attempt to control the people's faith. If that was the case, there was no need to follow such a doctrine strictly. They couldn't afford to go to the extent of forcefully altering the doctrines, which would plunge the Western Holy Church into chaos. To put it simply, they only needed to find a reason to persuade the people to accept us.

![break]

This was the solution I guess, but Renard still didn't seem to be able to approve, wearing a grimace on his face.

"I can sort of understand that our doctrines didn't come from the divine will of Luminas-sama. But there is a very real question at hand, that we have always been leading our lives following the doctrines. There will be problems if we simply discard them..."

Indeed, if they were to completely ignore the previous directions, the followers and the current establishment of the Church would no doubt experience extreme backlash. Even if Luminas showed herself before the public, there was no saying whether or not they will believe she was the real god itself. More importantly, there was no way Luminas would ever do such a thing... If that is the case, it would go against the long-established beliefs of people who still stood with the doctrines and cause internal division.

Renard was evidently quite troubled by this matter.

"Even if that's the case, we still have to do it. I was trying to keep the situation down a notch until the issue gets resolved, yet you had already mobilized hundreds of troops. The news has probably already spread to the other nations. Moreover, didn't all the reporters from the Western Nations witness the defeat of the Three Martial Sages?" Hinata inquired in a serious tone as she shifted her gaze, glancing over at me.

Hinata had a point. Diablo mentioned that he defeated a man called Sare of the Three Martial Sages, there was apparently someone else at the scene, but then he turned tail and ran. After the reporters' eyewitness testimony of this chain of events, the status of Hinata and the rest of the guardians of mankind was surely going to suffer a disastrous decline.

In addition to the news of the defeat of the Holy Knights, there would likely be unnecessary chaos. Although according to how Diablo put it, he may be able to pressure the reporters...

*Ayy, how troublesome.*

"If that's the case, we can just resolve it by claiming that Hinata and I ended in a draw. Since we discovered the evil plan of the Seven Luminaries, we were able to declare a truce. My true identity as a slime is already public knowledge, and if the broadcast adds on the information that I am a reincarnated otherworlder, shouldn't that, to some extent, be acceptable to the public?"

"That indeed sounds like a great proposal for us. But are you really okay with that? Wouldn't the news that a demon lord ended up in a tie with me tarnish your prestige as a demon lord?"

*Prestige?---I've got none of that.*

I felt like Shuna's been lecturing me a lot lately. Whenever I encountered anything troublesome, I just tossed it to Rigurd to deal with it. All I did was travel and chill with Gobta... That's why a tie or two wouldn't really have an impact on my name.

"There shouldn't be an issue. You can even say that I was defeated."

Anything goes with things like victory or defeat. I answered the way I did because it was simply what I thought, yet it seemed to have a profound impact on Hinata and the rest.

"I mean, if you consider carefully, there are very few real examples of humans defeating a demon lord. There will be severe consequences if you just go and simply claim something like that. It may even cause the balance of power to collapse."

"T-That's exactly the case! You've just become a demon lord. If you allow other factions to look down on you under such circumstances, you'd be asking others to intrude on you and your domain!"

Hinata and Renard both tried to persuade me out of it. Most likely because they were worried about me, however...

"Benimaru, do you know of any possible forces that may invade this land?"

"Not at the moment. Even if there is anyone foolish enough to invade, I shall destroy them for you."

*Hmmhmm, how reliable.*

As for the Western Nations, Diablo was making proper arrangements. The rescued reporters apparently became his tools to exploit, so right now he seemed to be pushing his plan forward with an iron fist. As reports have pointed out, sooner or later Youm would be crowned as the new king. Even the small neighboring nations near Farmus were helping to accelerate the process. If that were the case, the only country left that possessed sufficient force to battle against us would be the Kingdom of Ingracia. Right now, with Luminas's promised hundred-year buffer period, we'd effectively conquered the Western Nations.

![break]

It was the same with the demon lords. I defeated Clayman in front of their eyes, which had quite the effect in setting an example. As long as I remained alive, even if the news of my defeat came out, they probably wouldn't believe it. They may suspect it is a trap and instead proceed with caution.

"How confident. I have no objection if that's the case. Then we shall take your proposal graciously and use it effectively."

"While we're at it, why don't you make an announcement about how the residents of our nation 'Are not bad people'!"

"You are right. Honestly, the citizens of this town are all very kind. It is hard to believe that they are goblins and orcs."

"It is still debatable whether demi-humans are monsters or not. But I think those are just discriminations caused by bias."

"Right. It would certainly be challenging if the humans become hostile against demi-humans while races such as dwarves are considered as an actual part of humanity. If they are categorized as monsters, even the elves would fall under the same category."

Races such as ogres and lizardmen were originally considered as demi-humans, yet due to their hostility against humans, they were categorized as monsters. As for their evolved forms (youki and dragonewts respectively), they were not categorized as monsters but instead as Earth Deities.

In short, the only point of distinction is whether they were hostile to humans or not. For this reason, it would be impossible to lump all monsters together as enemies.

"We have had diplomatic ties with the Dwarven Kingdom as well, so it would be fine if we talk King Gazel into making a hundred-year friendship. Wouldn't it add some credibility to our promise to not attack humans?"

Hinata nodded, seemingly making her mind up as well.

"I suppose that's fine. It would be much easier to persuade them and earn their trust. Moreover, since we have the opportunity, we may also eliminate the people with deep connections with the Seven Luminaries in the process."

It gave the impression that the Western Holy Church wasn't so unified either. But it wasn't anything strange. I guess that's just what it means to be an organization.

Hinata's voice was ruthless and cold, so no one dared to object. She planned to take the opportunity and push all the charges onto the Seven Luminaries. Even though this method seemed dirty, that was Lubelius's business. It wasn't an issue we could have a say in, so we just let them have their fun.

![break]

Then we begin to discuss the details.

For future communication, Arnaud and Bacchus decided to temporarily stay here, though they would first need to return to their home nation for preparations. They apparently planned to bring some civil servants along as well. As for us, we planned to take the time to construct a Luminism church for their accommodation. I didn't think it would take more than two weeks' time. We should be seeing believers of Luminism coming in and out of our nation in the future as well. Although it was disconcerting to acknowledge religious freedom, it would all work out in the end. If there's a will there's a way.

Honestly, the monsters didn't believe in any god. There wasn't a single almighty deity that was widely recognized in this world, which was quite different compared to my previous world. There were indeed religions, but they were more like, for example, tributes to the earth deities. In a practical sense, they believed in deities who would actually respond to their prayers with actual aid. A good example would be the Worshippers of Dragons who revered Milim. Among the many religions of this nature, Luminism held the greatest power. The hands and feet of Luminas that were the Holy Knights would aid the weak, thus earning the trust of the public. If we changed our perspective, we could just consider this as our nation receiving a branch of the Western Holy Church that would help the weak.

I figured that even though there may not be such a chance, we may still help each other out if there was ever any trouble. When any threats appear, we may fight alongside the Holy Knights. Then, we'd have no reason to say no. Naturally they would be under surveillance, but with some freedoms.

And just like that, we were able to come to a compromise on the whole thing.

![soft scene break]

This concluded the difficult topic.

We made a deal with Luminas, thus the plan for the Holy Empire of Lubelius to acknowledge us had also been properly laid out. Those would be sufficient as compensation. We would only have to build a good relationship through communication on top of that. The duration was one hundred years, so we would have to utilize this period of time wisely so both parties could better acquaint themselves. Therefore, we agreed upon doing exchanges with the Holy Knights on a regular basis, starting with the sharing of our technology. This battle had greatly damaged their weapons as well, so I suggested that we would help repair them. On the surface, we were just demonstrating how high the technological standards of our nation were, but our real intention was to examine the properties of their weapons.

![break]

We first got our hands on a set of those rare armaments of light^[Referring to the "Spirit Armament" in vol 7.]. Wisdom King Raphael-sensei said it would offer the user's mana---which is their spirit aura---to the spirits so that they could be materialized. Because the sample had been destroyed due to overcharging, I exchanged it with a set of armor that Garm crafted. The Holy Knights seemed to think it was a bad deal, but they still gave it to us without reservations since they felt sorry for the incident this time.

I initially thought that Hinata would have objected, but it turned out she didn't. That's why I decided to gift her a sword that I personally handcrafted. And speaking of the sword Hinata used, its name was "Moonlight Rapier (Moonlight)". I heard that Luminas gifted it to her and that it possessed great power. Or I should say, it was a little overpowered. I figured that it was just a unique-grade weapon of the highest level, yet it turned out to be a legendary weapon.

According to Kaijin and Kurobee, the quality of magisteel evolved over time. That's why after a period of time, first-class gear would apparently evolve as well, their quality increasing exponentially. The evidence being the items retrieved from ancient ruins. It was said that they've discovered ultra-quality gear that modern technologies were unable to replicate. These things were crowned the titles of legendary and were often sealed away, so normally there wouldn't even be a chance to lay eyes on them.

Both Kurobee and Garm seemed to be aiming to craft such a weapon. The two were mesmerized after laying eyes on Hinata's Moonlight Rapier. I hoped they would reach that goal someday.

Moreover, due to the sword's incredible nature, it was only used in crucial moments. If she tried to unsheathe the sword in the town, it would cause enormous hazards to the surroundings, considering its level. It would be like carrying a rocket launcher instead of a pistol for self-defense. There's no way you could just casually swing something like that around on a daily basis. I gifted her a sword based on these thoughts, and she seemed to like it a lot more than I expected.

Hinata's rapier was destroyed after I devoured and recycled it, so I created a new sword after analyzing and improving upon her previous weapon.^[This is referring to her rainbow sword] Its quality reached unique-grade, so it shouldn't have been much different in practice. After all, even its special ability of 'Dead End Rainbow' was recreated.

I also took in the broken greatsword called Dragon Buster or something. Its quality was surprisingly garbage. Seriously, how in the world could that thing possibly defeat Veldora?

There were also things like the 'Gear of Holy Spirit'---but they wouldn't allow us to see that. It was unique to Hinata and the original gear for the Spirit Armament. *Aww, I really wanted to analyze it---*

![break]

<<Notice. Said information has been collected during combat and completed with 'Analyze and Assess'.>>

![break]

*...Umm...what?*

*C-completely flawless in action, Raphael-sensei. Or should I perhaps address you as grandmaster from now on?*

![break]

<<...>>

![break]

*Ah, you don't seem to be in the mood for that, I guess. I should just thank you nicely in advance.*

Ok, this is epic. And speaking of which, Raphael sure was a ruthless character. With the results of the 'Analyze and Assess' of the inferior version of the Spirit Armament combined with information from my fight with Hinata, we were seemingly able to recreate the 'Gear of Holy Spirit'. It must've originally been a piece of equipment with Holy-element, but based on its principle of function, it may have been modified to possess monster-element.

Sorry Hinata.

'Gear of Holy Spirit' appeared to be some confidential equipment on a national level, and now we made it ours using 'Analyze and Assess'. It appeared to be rather tricky to use, so I had to figure out who to give it to. Just like that, we added another powerful item to our nation's arsenal.

![soft scene break]

It was evening by the time we finished, reaching an understanding on the exchanges. Since we had wrapped up everything, I suspected the Holy Knights would want to return early, but I still invited them to dine with us out of courtesy.

"Right, Hinata and Luminas. It's quite late already, so why don't you set off tomorrow?" I threw out casually, really.

After all, Luminas could use 'Spatial Movement' to return anyway. Hinata no doubt had already logged a location in Lubelius using the elemental-magic 'Waypoint Transportation' as well. And of course, it would be the same for the other Holy Knights. They were all powerful individuals above Rank A, so they didn't need to worry about how to return. I presumed they would probably answer with "We are truly sorry, but we should leave since our business here is done" or something along those lines to quickly bail. However---

"We are truly sorry---"

Hmm hmm, that's right---or so I thought, but what Hinata said next was completely unexpected.

"---to bother you, but since you've asked, do bear to accommodate us tonight as well."

"Yeah. I liked that hot spring very much, and the food was delicious too. I'm looking forward to tonight as well!"

Hmm? How strange? Not only Hinata, Luminas didn't seem to be planning on returning either. Seeing that the two had made the decision, even the Holy Knights who planned to return changed their minds. With smiles on their faces, happy chatter with their fellow colleagues broke out.

*Are the Holy Knights really okay behaving like this?*

But those were just my thoughts. I couldn't take my words back at this point in time. Since they were already looking forward to it this much, let's give them a night to remember.

.........

......

...

"All right then, since this is the case, we are having sukiyaki^[Japanese style hot pot] today!"

![break]

" " "WOAHHHHH!" " "

![break]

"..."

How should I put it, up until yesterday we were still enemies, yet now my subordinates were having a jolly fun time with the Holy Knights.

*Ahh, that does put a smile on my face...* There was just a small part of me that was conflicted, "Is this really okay"?

In this world, clergymen who couldn't eat meat seemed to be a non-existing taboo. It must have been due to the lack of food that they were not picky about what they ate. For this reason, I decided to treat them with chicken-duck and cow-deer^[Still no clue what to call these chimera] we recently started to develop. There were also freshly picked vegetables. Shuna had made this effort since they would be more suitable in a hot pot. The bones of the chicken-ducks would be brewed into broth soups while their meat was served raw like sashimi. The main course was the jowl meat of the cow-deer, served with the sukiyaki for everyone to enjoy. In addition, everyone received one sanitized chicken-duck egg as well.

*That should do. They will definitely be delicious.*

"Well then, to the prospect of a lasting friendship, cheers!"

![break]

" " "Cheers!" " "

![break]

The feast that night kicked off with my toast.

![break]

First, we had the cooked rice that was well received the day before.

*Don't be so picky with its black color. It would be a waste to share the white rice reserved only for me with these people who don't know its value*.

Only Hinata was looking at my bowl enviously, so I ordered to prepare some for her since we both came from the same place.

Plain white rice^[I think it is referring to eating normal cooked white rice without any other additional ingredients or cooking process.] was the most delicious rice after all, although fried rice tasted great too. We requested the Kingdom of Blumund to provide us with rice to cook, but there was still room for improvement. Those couldn't compare at all with our white rice.

"There's even white rice... Aren't you living too much of a perfect life^[Perfect as in everything Rimuru wants gets fulfilled.]?" Hinata grumbled, ostensibly displeased. Her voice was shaking a little too. Could it be that she still wasn't contented?

"If you have a problem, you can return the white rice---"

"I never said that!" Hinata interrupted me while shielding her bowl.

Are you really getting worked up over something like that? How childish---But those were just my thoughts; *I'd better not say it out loud.*

"But it's truly astounding, baffling even how you were able to recreate the food from that world so perfectly. You managed to build such a comfortable environment in a mere span of two years... The things we desire, yet are incapable of accomplishing, you have done so easily..."

"It's nothing really. But you can praise me more."

"Jokes aside, when I heard the rumors from Yuuki, I thought he was exaggerating. But that was because even Yuuki had only heard of these rumors through his espionage agents. It's truly hard to believe without seeing it for yourself..." Hinata said, full of frustration.

It was no use telling me these things, not to mention the fact that I still haven't been able to reach my end goals anyway.

"No, this is still not enough. The transportation of goods is way too slow while the speed of information transmission is subpar as well. Even though there is magic, the issues concerning our living environment and food have only been improved to some extent."

"To some extent... Geez...it's like you are mocking all of our progress so far. How dare you even say such a thing after recreating all these delicious dishes!"

My statement seemed to have ticked off Hinata. With that being said however, progress will stagnate once you start getting complacent. I was the king of a nation after all, so my ambitions should be grander. King in name while also being a demon lord...

"That's precisely why, even though the food aspect has been satisfying, we are still lacking in culture. Our entertainment industry is also lacking. Like the manga Veldora reads, that's the type of entertainment I hope to make."

"Entertainment? Seriously? ...When people already have to give everything they have just to survive in this harsh world!"

"Yeah, that's true. That's why we are working on eliminating threats like dangerous monsters. There's no point in hiding anymore, so I'll make this clear now. I plan to make Youm the king and build a new nation. Moreover, we plan to establish an influence on the Western Nations."

"What are you on about? I want an explanation."

*Since you want an explanation, an explanation you will get.*

"I have a lot of ideas, first of all---"

![break]

I launched into a discussion about my ideas for the future while eating the sukiyaki. The current plan was to have the human society accept us. Given that all the leaders of the world had come to know us, this plan was halfway to success. There were even reports of suspected spies being sighted in our nation. We thus showcased our harmless side to them without even noticing. The news should also have been spreading among merchants and adventurers so that the civilians of different kingdoms would learn about the prospect of our coexistence. However, it would probably take some time before such an idea firmly took root. But we'd get there one day, so there's no need to rush.

Next in line was the preparation of roads. We were working on that aspect as well at the moment. We were constructing trade routes that could be traveled with the guarantee of safety. The roads to Dwargon and Blumund had been opened and now we were planning to commence new construction projects to the Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion. I also planned to work on the construction of the road to the Beast Kingdom Eurazania in the future.

Going hand in hand with this was the matter concerning communication. Since I had no concept for wireless transmission, I had to give up the idea. Now, even though it may be easy to seek answers from Wisdom King Raphael-san, it would be difficult to get everyone else to understand. The three dwarven brothers and Kaijin could probably understand, but I couldn't rely on them for everything.

This proved to be a problem for future study. I wished to place my hope in the children and build up schools for their education. Right now, we were only at private school (Terakoya)^[Not exactly private school in the western sense. The term here is "寺子屋" which is referring to private institute in the ancient Japan Edo Period for educating commoners. In other words, this is a very basic level of education.] level where we taught kids about writing and basic arithmetic. But I aspired to use my network formed during my time as a teacher to hire some human tutors.

![break]

But going back to the original topic, let's talk about communication. Right now, the available communication network was mostly formed by communicative crystal balls that only mages could operate. Moreover, they stood the risk of being stolen, given that they were magic items after all. In fact, there were several cases of theft involving them. More importantly, we had to assume that there may be no available mage when an emergency call needed to be made. We had to find a medium that didn't run the risk of being stolen and was also accessible to anyone. These were quite demanding terms, yet there turned out to be a solution.

I had my eyes on 'Sticky Steel Web' and magisteel. I already tried it with Souei. The conductivity of telepathic thoughts through my 'Sticky Steel Web' was extremely high. There were also magicules within it, lending the clarity of communication a very high quality. There was also magisteel, which possesses large amounts of magicule as well. That's why I suspected it had similar properties to 'Sticky Steel Web'. It turned out to be exactly the case after I ran an experiment. That's why I decided to use them effectively.

I would process magisteel into cables with a diameter of around one centimeter and connect them to all the major cities using 'Shadow Step'. That alone wouldn't do the trick, but in conjunction with the device that Vesta and the rest developed, it was going to convert one's thoughts into voice and image. The device could be run even without mana, which was why the devices could be installed as soon as they were developed. Therefore, all we could do was to start preparing the necessary magisteel.

Due to our nation having a huge population of monsters, the iron ores stored in our warehouses would become magic ores overtime. We would be processing them into "Magic Steel String" and have individuals capable of 'Shadow Step' connect the wires. Since there weren't any obstacles, setting them up would likely be effortless. Depending on how much we could make, we would not be connecting wires exclusively to major cities, but also the villages along the main lines of the network as well. We had that part planned out too. We just had to wait for the development of a transmitter.

Coming from a world thoroughly defined by the Information Age, I couldn't overlook the importance of transmission speed.

"What do you think, won't it be convenient after it is completed?" I bragged to Hinata.

Once the communication network was complete, we would focus on creating recreation opportunities and developing our culture. My dreams were getting grander day by day, leaving tons more things left to do. I hoped that with the fulfillment of these dreams, we could finally live a safe and comfortable life.

![break]

Without noticing, the venue of the feast had turned dead silent. It seemed that I was too mesmerized in my speech that all the Holy Knights had been frozen out of shock. In contrast, the eyes of all my subordinates were glowing with enthusiasm. My ramblings must've motivated them.

Seeing how we were acting, Hinata muttered, baffled: "I mean... Normally shouldn't this kind of information be considered a state secret? Especially the part about communication, you can't just tell people from other countries. Never mind, this is fine I guess..."

Hinata's statement was like a bucket of cold water pouring over my head. I may have talked too much after getting a little too cocky. It was all because of the alcohol.

---Such an idea, getting drunk, was another big misstep of mine.

I was too busy thinking about how I screwed up when Wisdom King Raphael-san took things into its own hands.

![break]

<<Notice. 'Status Ailment Nullification' reactivated. In addition, I am afraid that the re-interference of said 'Resistance' is impossible to engage at the moment>>

![break]

W-what did you say! There was no use making up for the matter by complaining now. Moreover, this setting didn't seem to be switched on and off based on my thoughts. While ignoring my personal will, the effect of wines was forcefully nullified.

*Didn't I tell you that alcohol is not poison?!* My complaints couldn't move the stone heart of that cruel skill.

Riiiiight, I was drunk yesterday and had a headache this morning due to a hangover, all because I let myself loose and got hammered a bit too hard. Perhaps I wouldn't have spilled that much to Hinata had I not been drunk. I just gave up my struggle and considered the incident my own doing.

![break]

But apparently, I wasn't the only one getting in trouble because of alcohol.

I peeked at Hinata.

"Ayy ayy, isn't this great, Hinata-sama?! That means he really trusts us! Anyway, let's forget about that for now. I'll happily take this meat if you don't want it!"

The person in front of my eyes seemed to be someone named Fritz. The jubilant looking man was combing through Hinata's plate for good quality meat. I recalled him being one of the captains. His act of picking up the meat was precise and on-point. This type of absolutely fearless^[The source says "act that doesn't even fear god"] behavior must've been the result of someone getting far too drunk for his own good.

As the meat reached Fritz's mouth, veins popped out of Hinata's temple. It was only noticeable because her skin was so white and tender---of course that's not the only reason.

"Fritz... You have a death wish?"

"H-how strange? Hinata-sama, what's with the serious look..."

He seemed to have suddenly sobered up. Fritz jumped up from his seat ready to flee, but there's no escape from Hinata. His chin was hit by a knife-hand chop, causing him to collapse like a puppet whose strings had been cut after suffering a concussion.

I planned to use this fool as an example in the future for what happens when you drink too recklessly.

![break]

Fast forward to the next day...

"About the things you said yesterday, if your city is that extravagant, beware of getting attacked by the angels," Hinata gave me this last piece of advice that she suddenly remembered right before departing.

The feast last night was not suitable for discussing such matters, but she seemed to have decided to inform us after considering our future interactions. It must be the angel army Elalude mentioned to Gazel.

According to Hinata, those angels with individual ranking of B-plus would attack in an army of millions. The magnitude of which was unimaginable. They even had established a commanding system with positions ranging from captains to commanders. It was rumored that they even assigned generals. It was said that if one traced long enough back in history, you would discover that the angels have even once fought against the demon lords. Their abilities were unknown, but even when compared to the demon lords, they were still undoubtedly strong.

The angels would choose monsters and civilizations with highly developed cities as their attack targets. Even the Western Holy Church didn't consider angels as a friend of humanity. It became only natural if you looked at it from a different perspective, considering that after all, the true identity of the God Luminas was actually Demon Lord Luminas.

"I find those flying bugs annoying as well. I'd love to take care of them myself, but it would also reveal my true identity... But since that lizard fucked me over, the Holy Knights already know who I am."

Even Luminas had some grudge against the angels.

As for the Holy Knights, they claimed to have sworn to keep Luminas's real identity a secret. Given that was the case, we would likely have more room to negotiate the matter in the future.

"I've also heard about the angels from others, so I'm aware of it. If they plan to take on my country, I'll have to fight against them."

I had no intention of being courteous with them. Whatever this army in heaven thought was their own business, but if they wanted to force those views on us, we'd have a bone to pick.

"Hehe, I knew you'd say that. When that time comes, perhaps we will join hands in battle."

"The same goes for me. I don't intend to have my 'Capital' destroyed again, whether it be from those flying bugs or that lizard. Rimuru, if you don't wish to become my enemy, make sure you educate that lizard well."

Leaving these words, they then departed.

This has been quite the meaningful experience considering the insights we gained from them. We hoped to build a friendly relationship not only with Hinata but Luminas as well. And so, the series of conflicts with the Western Holy Church and Holy Empire of Lubelius concluded with a satisfying ending.

Soon after, sometime later---

The Holy Empire of Lubelius, which had been holding an attitude of silent acknowledgement towards the Dwarven Kingdom, suddenly made a public announcement that acknowledged the dwarves as friends of humanity. They followed the statement up with the declaration of establishing diplomatic ties with the monster kingdom of Jura Tempest Federation. Even though there was a time limit, they also expressed the signing of a non-aggression pact with us. Not only demi-humans, but monsters as well were acknowledged to be a part of humanity.

---With this incident as the trigger, people began to explore the new relationship between man and monster.
