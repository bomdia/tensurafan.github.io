# Chapter 4: Reception|Ceremony

The labyrinth was nearly complete, so I ran back to the town. Veldora and Ramiris were still in the labyrinth. As for Milim, she'd help with the building process as well once she had caught enough dragons.

Speaking of which, was it really all right for her not to return to her nation?

---While these doubts crossed my mind, at the end of the day it was Milim who would get scolded, so she could do whatever she wanted.

The other three deemed their respective floors unsatisfactory after seeing the traps that I had set up.

Until floor 30, we couldn't make the traps too harsh. On one hand, if the traps were too forgiving, we wouldn't be able to properly mess with the visitors. On the other hand, setting all the traps to hard mode would cause the adventurers to lose their interest.

If they didn't have a good time at the start, the number of customers would gradually decline. Based on these considerations, I set the traps myself for the first 50 levels. As for Veldora and Ramiris, I handed the lower levels for them to design. They must've been trying to come up with even more devious traps after seeing the evil traps I set when I was serious.

"Rimuru, it seems I've been mistaken. Apparently, traps are not to be set individually."

"That's not fair, I want to do one too!"

"Hmm. I focused too much on power, and it seems I didn't pay much attention to making it easier for the traps to lure people in. I gotta be more serious with the arrangements in the future."

Their comments on every single little thing was driving me nuts---I'm too lazy to care after all.

Floors 51 to 60 had been assigned to Ramiris, while Veldora got levels 61 to 70. As for Milim, she would be in charge of levels 96 to 99. These rooms would all have dragons, which would be the most difficult levels with the addition of terrain effects. I let them modify the floors to their heart's content, fully aware that they might devolve into pure insanity, but right now the adventurers could only get to level 50, so there shouldn't be any problem.

*If you're curious, level 95 had been made into a shelter for the beastmen. It would become a resting place in the future that provided expensive accommodation services. We'll take a wait and see approach, so I'll keep a mental note of this.*

As for the remaining floors from levels 71 to 94, we'd see what we could do with them later. For now, we left them as they were. However, since there's still a dense magicule content in that area, some monsters might end up spawning there. And as such, the rest of the work was handed to the trio who seemed to be more than happy to do the job.

![break]

A few days passed.

![break]

After avidly scanning the city, I noticed Myourmiles's party headed our direction. It seemed they had prepared and hurried their way over as soon as possible, as they arrived earlier than expected.

"Rimuru-sama, I've arrived late. I'll be in your care from today onward!"

"Ayyy, Myourmiles-kun. You are finally here. Let me take you to your house first," I welcomed Myourmiles and brought him to his newly built estate that I ordered Rigurd to construct beforehand. The house was ready to be checked in anytime now due to his comprehensive preparations. He carried out all my orders without hesitation; how capable he is indeed. I should acquaint Rigurd and Myourmiles sometime along the way. But though I said so, Myourmiles had already been doing business with our nation for the healing potions for quite some time, so the two were already very familiar.

The chores would thus be delegated to the goblina guides and Myourmiles's lackeys. I then visited Rigurd's office with Myourmiles.

"Rigurd, excuse us."

"Oh oh, isn't this Rimuru-sama?! Even Myourmiles-san is here too. To what do I owe the occasion?"

Rigurd was probably very busy, yet he still welcomed us with utmost haste.

"I see it is Rigurd-dono; It's been a while. Young master---I mean, Rimuru-sama---has always given me good care, so basically things went---"

Without me having to do anything, Myourmiles avidly began explaining.

![break]

We moved to the guest room and immediately dove into the discussion. We first talked about the construction progress of the colosseum as well as the conditions of the inns in the southwest area. Next, we touched on the future plans for the stores that we planned to open up near the aforementioned colosseum. Finally, we brought up the recently constructed labyrinth designed to attract adventurers to our town^[This is the part where I complain about my editors being fucking gaijin and self-interpreting the sources. But their feelings were hurt and removed my footnote, so I'm putting it down here again. Why am I complaining? Rimuru is a libtard basically.].

"---That's about it. While the preparations for the dungeon are all complete, we still need a little bit more time before we can call it finished. With that being said, however, as of right now there're not many problems left with it. The colosseum is not yet finished, but the stage has been constructed. Moreover, only the VIP area needs to be extravagant. As for the commoner seating, we can just drape the staircases with sheets. If that doesn't work, we can just turn it into a standing area."

We didn't have enough time, so we'd save the work for the original standing area for later. The exterior of the building had yet to be decorated, so we would have to wait until Mildo returned. But since we'd been meticulous about the security, even with the construction itself being only half-way complete, the colosseum had the necessary stylistic elements of a building.

Rigurd and Myourmiles listened to my words, enraptured. The three of us then began to plan enthusiastically.

Rigurd raised the issue about how to deal with foreigners visiting our nation. He also vowed to properly educate the residents of the town by then. As for the martial tournament and the dungeon, Myourmiles had planned out how the events was to unfold. He had been brainstorming a lot of ideas after my visit, so he was quite confident about it. After he finished speaking, he put on a proud smile.

![break]

Later on, we helped to check for any flaws in each other's plans. We also reflected on our own plans to see what else needed to be done in advance.

"With the addition of Myourmiles-san into the equation, our little undertaking just got wings," Rigurd commented, smiling.

"Isn't that true! Myourmiles-kun is a very capable man after all. If our Founding Festival concludes successfully, I intend to hand over our finance department to him," I mentioned the most important point to Rigurd.

I told him that I intended to appoint Myourmiles to be in charge of the Financial Department. In addition, he would also be managing the Commercial and Advertising Department. I hoped he would do his part for this nation.

Rigurd didn't seem to have any qualms about this, promising that he would be selecting candidates to become Myourmiles's subordinates.

Thanks to Vesta, the literacy rate here had increased across the board. But even in spite of that, not everyone was capable of reading, writing, and counting. Our country would continue to grow in the future, so talented individuals such as Myourmiles were of great necessity. Rigurd probably understood this as well and was not simply blindly tagging along with my proposal merely because I wished for it. That's why he himself also supported Myourmiles's appointment as an official of our nation. He was likely aware of the short-comings of our countrymen when it came to math. While it had nothing to do with our planned festival, he still welcomed Myourmiles's addition for that reason.

"---I see, that's a great idea!"

"No no no, I'm not that good yet. But, I, Myourmiles, will do my best to fulfill my duty!" Myourmiles responded humbly, but this man had always been ambitious. He joined the operation with intent from the start. If he made the Founding Festival a success, Myourmiles's dream of becoming an executive was sure to come true.

"But I will still need to show some results first, or else the others may not approve."

"Indeed. Although if Rimuru-sama gives the order, everyone will obey regardless..."

"I don't want to do that at all. Honestly, I think that I've been interfering too much in this whole thing already."

"That's right. A non-citizen of our nation becoming an executive, this matter alone will have a very good publicity effect. But in order to achieve that, Myourmiles-san has to make some outstanding achievement."

"That's right. Although I feel pretty bad asking so much from you, will you be willing to try to accomplish that, Myourmiles-kun?"

Indeed, that's where the difficulties lay.

With the only criteria being capability, gaining approval from the monsters became a trivial task. Diablo was a good example of this. When he wanted to be my No.2 secretary, no one had any objections. More accurately speaking, Shion objected, but that was more because Shion was an airhead. Diablo's strength was comparable to mine; that was an undoubted fact. No one dared to complain about the actions of such a dangerous person. That's why for my military officers, as long as I'd acknowledged them, they could become an executive. It was all fair game as long as they were strong enough.

But the same couldn't be said for civil officials. They were supposed to be recruited through examinations, but sadly we had yet to develop to that stage. People with prior experience such as Vesta were obviously welcomed, but they would still need to show actual results. After all, even Vesta was still just a consultant, in other words, he was considered as a guest.

I thought it was about time to promote Vesta to an executive too, but Myourmiles still needed to show some actual results. If possible, I hoped to recruit them both as ministers into the national organizations that aimed to update the structure of our kingdom.

Almost as if he were trying to blow away our worries, Myourmiles was wearing a very confident smile. I didn't dislike this mischievous looking grin.

"Hehehe, Rimuru-sama. Please do not underestimate me. I, Myourmiles, promise that I will meet your expectations and complete the job successfully!"

*Myourmiles, you are a truly reliable man. Your experience as a black-market boss doesn't seem to be for show. His thick-skinned attitude is really reassuring.*

"Hehehe, Myourmiles-kun, of course I have faith in you. I'll be counting on you then!"

"Although there may be failures along the way, I see that you still wish to boast about your future success. That being said, if you dare to betray Rimuru-sama's expectations, my iron fists will not be generous with you."

"Hold on, hold on, Rigurd-san? You can't do that! Shouldn't you be encouraging Myourmiles-kun to work hard?"

"Please be assured, I won't leave any evidence---"

"Ah, geez, Rigurd-san is so scary."

"I'll be counting on you then. I am *really* going to turn a blind eye to you."

Although this is what we said, both of us had evil grins on our faces. Rigurd was no stranger to Myourmiles, probably having long since accepted him. This fact alone was very comforting. At the end of the day, as long as everyone could accept Myourmiles, any justification goes.

And so we chatted amicably until the meeting concluded, with everyone leaving behind their closing thoughts. Afterwards, we began the preparation for the Founding Festival.

![break]

As such, the preparation work was proceeding bit by bit---

![soft scene break]

Fast forward to tonight.

![break]

"How is this possible... How can this be?! This house is a thousand times more comfortable than the upper-class inns found in the capital of Ingracia!" Myourmiles exclaimed the moment he moved into the new estate.

It seemed that he was highly satisfied with his new home, which pleased me as well.

"There's tap water, a magic-powered stove, and a bathroom. There's even a toilet here! It's like every single facility from all the classy inns is present here."

Myourmiles was astounded after hearing the elated reports from his subordinates.

"Y-Young master...Rimuru-sama? Is it really okay to be so extravagant?"

There's no use asking me this, as this was the standard issue facility of this nation. But, since Myourmiles's subordinates were staying at his place as well, his estate was a lot more luxurious than the average citizens' indeed. I asked people to build a house with the same standards with references to the estate Myourmiles resided in the Kingdom of Blumund. There were around ten rooms in total and some of them came with mini kitchens and toilets. There was also a large bathroom and canteen for communal use. Structurally it should accommodate a large number of residents.

"Is there such a need? It is a lot cheaper than preparing a home for everyone after all. Those who want to own their own house should start saving up right now to buy one in the future."

I couldn't manage to prepare a home for everyone, so I used the house exclusive to the executives instead. It's great to see that everyone was satisfied. I'd be covering the expenses, of course. I did this in consideration of the fact that Myourmiles-kun had assisted me in making profits, so surely, we would continue to collaborate in the future as well. With this in mind, I'd just consider this a necessary expense. Compared to the potential profits, the cost of covering his housing was quite insignificant.

"I-I see... In this kingdom, this is the standard issue? Then, do the cheap inns in the southwest area also have this standard?"

"They do. Although not every room has a bathroom, they are built with toilets. After all, there are large, cheap bathhouses nearby. Some inns even have free-to-use bathhouses."

"I see... I recall during the discussion at the start of all this, didn't you mention that you intended to make this city a spa resort? Now I finally understand, Not only are these amenities exclusive to the wealthy, but even the inn service for commoners has reached this level. It's no wonder why the adventurers keep coming back."

"Isn't this living environment too comfortable?"

"That's not just comfortable, compared to the entire western continent, the lodging here is the pinnacle of luxury. Now with a stable income from adventurers, this country surely will prosper as time goes on---"

"Hmmhmm."

"...! I get it now, so that's what this is about, Rimuru-sama!"

*Huh, what do you mean?*

Myourmiles shouted excitedly, completely ignoring me who seemed to be out of the loop with the whole ordeal.

"That's why you are building the dungeon! As expected of Rimuru-sama, I am completely vanquished against your peerless intellect."

"Oh, oh ho, yeah that's right."

*What are you on about?*

"Adventurers will come to hunt the monsters that spawn in the labyrinth. I originally thought that you were doing this to give them relief after they've lost their jobs as the Jura Great Forest became safe... Ah, how impressive, I've not expected you to think so far---"

*Giving relief? What now? Hold on, the monsters in the Jura Great Forest did decrease but... The dungeon is just intended to be a purely recreational facility---*

"That will work, that will definitely work! Because of the declining number of monsters, adventurers who are already having trouble making a living will be out of the market. As a result, there are probably people who will choose the dungeon as an occupation. We can also sell equipment and healing potions as such. We will not only be able to make this a health resort for tourism, but some may even start settling down in this nation. All the inns provide wonderful services and there's also the tourist attraction of the colosseum. In addition to meeting the demands for recreational and occupational needs..."

*I mean---is this the purpose of building the labyrinth?*

*I do intend to buy up the items that the adventurers collect, but that is essentially somewhat similar to buying back the little trinkets you earn in a carnival game*^[In Japan gambling with money is illegal but winning little toys and other worthless trinkets is fine. Then you can visit the shop located next door, where you can conveniently sell these items for hard cash, that's the loophole.]---Nonetheless, some of what Myourmiles was saying was indeed worth considering.

"You've only just arrived today, yet you already have such a solid grasp on the situation, Myourmiles-kun?"

"That is only natural. I'm confident that my ability to sense business opportunities will not lose to you."

"Hehehe, I have truly been defeated, Myourmiles-kun."

"Hahaha, surely you jest. It is all thanks to young master that I am like this."

"I'm not as confident in taking care of all this alone, that's why I wanted to have you handle the project---"

"Oh oh, is that true? I'm happy to help."

The plan to turn the dungeon into a workplace for the adventurers---Myourmiles joyfully accepted. He now had a huge workload on his shoulders, but man is he energetic. How capable.

I had never considered the possibility of having adventurers settle down here until Myourmiles pointed it out. While some people might think they could earn a profit through the labyrinth, most would just spend their money and leave---this recreational facility had somewhat of a gambling factor.

*I see, so the idea is to have the adventurers settle down and let them hunt the monsters in the labyrinth. Myourmiles sure is astute, and he has an interesting way of looking at things.*

Unlike the animal inhabitants, having the adventurers stay here would not disturb the ecosystem of the forest. In fact, we did need their help to clear the labyrinth before the monsters started running rampant. It would also give us time to buy and prepare the necessary ingredients. There was no issue with the replenishment of magicules with Veldora present. In other words, the monsters would start to gradually fill in.

This may turn out to be an amazing project. Adventurers would earn some money first before spending it in the town. Not only would we be able to line our own pockets, but we would also be able to support the adventurers.

The bought-back materials could then be processed and exported to other countries. As for the magic ores, we might even export them directly. We might need some of the magic ores though, so we didn't really need to export them all at once. Moreover, it might help if the Freedom Association came to set up a branch in our nation. When that time comes, to avoid cut-throat competition, we'd need to loosen our stranglehold to prevent boycott. If the association payed the adventurers, it would help us to acquire foreign goods.

We could then use that money to import things from abroad. Right now our trade relations with the Beast Kingdom Eurazania were on hold, and with the vegetables and grains produced in our nation alone, we wouldn't be able to feed the numerous adventures either. That's why we'd need to import things from other countries. Even if that weren't the case, it would still be fine as I planned to turn my kingdom into a trading powerhouse. We'd stick to the plan this time around, but I still had to figure out ways to transport more goods per run.

Given that was the case, I had formed a rough outline. I had a plan in mind to increase the width of the road. The roads were only half paved, with the other half still having exposed dirt. I planned to fit train tracks on the unfinished half to allow cargo trains to run on them.

![break]

"The only thing left now is the promotional work."

I was lost in my own visions of grandeur when Myourmiles's words brought me back to my senses.

Oh yeah, there's no use in rushing things now.

Putting aside the train tracks, simply developing trains would already take some time. However, we first needed to commence the Founding Festival successfully to leave a good impression on the other nations.

"This isn't enough to be called a promotion, but I've sent invitations to several heads of nations. Some reporters from varying countries have also agreed to help, so I figure that we will get plenty of guests---"

"Hmm. As expected of Rimuru-sama. If we are arranging the transportation of the royalties and nobles, we should do that before the snow melts, which is now. It seems that I don't have to worry about that anymore. Then, let me get in touch with some other renowned merchants to inform them about the festival being held in this nation."

"Can I trouble you to do that?"

"Just count on me. I've actually already made some preparations. I wanted to check out the condition of this nation first before confirming whether I should do so or not," Myourmiles cracked a smile as he replied.

I knew I could count on him.

"Ah, Myourmiles-kun is too amazing. Your shrewdness always impresses me."

"You're flattering me. It is Rimuru-sama who deserves these praises. Compared to how much of a visionary you are, my skills are nothing."

We exchanged looks, smiling...

*No no no, Myourmiles-kun's cunning mind is the actual thing that none can rival.*

As I thought that---

"Rimuru-sama, this plan will not fail. With all these amazing conditions in our favor, success is all but guaranteed!" Myourmiles proclaimed with a serious expression.

Overconfidence was a common fatal flaw, but hearing it from him made me feel reassured. Myourmiles seemed to have also been attracted by the food, environment, and comfort of this town. That's the reason why he reacted that way. It was like foreshadowing the success of our plan.

I stood up and extended my hand towards Myourmiles.

"I'll be counting on you, Myourmiles-kun."

"Leave it to me---"

Myourmiles reached out and clasped both of my hands, giving me his solemn oath.

While secretly praising him, I had faith that the plan would be a success.

![soft scene break]

That night, I was invited to dine at Myourmiles's estate.

![break]

After the meal, Myourmiles and I enjoyed a bit of leisure time while drinking black tea. It was then that Myourmiles gave his men the order to bring some people in. The ones who arrived were Bydd and Gobemon.

Considering Gobemon's personality, he should've still been carrying out his bodyguard duty while keeping Myourmiles in the dark. *So why did he come here? Does it mean that he is reporting directly to Myourmiles now?*

![break]

Disregarding that, a more pressing issue had become apparent.

"Rimuru-sama, speaking of this Gobemon-dono here, he seems to be a bodyguard you sent."

I was going to play dumb, but it seemed that Myourmiles has already figured out my little scheme involving Gobemon.

"That's true, but let's put that aside for now, Gobemon, what happened to your arm?"

Since the cat's out of the bag, I decided to instead focus on what actually concerned me. It was about Gobemon's right arm: all of it below the elbow was gone.

"R-Rimuru-sama! I-I'm truly...truly sorry. It was all my fault for being reckless and getting discovered by Myourmiles. This lost arm is the punishment for my foolishness."

As he finished, Gobemon got on his knees to beg for forgiveness. I was at a complete loss until Myourmiles came forth to help mediate.

"D-Don't get so emotional, Gobemon-dono. Please get up and have a cup of tea to calm down."

Myourmiles had Gobemon sit on a chair and had his men serve the prepared tea. After Gobemon regained his composure, he began to elaborate.

According to Myourmiles, he seemed to have been assaulted several times after our meeting. Myourmiles was no fool, so he gave orders to his own bodyguards such as Bydd to remain alert. But in the face of several crises, they were only able to avoid them with the help of a secret guardian---Gobemon of course---who intervened.

The ambushes were more frequent than I imagined, so they were able to deduce that someone had been secretly protecting them. From there, they were able to figure out that the only one who could be responsible was me which was why Myourmiles pretended that he hadn't discovered Gobemon.

But he didn't expect a key event that took place later on. In an act of vengeance, Viscount Kazak decided to resort to outrageous violence.

"I found someone to inherit the store in that nation (Blumund) and came here straight away. I was thinking that we would be safe once we got on the road, where the attackers wouldn't be able to strike as easily. We thus lowered our guard, but I didn't expect---"

![break]

The roads were overseen by patrols and there were many other merchants as well as adventurers around. To avoid accumulating snow, the street was also cleaned every day, letting people travel on it even during winter days. There shouldn't be an assault incident on such crowded streets and even if there were one, the patrols would hurry over. Myourmiles was well aware of that after traveling on the road several times before. For this reason, he lowered his guard, and as a result he was taken by surprise. He was ambushed at the corner of a street in a certain town.

![break]

"Village? Was it the one Bydd tried to con---was it the village where Bydd and I first met each other?"

"R-Right! That was the village Rimuru-sama and I first met!"

About Bydd...he was now Myourmiles's bodyguard, but during our first encounter, he was still a conman committing frauds. It probably wasn't appropriate right now to bring these things up from the past, so I'll just brush it off.

Bydd came to our side while helping to steady Gobemon. He then stood directly behind Myourmiles to eavesdrop on our conversation. After listening to our conversation, Bydd realized he had something to add. It was reported that a black carriage carrying a swarm of aggressive, Rank B monsters appeared out of nowhere.

Bydd, who was originally Rank C, and his companions were no match for those monsters. Each of them was prepared to make his last stand. With that being said, they still tried their best to assist the villagers in taking shelter and buying time.

It was then that Gobemon showed up.

"It was then that brother (aniki) Gobemon saved us!"

"That's right, not just me, everyone back at the scene is grateful towards Gobemon-san," Bydd and Myourmiles commented, but Gobemon still looked dejected.

"But, it's still an undeniable fact that I've failed---"

There was no way that Gobemon would have lost to those monsters. He took care of them in an instant. He was going to pursue the culprit afterwards, but it was then that a wild Rank B-plus basilisk appeared. Gobemon's right arm was caught in the spray of the petrifying gas; he was forced to immediately perform an amputation at the elbow.

The black carriage escaped during that interval.

"So the failure you were referring to was that you let the culprit flee?"

"That's part of it, the other being that Myourmiles discovered me..."

*Huh, so that's the failure you were talking about?*

"It's really no big deal if you were discovered, really. The bodyguarding was your main task. By the way, you should hurry and heal up your arm."

As I finished, I took out the healing potion from my 'Stomach' with the intention of giving it to Gobemon. Yet he bit his lips, unwilling to accept it.

"No, it was all because of my immaturity that I was injured. I wasn't able to defeat the basilisk on my own; it was with the help of Bydd and the rest that it was defeated. It was too embarrassing. And even though leaving me with one hand is inconvenient, it will regenerate over time anyway..."

Gobemon was very stubborn, or rather he was very prideful and relied too much on his own strength.

"Gobemon, do you think that it was shameful to ask for help from Bydd and the others?"

"I-I guess... It was my mission to be their bodyguard, yet I put the people I was guarding in crisis---"

"Hold on, Gobemon. You've got the wrong idea."

"Did I get the wrong idea?"

"Yes. You've gone too far playing the lone ranger. That is where you and Gobta are different."

The difference between Gobemon and Gobta was as simple as that one sentence suggested: the ability each person had to cooperate effectively alongside their subordinates.

Gobta wouldn't take on all the duties by himself. Even when against powerful monsters, he would order his subordinates to have everyone fight together. During simpler missions, it would appear that he was skipping duty and not doing much at all, and honestly, he really did slack off a lot, didn't he... Yet considering the growth of his subordinates, Benimaru thought that the way Gobta commanded his men was superior.

If it were Gobemon encountering a powerful monster, he would probably attack alone to get all of the spotlight, most likely because he was confident in his strength. Although Gobemon had his reason for doing that, acting alone wouldn't help his men grow. Moreover, if Gobemon were defeated...it would probably be impossible to retreat by relying on his subordinates alone. It might even lead to their total demise. It was for this reason that Benimaru favored Gobta's style.

And that's also why I hoped that Gobemon would learn to trust his companions more. Myourmiles was a man who excelled at leadership. I hoped whole-heartedly that Gobemon would see him as a role model.

"---That's why you should learn the importance of teamwork. With that being said, this is not me forcing you to do something with your companions, but to reserve your strength at times and only strike during times of crisis."

"I... I..."

"You are strong, everyone would agree to that. But strength alone is not enough for me to hand an entire army to you."

"..."

Gobemon seemed frustrated after hearing my explanation. I tossed the healing potion at him as I saw this.

"Ah!"

Gobemon's right arm started to regenerate immediately.

"Gobemon, you should stay in Myourmiles's care for now. Whether you decide to train Bydd and his men over there or just chill around, either is fine. In this town, Myourmiles doesn't need a bodyguard, so you should face your inner demons first."

"Y-Your Majesty---"

"At the end of the day, you will amount to nothing by fighting alone! You must have also learnt that from your failures this time. When you put your mind to it, I'm sure that you will know what to do next."

As I said that, I smiled at Gobemon. I then drew out the tachi on my belt and handed it over to him. His eyes were wide open, yet he couldn't believe what he was seeing.

"My gift for you."

"B-But... My mission..."

"Didn't you bring Myourmiles-kun here safely? Moreover, I hope that you will improve yourself in the future. So consider this sword to be a mirror that casts light over your heart so you may reflect on yourself every night."

If Gobemon could let go of his ego and arrogance, he was bound to grow and become more reliable.

"I understand! I, Gobemon, will definitely live up to your Majesty Rimuru's expectations!"

Gobemon's eyes burned with passion. He was already very ambitious and would quickly grow after setting goals. I was confident that he wouldn't disappoint me.

"Then, Myourmiles-kun, is it okay that I entrust Gobemon to you?"

"Hahaha, no problem at all. I was going to ask the favor from you anyway. All right Bydd, now Rimuru-sama has given the green light as you had wished. Gobemon-dono will be training you guys."

Myourmiles agreed as well, although it was after the decision was made. It seemed that Bydd and his men were all very welcoming of Gobemon. And just like that, Gobemon now became a guest in Myourmiles's care and was free to act on his own will from now on.

![break]

After leaving Myourmiles's estate, I lifted my head to gaze at the night sky. The constellations of the winter season shone brightly above; their locations seemed different from what they were on earth.

![break]

I was still somewhat wary of the incident with the ambusher. Was the culprit really Viscount Kazak? He was merely a noble of the rank of viscount, so was it even possible that he had enough status and power to prepare several monsters for an ambush? Moreover, while it's one thing to control rank B monsters, controlling a rank B-plus monster is a completely different matter. Only extremely wealthy people from large nations could tame these monsters---wait...hold on... Can you even purchase a Rank B-plus monster with money?

![break]

<<Answer. Previously Rank A-minus Summoner Thegis was able to summon a Rank B-plus lesser demon. It would not be unthinkable that someone has domesticated a basilisk.>>

![break]

Oh yeah, it wouldn't be that hard with 'Summon Magic'. It would certainly be a lot faster than using carriages to transport monsters. But under these circumstances... There's the 'Barrier' Shuna set up to interfere with magic...which the roads just so happened to be lacking.

"I should order people to tighten security..." I muttered as I left the scene.

![break]

The citizens of Tempest quickly welcomed Myourmiles with open arms. I had already introduced or mentioned him to the executives, and Rigurd would be responsible for informing the rest. With that being said however, the progress had been surprisingly smooth.

Myourmiles handled his work flawlessly. He had already become familiar with the subordinates I gave him in the blink of an eye, appropriately delegating work to all of them regardless of race. This also included Myourmiles's original followers, which immediately created a brand-new organization.

A competent man sure does things differently. Even though he was tasked with so many different jobs, Myourmiles was still full of energy.

Apart from running the new organization, he also utilized his own network to send out invitations to some influential figures. For instance, powerful nobles from landlocked countries and affluent merchants from all the large cities. There were also powerful figures from the capital of Ingracia, etc.

It seemed that the nation-founding festival that we planned to hold after the snow melted was going to be larger in scale than we imagined. And of course, we hadn't been idling on these projects. We'd been rehearsing for the plays that would be screened at the opera house, establishing the rules and procedures of the martial tournament, discussing the entry fee for the dungeon, and calculating the prices of all sorts of goods found in the labyrinth. Moreover, we were also keeping tabs on the import of marketable goods, as well as how we were going to sell them. This didn't seem like a first-time operation at all with how smoothly Myourmiles was handling it.

I had also introduced him to Veldora. Regarding the matter of opening up the takoyaki shop, Myourmiles was also willing to act as his consultant.

I made the right choice.

Among all the ideas that I came up with, it would seem that the appointment of Myourmiles had been my best decision yet. Without his help, these plans would most likely have ended in failure.

Just us alone would not have been sufficient to properly handle it.

To have met him under some miraculous twist of fate, how lucky of me.

I admired Myourmiles at work with delight.

![soft scene break]

Time passed fast.

![break]

The whole town was teeming with an atmosphere of festivity, full of enthusiasm and energy.

The construction plan of the colosseum was proceeding without a hitch as well, in part due to Gobkyu's leadership skills. In addition, the youngest of the three dwarf brothers, Mildo had returned from his vacation to help modify my blueprints. Thanks to his talent and input, the colosseum became a gorgeous building of great artistic value. As expected from a true artist, I was truly impressed. I personally was never really gifted in the art department, so he was a huge help. The end product would definitely be enough to even satisfy royalty. Regarding the additional parts Mildo added, we'd have it all done by the time the martial tournament started.

Moreover, Myourmiles's subordinates were attempting to set up stores using the hard-working citizens as their practice customers. That was going smoothly as well, and business seemed finer than ever.

Things should be fine then. Both Myourmiles and I were relieved.

![break]

The dungeon was handed over to Ramiris and Veldora. While I wanted to work on that too, I frankly didn't have the time.

To celebrate my inauguration---or just to check out who I really was, the representatives of the tribes in the Jura Great Forest began to gradually gather at this town.

Their goal was to pledge loyalty to the "demon lord" and stand under my protection. However, if they discovered that the demon lord didn't really have any real power, they would immediately bare their fangs and rebel. Staying by the side of a demon lord without power would not only do them no good, but it might even lead to their swift demise. As such, it was only natural to take the necessary actions to avoid such a reality.

![break]

Until now Jura Great Forest had always been under the protection of Veldora. This inviolable domain had now come to be ruled by a new demon Lord. Moreover, this demon lord had just come to power, so it was still a mystery as to what central ideology he upheld. This was the reason why the representatives of the tribes felt unease.

---And that's how things were as of now.

![break]

Today, I was dressed in formal attire and placed on an altar to be worshiped.

I was in my slime form, treated no different than a decorative ornament. It felt like I'd become kagami mochi^[This is a traditional Japanese New Year decoration (multiple food combined), it somewhat resembles Rimuru's slime shape.] offered on an altar. *Can't we just put my clone on it?* I tried to suggest this, and everyone shot me down with a smile. Times like these were when the executives were especially united. They probably made the decision behind my back using 'Telepathy Net'.

I was helplessly toyed with by them, and as a result I was so weighed down with decorations that I became basically immobile. They even specially prepared clothes (for slimes) on this day, to which all I could do was feel dumbfounded.

Not only that, but they also prepared several different types of outfits for each day. In the worst-case scenario, they would be changing my outfit every morning, noon, and night. I really hoped that they would show some restraint, but these people claimed that it was vital to make me look majestic... In other words, they were basically saying that the natural me---in slime form---had no majesty at all.

Right, never mind then.

![break]

As for the people attending the reception ceremony, everyone would be dressed like guards of honor. They were all fully armed, and unlike when they wear their normal clothes, their current attire held an air of prestige. Under this solemn atmosphere, Rigurd and Rigur, who were dressed in formal attire, were receiving the guests.

They told me that all I needed to do was remain silent and gaze down at the envoys. Since the magic of my appearance would be broken once I spoke, this suggestion was most appreciated.

Benimaru and Shuna flanked my left and right sides, respectively. Behind me, Shion, Souei, and Gabil stood in lines. Ranga was lurking in my shadow as always. On the right lane were the one hundred members of the goblin riders led by Gobta. On the left lane were the one hundred high ranked members of the Kurenai led by Gobua. The remaining two hundred lower ranked members were responsible for maintaining the security of the street. They were fiercer than the average security force, so even when encountering suspicious individuals, they should be able to handle it themselves. Plus, Shion's Yomigaeri were patrolling undercover in disguise across the town. Even if someone started a commotion there, they could respond to it before the situation spiraled out of control.

![exact fit image](image9)

On another note, Diablo and Hakurou had still yet to return from Farmus.

![break]

According to the ones that returned first, namely Gobta, Ranga, and Gabil, the two would be finishing their work at hand before the Founding Festival. They seemed to express regret at the fact that they wouldn't have a chance to see me in my "majestic" outfit. But they did have things to deal with on their side too, since Youm was soon going to be crowned. Once that happened the kingdom's name of Farmus would also disappear, and in its place a new kingdom would be born. That's why they seemed to be preoccupied with preparation work, so their inability to return was reasonable. Even Diablo had been so busy that he rarely showed up lately. As for Hakurou, since he didn't have the skill 'Spatial Movement', I hadn't been able to see him for a while either. When the two return, I shall make sure to reward them properly.

I wasn't the only one who had been working hard. Although my current state was extremely embarrassing, I'd have to endure it. I got the feeling that I should finish this reception ceremony as soon as possible.

![break]

The most interesting thing honestly was the reaction of the different tribes. While I served the role as a very "competent" decorative object with nothing else to do, I focused on observing the monsters coming to greet me---there were three types of reactions they were giving.

![break]

Reverence, observation, and fear.

![break]

In addition, among the people who were observing me, some even seemed to look down on us. It was an attitude often displayed by the newcomers from the opposite side of the Ameld river. It's not that big of a deal, and as long as I could show my strength, they would surely submit on the spot.

The problem lay with those who were afraid...

Right before me were people from a certain weak tribe whose expressions were filled with fear---the rabbitman tribe. They were cute looking demi-humans whose appearances closely resembled that of a human's, with the exception of their elongated, rabbit-like ears. Unlike the beastmen, the rabbitmen were an inferior species that couldn't use 'Transformation'. Their strength was no different from that of an average human, and judging from their equipment, they might even be considered weaker. But they still somehow managed to survive in the Jura Great Forest. It seemed that their 'Danger Perception' had been greatly enhanced, which was probably the reason why they weren't fooled by my appearance.

Dealing with people who feared me was most difficult. Some were even panicking. The priority here should be to calm them down first.

"T-Today...a-an honor to be invited---"

They were apparently so nervous that it gave them trouble speaking...

"It's fine. I permit you to meet with our ruler, the great Demon Lord Rimuru-sama. Please raise your head!" Rigurd spoke up, yet the rabbitman representative remained unresponsive. Actually, he didn't seem to be moving at all. Even with my cute slime appearance, he still didn't dare to raise his head to look at me. Meh. But I guess it was true that he couldn't make eye contact with me anyways since I didn't have any in the first place.

*Uh, maybe I'm stretching the topic. I don't intend to rule over others with fear, so I hope this misunderstanding can be resolved... However, to these people, the whole "This demon lord looks pretty weak"---is probably setting off every single one of their danger alarms.*

So this was the so-called fear due to Gap Moe^[This is an actual terminology. I cringed pretty hard when my editor pointed it out it was an actual thing (Cen note: this was present in Overlord LN as well. Supreme being Tabula Smaragdina was known for his obsession with Gap Moe, hence the creation of Albedo and her sister Nigredo)]. Simply getting them to agree to cooperate with us on maintaining their domain and sharing their culture took quite a lot of effort. While this cooperation might be a little forced, I hoped that in the future they would come to trust us.

When the Federation was first formed, we had to deal with something similar regarding the halfling and kobold (doghead race) tribes. When I allowed the kobold tribe to travel and do business with us, they began trusting us. Nowadays, their representative Kobe^[Previous volumes translate him also as "Coby".] had become a steadfast comrade, and we often exchanged profitable trade information.

Whether it was this rabbitman tribe or other weaker tribes---I would declare that all were equal under my rule. I didn't want to imitate other demon lords and their Social-Darwinist philosophy of "might makes right". I'd have to repeatedly bring up this point to hammer it in. It would be difficult to gain their trust immediately, but that would be a task for the future.

It seemed that I had gotten lost in my thoughts while staring at their rabbit ears. The rabbitmen right now were all groveling on their knees with their heads bowed.

"There's no need to be afraid. Rimuru-sama is a man of leniency. He has said that all who are willing to pledge their loyalty shall be equal before him. You can greet him with ease of mind."

After Rigurd said that, the representative was finally willing to lift his face.

He seemed quite young and had a handsome appearance, but dark circles hung under his eyes. Is it because he was working too hard or is it because he was too nervous...

"G-Great Demon Lord Rimuru-sama, please grant us rabbitmen the permission to pledge our loyalty to you---"

I nodded with a "Hmm" as he finished.

My reaction seemed to have eased their tension a bit; the young man's shoulders visibly sagged in relief.

"I've told you just now, there's no need to be so nervous."

"Y-Yes sir! I-In fact, I brought my daughter here too, but she was too excited when she reached the town, and by the time I realized it I'd already lost track of her..."

~~*(Gained Item: Spoiler-free ticket to read Mamono no Kuni no Arukikata, aka the bunny-girl spin-off manga---just kidding, keep reading the LN, no, don't leave, please.)*~~

![break]

"Hahaha, our town right now is alive and brimming with an atmosphere of festivity. She's a young lady after all, so her curiosity is only natural."

"Ahh, this is too embarrassing. My daughter is always giving me a headache as she would run off to different places as soon as I stopped paying attention. I was afraid that she would be an eyesore to your Majesty Rimuru, so I wanted to keep her at the village, but she kept begging me to bring her along..."

The tribe chief, who was also the representative, must've been very concerned about the disappearance of his daughter. Although she wouldn't run into any trouble in this town, he still seemed to be worried sick. I felt somewhat reassured to learn that I was not the source of his fear. I didn't want any weak tribes to be fearful of me anymore.

*By the way, a rabbitman lady...a beauty with rabbit ears... I've got to meet her sometime.*

While contemplating about the issue, I accidentally let out some of my genuine thoughts.

"Since she is so naturally curious, wouldn't she also be able to adapt to times of turbulence and change as well? She seems to show promise in growing to be a reliable successor."

Due to the fact that I personally spoke to him, the rabbitman representative looked deeply moved.

"Thank you for your gracious kindness. If the chance emerges next time, allow me to introduce my daughter Flamaire^[Or Flamea, Flavia (Seems like a translation mistake since her name is フラメア, not フラビア) as translated in the manga series "How the monster country works"] to you."

The chief bowed his head, which seemed to indicate that the awkward situation had been resolved. Afterwards, Rigurd went through some rough explanations on how things would work before the rabbitman tribe came to officially pledge allegiance to me. The chief bowed to me several times before he and his people departed off into the distance. By the looks of it, he would also inform the other tribes that I was no fearsome demon lord.

![break]

After being guided out, the next batch of visitors arrived.

I turned to face the monsters who were kneeling before me, requesting a meeting. Among them was a familiar face---Gabil's father---lizardman tribe leader Abil. Rather than feeling nostalgic, I got the feeling that he was a completely different person. Abil now looked like a warrior in the prime of his youth with a face full of energy. By the looks of it, due to me "Naming" him, Abil evolved. He had now evolved into a dragonewt that more closely resembled a human in appearance---but speaking of which, Gabil's appearance never experienced such a drastic change. His sister Souka evolved to obtain a human form too, so perhaps it had something to do with human will.

"Long time no see, Rimuru-sama. It is an occasion truly worth celebrating now that you've become a demon lord, I---No, we also..."

Abil's body tensed up due to nervousness. This must've been the feeling that came from deep reverence. Just as Gabil had mentioned before, demon lords were fearsome existences to both men and monsters. However, despite knowing my personality, he was still reacting this way...

That's why I decided to say something to break the ice.

"Ah, long time no see, Chief. You don't have to be so tense. We are all good pals within the federation after all, so I look forward to your guidance in the future as well."

Benimaru gave off a dry smile while Shuna let out an exasperated sigh, however, I didn't really mind.

"No, that can't be right. Right now Rimuru-sama has become a demon lord, so things are totally different. As long as you are our leader, you are in effect the dominator of the Jura Great Forest..."

*Abil was still the same as always, so serious all the time.*

*But that's also why he's so likable.*

"Ah, it's all right. There's no other tribe present here, so you don't have to be so stiff. Chief, your son Gabil has been working hard under me. He's now an official and plays an integral part in our community."

I decided to bring up Gabil's name so Abil wouldn't feel the need to be so tense.

I also emphasized the parent-child relationship between Abil and Gabil, hinting that it was time for him to make amends with Gabil.

"Geez, seriously. I've been defeated, Rimuru-sama. Gabil, that kid... Has my son been of service to you? He really is my hopeless, silly son..."

Abil nodded with gratitude, seemingly sensing my intention. On the surface, Gabil and Abil had cut ties with each other. Since Abil thought he shouldn't publicly display concern about Gabil's wellbeing, he didn't bring that topic up. However, once I started it, he no longer felt reservations and continued the conversation. It seemed like he'd finally eased into it, once again displaying his heroic characteristics.

"Not at all. He is now working very hard and is in charge of the entire research department. Ain't that right, Gabil?"

"Huh? Ah, yeah!"

During my conversation with Abil, Gabil had stood frozen on the side this entire time without saying a word. He seemed embarrassed to the point where even his ears were blushing red. His voice even jumped up a pitch after I called him out.

"This silly boy..."

While ignoring the panicked Gabil, I let a little bit of my 'Demon Lord Haki' leak out. This act alone turned the atmosphere solemn.

"Leader of the lizardman tribe, Abil, I hope you will assist me, the demon lord, as a member of the federation."

"Understood! I swear by my 'Name' that I shall pledge my eternal loyalty to Rimuru-sama!"

Abil got down onto his knees and bowed, declaring his loyalty with conviction. The way he made his declaration was quite warrior like, resulting in a glorious display. I nodded towards him as my gaze fell onto Gabil, who was still in a state of panic.

"---Uh!"

*Gabil sure is slow. Apparently, he didn't understand what my glance meant. But slimes don't even have eyes---though that is probably not the reason.*

Rigurd, who could no longer bear to watch, made a move as he whispered to Gabil, "Rimuru-sama hopes that you and your father can have a good chat together to close the gap between you two. If you don't take this chance right now to mend your relationship, opportunities are going to be hard to come by in the future. Moreover, Abil-dono will be put in a difficult spot if he has severed ties with an executive---"

Rigurd knew his stuff, all right. Unlike Gabil, he had completely understood the meaning behind my words. After Rigurd pointed this out, Gabil seemed to have finally understood the situation. He hurriedly bowed and accompanied Abil in leaving our location.

![break]

Next in line were the chiefs of each high orc clan who came to greet me with several subordinates. They must have put a lot of faith in us seeing that they didn't even bring any guards.

The subordinates were their children. The improvement in the food shortage situation was only natural, and even their lives as a whole had been improved.

The most important thing, for them, was the birth of new children. Rumor had it that the fact that the newborns were also high orcs upon birth gave them a pleasant surprise, which is why they decided to report this to me in person.

*Isn't it normal for the high orcs to have high orc children?* I thought so too, but it turned out to not be the case. Under normal circumstances, the high orcs would only give birth to regular orc children; the mutation was only limited to one generation. Due to the declining birth rate, they must've been putting more effort into raising their young. I hoped that this was indeed the case as more children would lead to more future labor for our nation.

*Children are precious. Even in a different world, with a different race, this is still the unwavering truth*. I was somewhat worried about the name inheritance, but it sounded like things went surprisingly well. Even though the names I gave them were randomly made up, and they had now gotten a bit complex... But they seemed to think that those types of names were perfectly normal.

Wonderful, wonderful.

While I believed this to be the case, it might just be that they had gotten used to their names. After being addressed with these names all the time, it naturally became the norm. They never had a problem with being unnamed in the past, so it seemed like I was worrying too much.

I heaved a sigh of relief and ended the reception ceremony with the high orcs.

![break]

Finally the last group of people for today. Apart from the lizardmen and high orcs, there was one last major faction of the Jura Great Forest left---the treants^[DnD race of essentially "Tree People"] had also come to greet me.

With that being said however, the only people who were actually here were Treyni-san's two sisters, the dryads Trya and Doris. But since the treants were immobile, this couldn't really be helped. Moreover, the dryads were the representatives of tree people anyways, so it didn't really matter that they weren't personally present.

Speaking of the tribe of the treants, I often visited the place since Zegion and Apito guarded them. Not only did they guard the tribe, but they also delivered high quality honey to me. It was probably due to these reasons that the reception atmosphere was pretty relaxed.

"It's been a while, Rimuru-sama. We've come to congratulate you on your inauguration as demon lord."

"Please continue to protect us in the future."

The two weren't holding back either as they greeted me with all smiles. This was good for me as well. We began to chat about our recent conditions, and so far, there didn't seem to be any major problems at hand. If anything, the magicule density in the Jura Great Forest had thinned out, and as a result, movement had become somewhat more inconvenient.

It was as if the two were made from the same mold that birthed Treyni-san. They exuded the usual aura characteristic of an abundance of powerful mana. But the reduction of magicule concentration did still have an effect on them. In fact, the body of this Doris in front of me had become more transparent.

"I see...that part is my miscalculation. It's probably because of the 'Barrier' applied on the roads. I gotta figure out a solution..."

"Ah, it's fine. It's not that big of a deal."

"It's just that us sisters are affected because we utilize 'Magic Body' made by magicules that are susceptible to environmental changes."

"Speaking of which, Rimuru-sama---"

"We have some urgent matters!"

They claimed that the reduction in magicule concentration was nothing significant.

Monsters being affected by the thinning of magicule density was very rare, but the dryads, who fed off magicules, mainly had their lives tied to the treants. Since they were the last group of people I planned to meet for the day, I decided on a change of venue to continue our discussion.

I arranged another place to meet them that evening...

.........

......

...

It was nighttime, and as soon as I entered the room---

"The thing that we really wanted to discuss was---"

"We want to follow nee-san's footsteps to serve the beautiful fairy queen."

The two spoke at the same time. At this point, my mind was still stuck on the title "Fairy Queen". That's quite the dramatic name that didn't suit that chibi at all. Also, the term beautiful was just...

Ramiris's innocent smile crossed my mind. No way; there's no such thing.

*My impression of her, compared to those two's, couldn't have been more different; that I am absolutely certain of. If Ramiris is considered beautiful, then my appearance that resembles Shizu-san can only be described as godly. Even though I've begun to get used to looking at it lately, I still occasionally get mesmerized when looking at myself.*

Not only me, but Benimaru and Shion by my side also shared the same sentiments. However, Trya and Doris seemed oblivious about it.

"It isn't just our hope, it's what all the treants desire as well."

"We heard that this town---"

"Ramiris-sama has moved and settled here."

"If that's the case, we hope to contribute our fair share of effort in serving her Majesty..." the two talked in turns, either about following my leadership or about serving Ramiris. How could I take these people as subordinates when they were shouting about pledging loyalty to someone else? Seriously. Well, I guess since their sister Treyni-san was already serving Ramiris, I didn't really have any reason to object.

"Then, would you guys want to ask her directly in person?"

"---EH?"

"Can we really?"

The two reacted quite enthusiastically.

![break]

As such, we walked together to where Ramiris was. Beretta was working quietly on something while Treyni-san was busy tending to Ramiris. Ah, Beretta seemed to be buried beneath a mountain of work.

I thought to myself, while on the other hand---

"AH! Ramiris-sama is indeed beautiful---"

"She is beautiful and noble as always. There is indeed no other who could be our master!"

They were just like this before, and as soon as they saw Ramiris, Trya and Doris went full fangirl and began to cry out in excitement.

Treyni-san saw this and nodded in acknowledgement. Who were these people talking about? I was completely baffled. Especially the part about "noble quality". Because no matter how you put it, Ramiris seemed to be quite lacking in that regard.

"Did you hear that? Hey! I'm talking to you, you know! Didn't you hear what they just said? Are you going to see me in a different light now?"

I saw that Ramiris was once again being cocky and acting boastful.

How troublesome. She was even flying around me looking all delighted, almost as if saying: "How 'bout that!"

Never mind, I didn't wanna deal with her anyways. It was indeed something to be happy about when you got praised...but she was seriously taking it way too far.

"How do you see it, Ramiris? Not only these two, but the entire tribe of treants wishes to serve you!"

"Uhmm, but..."

She seemed to be aware that she was a guest who was just temporarily staying here as she looked around, indecisive. That's why I decided to lend her a hand.

"How about moving them into your labyrinth? Since you could move the shelter of the beastmen with ease, surely, it'll be a piece of cake to move the treant tribe, right?"

Or perhaps it was too hard due to the distance involved? But I recalled that she mentioned something about the labyrinth being connected to all parts of the world...

"Can I? Then we'll have them move in tomorrow! With the power of my mentor, expansion of the labyrinth is super easy! I feel like my power has increased as well. There are still empty floors right now, so perhaps it'll be a great idea to turn one of them into a forest!"

Ramiris accepted my proposal with joy all over her face.

"With the power of her mentor"---that line kind of concerned me, but whatever, that'll do.

"But we are residents of the Jura Great Forest, so shouldn't we follow Rimuru-sama...?"

Although, I still had some reservations about it. Even Treyni-san seemed to be concerned, though her facial expression said otherwise. I could tell that she wanted to live with her sisters as well.

As I stated several times: I personally didn't object. In fact, the interior of the labyrinth was the domain of Ramiris. The region managed by me and the residence of Ramiris coexisted at the same time. This was the so-called special zone. It was why the area run by Ramiris inside the labyrinth could enjoy extraterritorial judiciary.

I explained the matter to them and told them that I wouldn't hold them accountable for anything if they migrated now, since Ramiris's subordinates were immortal inside the labyrinth. Moreover, I thought it best for them to serve their original master, so I suggested.

"We treants and dryads hope to move here and seek the protection of Ramiris-sama."

"We know that this is sudden, but will you grant us your permission?" Trya and Doris requested. And without a doubt, I granted permission.

![break]

And just like that, the plan to move the treant tribe into Ramiris' labyrinth had been approved. They'd live on floor 95, which was currently serving as the shelter for the beastmen. This dome-shaped floor was the largest of its kind, with a diameter spanning five kilometers, offering plenty of space. Another reason was that I was planning to make that level a resting zone anyway, and this just happened to help make things smoother. After all, we already had the so-called forest hot spring, so the resting area couldn't be too shabby either.

![break]

The issue concerning their migration was settled quickly. Ramiris went to where the treants lived and created a new labyrinth gate to directly move the entire tribe inside. Since the treants traveled exceedingly slowly, she opened up a gate in front of every individual treant in order to speed things along.

And with that, Ramiris got a bunch of new subordinates. They even helped to stabilize the interior of the labyrinth as well. Managing the magicule concentration and the air conditioning had also become easier... Not only that, but the treants seemed to also be content with their living conditions. The increased magicule concentration had made everyone livelier.

As for the beastmen who were temporarily residing there, they didn't seem to care much about it either. The treants were all very well-behaved people, spending most of their time sleeping. In addition, they looked no different from normal trees, so it was no wonder why no one minded. The beastmen would have to return to Eurazania someday, so sharing their residence wouldn't really bother them. With a more comfortable living environment, chances were high that they'd actually come to welcome the treants instead.

The dryads also agreed to work on managing the labyrinth. Well, I should say that they were more like volunteers instead of workers.

"We after all have the honor to build an amusement park here, so it is an easy task."

Since Treyni-san put it that way, her sisters, and the rest of the dryads had no objections. Now we got some unexpected assistance.

.........

......

...

And so, a small forest had been added inside the labyrinth.

![break]

Floor 95 ended in a five, making it a safe zone. Plus, we still had some empty floors left, so we turned levels 91 to 94 into warehouses, flower beds, or processing factories. To be more specific, level 91 would be a warehouse for iron ore, level 92 the manufacturing factory that refined the ore to magisteel, level 93 the flower beds, and level 94 would be the honey processing plant.

Anyone from level 95 could directly reach these floors with ease due to convenient transportation. There was a save point in the center, adjacent to it were gates that lead to different floors as well as stairs to go to lower levels. It was thanks to the fact that the labyrinth completely negated the laws of physics that we got such a convenient structure.

As soon as someone defeated the boss at level 90, the stairs to level 95 would immediately appear. We all agreed that there was no harm in letting the people that had made it to that point take a little shortcut if they so desired.

![break]

After which---

From floor 96 onwards was a grueling series of the most challenging, hellish levels. Before attempting them, adventurers needed to take a rest and inspect their equipment. We didn't forget to set up gates and caution signs before the stairs leading to the lower levels. We also opened inns, as well as weapon and gear stores surrounding the gate. The inns had gates leading to all the safe zones. That made it very convenient in times like these.

Now let's check out the stores selling weapons and gear. During their opening hours, the shops would only display the rare equipment exclusive to the labyrinth. I didn't think we'd have too many customers, so they'd most likely become stores for the blacksmithing enthusiasts.

*Should I sneak one of my own works onto the shelf as well?* While daydreaming about this, I decided to discuss the plan with Myourmiles. And that's how it was. After the end of today's reception ceremony, I suddenly became the lil' helper for Ramiris and her men to migrate.

![break]

This floor would later become a forest city. Only people who had weathered through the trials of the dungeon would be able to gain access here and take a rest to receive some motivation, for further adventure of course---this so called "City of the Labyrinth" would become a prosperous city of fantasy.

![break]

With that being said---at the time, I had not foreseen that at all.

![soft scene break]

The next day.

![break]

According to today's schedule, we seemed to be starting off with stronger species. These were the most powerful bunch among the new-comers; therefore I could expect some more intense stares to be directed at me while being observed---as if on cue, there was already a commotion taking place outside.

Members of two different tribes showed signs of starting a conflict with each other. Shuna frowned unpleasantly at the sight while Shion widened her eyes, forcing herself to endure her anger.

*Geez, I hope things can be settled peacefully...*

The people visiting were the ox-head (gozu) and horse-face (mezu) tribes^[Gozu and Mezu are respectively referring to "Ox-head" and "Horse-face" which are both creatures from Japanese legends.]. Both sides brought around ten young warriors who were already engaging in a standoff. It was said that both tribes had been engaged in perpetual battles against each other for over a hundred years without ever reaching a point of reconciliation.

The reason they were arguing this time was probably to determine who got to go in first for the reception. Perhaps they thought that whoever came first would get the upper hand, but I was determined to stay out of this mess no matter what. The day had barely started, and I'd already gotten a headache. With their relationship being this tense, I was honestly worried about them kicking off a brawl any moment. They attempted to pull each other back as they moved in front of me. Naturally for the high-ranked tribes in the Jura Great Forest, their strength was reflected in their arrogance.

The majin with ox horns was the first to speak.

"Yo, Demon Lord-sama, we are the ones that will be of real use on the battlefield! With us Gozu tribe in your alliance, we can definitely stand tall in this forest! If we eliminate those weaklings from the mezu tribe, no other race in this forest can stand against us!"

As expected from a race with impressive strength, not only was he not afraid of me, he even began to brag. Actually, compared to the ogre tribe and lizardmen tribe in the past, they did possess a higher magicule content. Just giving them a more careful look revealed that several of them were already at Rank A. It was no wonder that they were able to continue a war for as long as a hundred years. Based on combat capabilities alone, they may indeed have been the strongest in Jura Great Forest...

Before I could make any response, the mezu majin began to shout angrily as well, "Hmph, bunch of fools! If you are a demon lord, surely you have a grander vision. So do not hesitate and collaborate with us Mezu tribe. Let us slaughter not only these gozu, but any monster who dares to defy us."

Both of them were spouting unreasonable nonsense and their type of explosive personality already had me frustrated. It seemed that the rabbitmen who weren't fooled by my appearance turned out to be more distinguished.

*But, hold on a sec?*

*They are indeed irritating, but upon seeing these guys, an idea suddenly popped into my head. Honestly, whenever we think about a labyrinth, the first thing that comes to people's mind should be "Minotaur".*

*In Greek mythology, there was a famous ox-head labyrinth monster called the Minotaur---people thought that it was a legend or a fable passed on by generations, yet in the early twentieth century, they actually dug up the Knossos palace on the island Crete. The palace had a complex interior structure with its basement resembling a labyrinth.*

*Anyway, putting aside whether the Minotaur actually existed or not, the palace was supposedly filled with various paintings depicting an ox---that's how the Minotaur became the iconic staple of any self-respecting dungeon. It must be my lucky day, because the gozu race, resembling the Minotaur from people's fantasies, is just the thing our labyrinth was lacking!*

Upon seeing the giant creature that was likely their leader, *isn't he a good candidate for that?* I thought to myself.

The weakest part of our dungeon was the selection of bosses. Right now we had only captured some rather impressive monsters and placed them at levels 10, 20 and 30. This gozu guy would be most suited to defend levels 40 to 50---that's how I see it.

I would love to appoint him a boss on some floor---such thoughts continued to pour out of my mind. But reality is often disappointing. These monsters didn't seem to have much loyalty towards me. At most they were thinking: "This guy could be a pretty good employer." Moreover, their intention of using me to eliminate their rival was obvious. They could be of so much use if they just behaved themselves a little. Such were my honest opinions.

That's why I decided to activate some of my 'Demon Lord Haki'. I hoped that they would realize how strong I was and pledge their allegiance---eh, it flew over their heads completely. They continued to argue against each other right in front of me... Although it would be quite rude, should I perhaps dull their spirits a bit so I can recruit them?

![break]

I was just about to put that thought into action---

"You punks, how dare you act so rude in front of our king. I, Rigurd shall show you all your places!"

While flexing his muscles, Rigurd stepped forward. While he usually treated people kindly and actively attended to national affairs in town, I knew that he had been secretly working out. In fact, he had already outperformed youngsters such as Gobta and Rigur. He even volunteered himself for the fight against the Holy Knights---he clearly had an aggressive side. I was confident that he could beat the leaders of these two tribes.

"What did you just say? How can a mere civil official be so pompous!"

"You're just a lackey of some weakling demon lord, quit bluffing now!"

The two leaders rebuked, the rest of the youngsters responding in a similar manner. They'd been underestimating me before as well, the only people to be so pompous were them. All I needed to do was release some of my 'Demon Lord Haki' and any monsters who encountered me until now had obeyed nicely. These people however were clearly itching for a fight and totally lacked awareness of their situation.

Rather than fearing me, it was better that you looked down on me since it was easier to deal with that way. But I might have to reevaluate my policy now that they'd crossed the line. Surely, they would settle down once we roughed them up a bit.

Rigurd was looking at me. As I was about to grant him permission---

"What is that!"

"...This is..."

"---Geez, there seems to be something troublesome?"

"Hmph, it's probably nothing."

A shockingly imposing sensation was emitting from outside the town. The 'Barrier' constructed by Shuna had been shattered, followed by monsters with immense youki and large pools of magicule appearing---no, they were majins.

From the hostility they were giving off alone, it was evident that they'd not come in peace. Even the gozu and mezu tribes, who didn't notice my 'Demon Lord Haki', turned pale immediately after sensing this.

"S-Such power---"

"Hold up, hold up hold up now, Demon Lord-sama, could it be that the other demon lords have invaded...?" the gozu and mezu tribesmen started to shiver after saying so. Before this, Jura Great Forest had always been under the protection of the pact formed by the demon lords. The reason they were so conceited was because they'd never seen the world beyond here. They were forced to reevaluate their own abilities upon facing a real threat.

Although the romantic concept of a Minotaur boss was one of my top priorities, I suddenly got bigger fish to fry.

I immediately used 'Transformation' to turn into my human form and told Benimaru and the rest: "Let's go".

"Yes sir!"

"Understood."

As I heard everyone's response, I headed straight towards the direction of that powerful aura.

.........

......

...

Upon arriving at the scene, there were around ten members from the Kurenai surrounding the three men responsible. A couple of guards, gate keepers and members of Yomigaeri were lying on the ground. Ah, Gobjay was there too. He seemed to have done his best, but running straight at these intruders was just reckless.

The people who weren't injured were assisting the townsfolk and guests to take shelter. They had received training on how to handle emergencies, so things were going smoothly without stirring up too much chaos. The fact that anyone got hurt kind of pissed me off anyway.

I turned to the three culprits. One of them was a slim and tall, polite-looking man who wore an earring. There was also a brawny man with bulky muscles who wore a nose-ring. And the last one had quite a large build; he was a short and plump man who wore a mouth-ring. Their hairstyles were all very bizarre, each of them a different color. "Like delinquents with dyed hair"---that's a rather appropriate metaphor for the trio.

"Who the hell are you people, have you come to cause trouble knowing that this is Demon Lord Rimuru-sama's domain?" Shion, who followed after me, demanded from them. In response, the earring guy stepped forward with a smile.

"Get lost and out of my way. I've got no interest in scrubs. I was planning to kill that Clayman to take the demon lord seat, but it looks like someone screwed that up for me and now I'm quite pissed about it. I don't do needless killing, but if anyone dares to get in my way, I won't be so nice no more!"

His attitude was rude and imposing, but given the sights of the people lying on the ground, none of their lives were taken. Considering the difference in magicule storage, not even a Yomigaeri would survive if he really did intend to kill them. His claim about not doing needless killing was apparently true.

It seemed that I may have judged them too harshly based on appearance alone, they were not as wicked as I imagined. But since they'd come to stir up trouble, we would have to strike back. Especially at times like this when we were hosting the demon lord inauguration. The Founding Festival was drawing nearer, many merchants from various nations were already visiting. Causing a commotion in these delicate times wasn't something I'd punish lightly...

What a troublesome affair, but it cannot be helped. I shall take them on myself then---

"Rimuru-sama, please hold on. Leave this to me."

As I was about to act, Shion spoke up to stop me. Benimaru wanted to go first too, but after his eyes met with Shion's, they seemed to have decided the sequence of their showdown. Benimaru probably conceded because Shion's subordinates were beaten by them.

"Oh, are you Demon Lord Rimuru's entourage? My old man has told me about you, aren't you the female kijin that beat the shit out of that asshole Clayman? How interesting. You'll get me warmed up---"

"Hold on, big bro. The demon lord is all yours, so at least spare some of his entourages for us."

"Mmm-Mmmhmm, that's right. My tummy is hungry too, so even one is fine."

The three of them were apparently brothers. The eldest brother was the one wearing the earring, the other two were his younger brothers. However, not only did their father tell them about me, they had even heard of the battle between Clayman and Shion. In other words, the father of these guys was either a demon lord or someone close to a demon lord. All three possessed magicule to rival that of un-awakened Clayman, it was likely that they were sons of a demon lord.

*Then, who would that be...? Guy, Milim, Ramiris, Luminas---it's definitely not these four. Dagruel, Dino and Leon, is it one of them---Dino and Leon are unlikely as well, does this perhaps leave Dagruel to be our prime suspect?*

As thoughts swirled in my mind, Shion stepped forward.

"Silence. We are busy hosting the reception ceremony for Rimuru-sama, so time is precious. Let me take on the three of you altogether."

"Ah?"

"Oi oi oi, are you looking down on us?"

"I was going to hold back since you are a woman, but never mind that. You gonna cry, you definitely gonna cry."

"Mm-Mmmhmm, my tummy just reacted to your words a bit. Now I can get the grand meal I've been missing to fill my stomach."

Shion's words caused me to gasp out of surprise. No matter how you put it, it was still a stretch for Shion alone to take on three persons beyond her ability at once. I was going to stop her, but she had already been angered, so there's nothing I could do to stop her now.

Why is Shion so heated today...

"B-Benimaru-kun?"

"Just let Shion do her thing. She does a better job than me at holding back."

...

The swiftness of Benimaru's answer made me speechless. If that's the case, I'd just have to give up. I let Shion do whatever she wanted and hoped for the best.

The town must not get destroyed. I suggested changing the venue, surprisingly the three agreed without hesitation. They observed the city's appearance with intrigue as I guided them to the recently constructed colosseum.

"Hey, woman, I admire your boldness, I'll let it slide if you retract your words right now!"

Shion sneered at the suggestion of the earring dude. She went as far as to provoke the trio with a hard-boiled statement erupting from her hot-blooded spirit that came out of nowhere, "I'll give you a lesson on how one's combat prowess is not determined by the amount of magicule they have!"

A lively crowd had already gathered to relish the battle breaking out between the trio, who just came to settle a score with the demon lord, and Shion.

![break]

---The result was the overwhelming victory of Shion.

![break]

The fat man with a mouth-ring was unexpectedly agile, launching himself like a cannon ball at Shion in a manner unbefitting for his build. Unfazed by this, Shion countered it with a roundhouse kick and sent him hurling towards the earring guy. Using this moment as an opening, while the nose-ring guy was speechless at the sight, she snuck in to grab his arm and collar to deliver an over-shoulder throw. Nose-ring guy's head smashed squarely onto the stone pavement---he wasn't going to get up anytime soon.

"UHHHH, how dare you harm my bro!"

The mouth-ring guy sprang up from behind and tried to grab and lock her, yet Shion's superhuman strength would not allow him to do anything of the sort.

"W-What the hell! Am I not the stronger one..."

While glaring down at the shocked mouth-ring guy, Shion laughed with disdain. She turned around to face the fellow and began to twist his arms, testing his strength.

"Agh, GUGIGIGIGIGI..."

*Snap*

How pitiful, the two arms of the mouth-ring guy were folded into an abnormal angle, though since this guy was a monster, I'm sure he'll be fine. He was obviously in a lot of pain though, so he must've suffered heavy damage. Yet Shion wouldn't even give him another look before finishing him off with her iron fist. The mouth-ring guy didn't even have time to lament before Shion punched the living soul out of him.

It was then that a strong kick was launched by the ear-ring guy, Shion narrowly dodged it by leaning back slightly. However, a grin emerged on the ear-ring guy's face as he stopped his leg.

*Danger*---as the thought crossed my mind, it was already too late, the leg that the ear-ring guy just stopped midair rushed downward like a vicious axe in an attempt to crush Shion's head.

*Thump*! A heavy sound was made. Yet Shion's head was hard as a rock, breaking ear-ring guy's foot instead. Shion then launched a low sweep kick to break his other leg, forcing the ear-ring guy to collapse onto the ground. She crossed her legs over him to sit on his body and proceeded to lay down a series of punches without mercy.

![break]

As such, Shion emerged victorious. She didn't even have the chance to unsheathe her beloved sword Hercules Ex before giving the three a beatdown. Her power had obviously increased. She had beaten opponents with a higher magicule pool than her without even getting tired. Plus, she took care of three in one go, how terrifying.

"B-Benimaru-kun? Shion is---"

"Yes, it is quite astounding all right. But it seems that she has mastered the way of controlling her strength."

*Eh, that's not the issue at all!*

*This isn't Milim we are talking about here, where is this strength even coming from? Benimaru's view seems pretty strange, but that's not what I wanted to talk about... Never mind, there's no use saying anything more.*

By the way, Shion, she was truly strong. From this fight, it was proven that by utilizing mana in a different way, even when you are confronted by a rival on par in strength, you can still defeat them with ease. The experience she gained from giving Clayman a beat down must have helped her improve greatly.

Benimaru also believed that this was only natural as he seemed unfazed after witnessing the scene. Although I still couldn't quite accept it, Shion had brawled with an ex-demon lord after all. I suppose that Benimaru and maybe even both Souei and Geld could do the same.

No no no, I was definitely thinking too much. I seemed to have been overwhelmed after witnessing Shion's growth.

![break]

"Pardon me, is this still not enough?"

I wasn't sure whether she had misunderstood the shock in my heart or not, Shion slanted her eyes at the trio lying on the ground. I immediately replied, "No no no, that's plenty!" to stop her. *How is it not enough, you are actually being excessive.*

"Now that you've learnt your lesson, you better not bother us ever again! Also, the other demon lords are less forgiving than me, so don't try your luck with them," I told the trio, who were still unable to get up after getting punished by Shion's iron fists. The nose-ring guy who had regained consciousness nodded heavily in response. This advice was for their own good, after all. These people seemed to have gotten full of themselves to have attempted to challenge a demon lord. It was fortunate that they came to me. If it was any other demon lord, they might have suffered more than they just did at the hands of Shion.

"She's stronger than how the old man put it..."

It seemed that they've woken up as the ear-ring guy whispered.

"Big bro, that would mean Demon Lord Rimuru is---"

"Yep, he's gotta be stronger."

"Mmm-mmmHmm, I'm so hungry."

The three started to look at me with respect. One of them acted pretty weird, but I shouldn't really think too much of it.

"So, who sent you guys?"

I didn't want any more trouble, so I decided to clarify the relations behind them. If they were willing to tell me honestly---I didn't expect this concern of mine to be resolved as well.

"Yes Sir! We are the sons of Demon Lord Dagruel. I'm his eldest son Dagura."

"I am his second son Liura."

"I am the third son Debura!"

The three decided to spill the beans altogether without hesitation. As I expected, they were indeed Demon Lord Dagruel's sons.

"Oi oi oi, you just admitted it so fast like that, is that really okay?"

"Yeah. In fact our old man wanted us to go train under Demon Lord Rimuru."

"We were just messing around for a bit, but he lost his temper big time..."

"Hmmhmm, we were chased out by dad!"

*Why are you admitting everything now, also, excuse me what? So to put it simply, he couldn't discipline his delinquent sons and decided to push the babysitting work to me? Dagruel you bastard! We aren't even that close; how dare you make this decision without asking for permission...*

*But, isn't it not half bad to sell him a favor first? Our faction has yet to have a firm stand yet, we don't intend to antagonize an established faction at this point of time. I personally think they are quite troublesome, but there happens to be the devil of a drill sergeant Shion. I've seen her training for Gobjay and the others, her methods were crueler than Hakurou, even I was a bit terrified.*

*If I hand these guys to Shion, they will eventually run away after they can't bear it. When they leave by themselves, I would have done my part as well. Then Dagruel won't have any basis to complain about this to me, no problemo.*

"All right, then you guys can go train with Shion," I declared, turning to Shion. She probably didn't want to take them, but I had already tossed the conversation to her.

Unexpectedly, Shion nodded to me with an evil grin.

---Eh? Her reaction was different than I expected?

"Hehehe, just now, Rimuru-sama has appointed me, Shion. Even softies like you three can more or less have some growth in my hands and turn into first-class warriors. Just rest assured and follow my lead!"

"Yes ma'am, that's just what we want!"

"Understood! Allow us to follow big sis's lead and work hard!"

"I wanna too! But before that, please give me something to eat!"

Surprisingly enough, Shion took on the job eagerly. It was great that she had no objection, so I'd just go with her flow. Then we left Shion with the trio and returned to the reception hall.

There seemed to be voices coming from behind my back---"Sensei, actually, allow me to call you master!^[Shishou 師匠]", "Hmm, you guys, remember to follow my teaching well!"... *Best that I pretend not to hear them.*

.........

......

...

Back at the reception hall, I saw the gozu and mezu tribesmen kneeling there, shivering with pale faces. The youngsters who were brought along all imitated the leaders and bowed their heads on their knees. Their previous arrogance was gone without a trace, and they looked awfully powerless now as if they were some pathetic tribes from some backwater.

"W-We humbly await your Majesty's return!"

"We've decided to pledge our loyalty to Demon Lord Rimuru-sama!"

*What type of emotional rollercoaster have you guys been through?* Their attitudes were completely different from before.

I returned to my throne and turned back to a slime. I thought that they were going to switch back to the conceited attitude, but there didn't seem to be any sign of that.

"You guys serious?"

"O-Of course!"

"Please command us at will!"

It seemed that they had really changed their minds. They were trying very hard, seemingly to get on my good side from the bottom of their heart. I see. After witnessing the commotion just now, they must've found Shion quite terrifying.

Then there was no need to be courteous with these people. Now I could use them to whatever end I wanted. After all, they'd been fighting a war for over a hundred years and were troublesome tribes. They must've really enjoyed combat, if that were the case, surely, they would not complain to have the inside of the labyrinth as their battlefield. I heard that they would even rob weaker species and commit other bad deeds, so everyone would be happy if I quarantined these people.

"I see that you guys seem to be full of energy, how about I help you all prepare a stage to fight on."

"Ehh, are you forgiving them? I was going to punish these people in Rimuru-sama's place..." Rigurd's reply was tinged with regret after hearing my words.

The commotion they just caused had been resolved like this, but Rigurd seemed to be dissatisfied. With that being said, since I had already taken in these people, I might as well give them the chance to work for me. It was better that way.

"Geez, don't get mad, Rigurd. In my eyes these people were just being ignorant. So don't fuss with them over this one incident. I'll leave things in your care if these people underestimate me again."

"Since you've spoken, I don't have any objection. You guys are really lucky. If Rimuru-sama were any less gracious of a ~~slime~~ man, you would have already been taken care of! If you dare to defy again, it will be your demise. Consider this as a lesson to reflect and learn restraint in life."

Fortunately, Rigurd seemed to have accepted it.

"Count yourself lucky today, if not for the commotions just now, not only Rigurd-san, I would have struck too. The balls you had to say those distasteful words, I planned to cut out your tongues so you couldn't say such grotesque things anymore. You guys need to appreciate Rimuru-sama's kindness and work hard from now on."

I wasn't able to reply before Shion suddenly piped up. The gozu and mezu tribesmen nodded heavily while shivering.

![break]

" " "W-We will not fail your expectations! That's why, we hope that you can forgive us for our offense!" " "

![break]

Seeing how unanimously they declared that, surely, they wouldn't dare to defy us ever again.

"Since you've pledged allegiance to me, I can consider promoting you guys. But first you need to stop causing conflicts with others. You have to behave yourselves under my order."

Although I wasn't required to make this warning myself, this was my ultimatum for them. I'd find one of the gozu leaders later and negotiate to have them work at the labyrinth. Now things were going smoothly again. I uncaringly threatened them and admonished them hard. These people should obey nicely now.

*It looks like I'll be getting my Minotaur after all. This incident has left me overjoyed to the point that it relieved the built-up stress and exhaustion from the past couple of days.*

![soft scene break]

After that, the reception continued smoothly. The news of Shion taming the sons of Dagruel had spread and seeing how the powerful races of gozu and mezu were in fear, there were no other races that dared to look down on me. I hoped this would continue until the end of the reception ceremony...

![break]

In front of me was the elder of the elven tribe---who appeared to be a youth in his prime no matter how I saw it---he also brought several servants. Not one of them was female, which was a pity since the elven females were usually beauties to behold.

Basically, the elves were a species with a long lifespan.

Spirits after becoming materialized---or perhaps fallen---would turn into fairies and possess a body. They were the ancestors of elves and dwarves. A Race such as the goblins were also distant relatives of ancient fairies.

The ones possessing "Earth" element became dwarves, "Water" element became mermaids, "Fire" element became goblins, and "Wind" element became elves. These were all results of crossbreeding between ancient fairies and other races that made up their ancestors.

The Goblins were the species with the thinnest bloodline which made their lifespan shortest. It was about the same for their evolved race of ogre. Their lifespan was around a hundred years. Upon evolving to kijin, the power possessed by their spirit ancestors would be awakened. They then got to utilize powerful skills such as Psychic Power^[神通力 I'm still not very sure what this power/ability the author is referring to, so I'll adhere to the last volume and call this "psychic power" as I've seen such explanation in Japanese dictionary.].

Back to the topic of elves. It was said that they could live up to five hundred to eight hundred years. Even human half-breeds could still live for nearly three hundred years. Basically, the lifespan of each elf varied greatly in accordance to how much fairy blood flowed through their veins... They would not age any further after living twenty odd years into adulthood. Around twenty years before their natural lifespan expired, they rapidly began aging until the day they died.

They enjoyed hundreds of years of youth, which to humans made them appear like a fairytale species. Notable however was their low fertility rate, likely due to their longevity, they lacked the desire to pass on generations. As a result, they were few in number.

This was all the information I learned from the ladies at the Dwarven Kingdom night shop---Night Butterfly, although I wasn't sure whether it's true or not.

By the way, fairies still existed as their own species. They were not even rare, but in fact a very common type of monster. They were about the same size as Ramiris and enjoyed pranks. They evolved from lesser spirits due to the influence of magicules. While they did possess intelligence, they were limited to one generation of descendants and had very short lifespans. While they were all fairies, these ones couldn't rival those evolved (materialized) from greater spirits, so they were categorized as two different types of monsters.

Some people often mixed Ramiris up with this type of fairy, but in reality, they were not the same creature. She fell from the high-ranked species of Spirit Queen, which was likely far more advanced than the ancestors of elves and dwarves. Ramiris apparently reincarnated a lot, so I probably couldn't get an answer even if I asked her...

Ah, I went on a tangent.

![break]

Let's hear the elder's greeting.

"We are honored to have you receive us. Today we've come for congratulations. Moreover, allow us to show our gratitude---" the elder said with a salute.

Normally speaking, they would first greet me, then announce their allegiance to me. As for the people who had joined the Federation from the start, some of them would express appreciation due to my efforts in ensuring their safety and comfort in life. But this was the first time the elven elder and I had met each other. I felt somewhat estranged after hearing his thanks, so I asked Rigurd to inquire about it.

"Oh, that's because---"

The elder claimed that it was related to the gozu and mezu tribes. The two races had been fighting each other for over a hundred years, and it was said that the biggest victim of it were the elves.

The elder stated---

The elves relied on the resources of the forest to survive, to them the expansion of the warzone was an issue that concerned their livelihood. In order to prevent themselves from being harmed by external threats, the elves applied a disorienting 'Barrier' around their hidden residence. However, the war had damaged the forest---as the trees were chopped down the 'Barrier' was destroyed.

Without vegetation, trying to disorientate invaders was futile, which left their hidden residence completely exposed to the outside world. They managed to quickly relocate the tribe and were able to avoid the harm, but they didn't expect the scale of war to gradually increase.

The war caused the animals and monsters of the forest to flee. Edible vegetables and fruits couldn't be grown, and there were elves that ran off to seek jobs in the Dwarven Kingdom. Now that I thought about it, the elven ladies at Night Butterfly must have left their home for that reason to make a living working in foreign lands.

Later, due to the increased severity of the outflowing population, their residence became hard to maintain. They were forced to plan to move again, but given how large Jura Great Forest was, it was not easy to find a new location of residence.

"That's why, we were hoping to report the matter to you so you may come up with a way to deal with those thugs. But before we could have made the request, your Majesty managed to make the judgement. Now all we need to do is to find a new place to move to---"

By then the people who had gone abroad for work would probably gradually return as well. These were the elder's claims. Upon hearing his words, an idea popped up in my head---a new place to move to...that's right, a place to move to indeed... We have that right here in our town!

The elven population was said to be no more than three hundred people. There were more of their race in ancient times, and back then they apparently also built a kingdom that prospered for a while. But their past glory was no more, the elves had become nomads that scattered all over the world. If they only had three hundred people, we did have a pretty good spot for them to move to.

Indeed, it was the mini forest we just finished building on level 95 of our dungeon. We just had to make them move there. As for their job assignment, we could make them assist Apito in raising bees and growing rare plants which could only be collected from forests with high magicule concentration. Or we could have them assist management in the planned inns on level 95. We could also invite them to manage the weapon shops. Moreover, though I didn't think such a thing would happen, but if there were ever monsters on level 95, it would be more reassuring with elves to protect the village. I heard that they got along really well with the treants, so Treyni-san and the others shouldn't object.

There was tons of work over there to do, they could also use this opportunity to call back the scattered tribesmen from around the world. *Perhaps those girls making money abroad will return too. By that time, will the Elf Club for special members only no longer just be a dream---?*

*Amazing, this is amazing.*

There were bars in our town too, except that they served as restaurants as well. Doing it this way was most suitable for the adventurers. When I wanted to enjoy a drink in peace however, that only left me with the executive's restaurant to go to.

*I could always ask Shuna to help me prepare drinks in my own room, but I'm not that desperate for a drink.*

*I just want...just want to catch a breath sometimes. The reason isn't that I can't leave myself open when Shuna's present. Or that I won't be able to chat nonsense with Gobta, or that I can't find a suitable place to have secret meetings with Myourmiles-kun, none of these are the "actual reasons", it goes without saying.*

*---Seriously no, I'm telling the truth!*

If we had a shop like Night Butterfly, I would be able to find venues for all sorts of things. But that's just an idea. Seeing that the elven elder looked rather confused, I decided to raise the idea and give it a go.

"Chief, I've got a suitable place for you to move to---"

Due to me speaking up personally, Rigurd stepped back to be a listener. Perhaps he had found the time to train, no matter what situation he ran into, he was always able to respond without a sweat. Even if I slid off onto another tangent, he would probably help to round things out perfectly. How reliable.

"Oh, OHOH! Is that true, your Majesty?"

"Hmm. Since there are just three hundred of you, we can take in all of your tribesmen."

"Thank you! Then please wait for me to return and bring all the tribesmen together to meet you."

"Got it. Before you return, I will also modify the living environment to accommodate your residence. But I have some work that I want you to handle, is that all right?"

"There's certainly no problem. If us elves can contribute for Rimuru your Majesty, it will be our greatest fortune."

The elven elder was happier than I expected. He must have gotten a huge burden off his chest now that they didn't need to worry about roaming in the dangerous forest in search for a place of residence. He immediately sent men back to have the tribesmen prepare for the move.

That's how we decided to allow the elves to move into the labyrinth. It would be fine if things just concluded like this, but the elder brought up something that concerned me. He mentioned that many people who had gone out to earn money recently had not returned. He also added that the elven race was very united and that he didn't think these people would abandon their hometown like this...

There were even cases of people not returning after going out to hunt monsters, which concerned him greatly.

But it might just have been due to elves' keen inclination towards the idea of individualism, so perhaps they suddenly had the urge to leave, as the elder put it---this suddenly reminded me of something, it's what I overheard at Myourmiles's shop. Viscount Kazak of the kingdom of Blumund once went to discuss business with Myourmiles. I recalled that he mentioned opening a store that would use elven slaves...

Some of the elven youths had not returned for long. Their disappearance seemed to be linked to Viscount Kazak who got hold of elven slaves---actually, linked to some criminal organization. If this ominous prediction of mine was true...

Hopefully, I was just worrying too much, or else the problem would be severe.

I went so far as to push forward my dream of opening an Elf Club, but it seemed to be necessary to thoroughly investigate this situation first.

I bid the elven elder farewell who thanked me and was about to leave as I contemplated in heart. Then through 'Thought Communication', I commanded Souei who was awaiting orders behind me.

<Souei, go investigate Viscount Kazak of the Kingdom of Blumund.>

<Understood!>

Souei immediately dispatched his 'Clones' to handle the investigation.

![break]

That should do it. Hopefully before the end of the reception ceremony, I could more or less get hold of some information. I could then find Myourmiles and ask him about how much information he had on the criminal organization that traded slaves. If we found out in the end that they were related to this, we would not spare them without payback. It was a challenge to my love for elves after all.

My personal ambition was to open the Elf Club^[The nature of this facility is more like "Elven Cabaret Club", which is why I'm referring it as "Elf Club", in the original text they are simply referred to as "Elf Shop".] of my dreams and be the owner of the place. I'd just have to defeat whoever dared to get in the way of my business. I made up my mind and decided to open an investigation on the matter.

![soft scene break]

The last day of the lengthy reception ceremony finally arrived. If I made it through today, the nation-founding festival would then be hosted in three days.

![break]

After the meeting with the elves, there weren't many other issues. Everything went smoothly and the monsters that temporarily settled in the town had not caused any major disputes either. The incident caused by Dagruel's sons had become public knowledge at this point, but these idiots who tried to show off their power had also been tamed. Although I didn't want to praise Shion, sometimes her lofty, violent behavior could be of use too.

Geld who had been on vacation since a few days ago had returned to the nation. Diablo and Hakurou had also returned yesterday.

"Oh oh, Rimuru-sama. I see that you are as majestic as always. It's been so long since I got to meet you, the joy in my heart is overflowing," Diablo started to say this nonsense followed by a series of "Kufufufufu" laughter. What prestige does a slime have?? this guy's eyes must have some problem---is what I honestly thought.

I really wanted to hear his report, however, we would have to discuss that later. Diablo looked disappointed, but today we had an important meeting. The guests we were having a meeting with today were VIPs, drawing much attention from me.

I definitely couldn't get careless. It was imaginable that this would be the toughest reception yet. That's why today I had all of the executives present to participate in the ceremony.

As for these VIPs, I had Benimaru working on welcoming them. The fact that my right-hand man Benimaru took the task---from that alone you should realize how important this tribe was.

A heated aura like burning fire gradually approached outside the entrance. It seemed that the rumor was true. As the door opened, a group of armed militias entered. They were---the race that Benimaru visited in person as an envoy.

![break]

The tengu race.

![break]

They resided on the Coscia mountain at the border of Jura Great Forest, an independent faction outside of my territory. Technically speaking, this was no reception, it was more like a conference. The armed militia arrived at the reception hall. Their leader was a beautiful young girl.

I thought that they were called tengu because they had long noses^[The kanji Fuse used for tengu is "長鼻族" which means "The race with long nose" and is why Rimuru thinks they have long nose. Their name can also be written as "天狗族" which means heavenly dog. (Which is honestly the correct use of the word as you read on)]. The tengu race was the heavenly dog (tengu), in simpler terms, they were the mixed race between angels and mountain wolves (Okami)---

![break]

<<Notice. The correct term is not mixed race. The angel race incarnated into the bodies of mountain wolf race to have formed this race.>>

![break]

Oh yeah, they seemed to be a race originated from incarnation.

The mountain wolves were a type of beastmen, they were born to be lonesome and prideful. Their name Okami (Mountain Wolf) has the same pronunciation as "Great God". And so the name "tengu" had become a metaphor for "Person with extraordinary sense of smell". By the way, about this race that seemed to be worshipped as mountain deities---

![break]

<<Notice. Correctly speaking it is not the race that is worshipped. It is like individual "Ranga" who due to his "Individual" ability caused him to be categorized into the subgroup of deity.>>

![break]

---Right right.

![break]

I was actually completely out of the loop on the whole thing, but basically these were mountain wolves who were born as deities that were crazy strong. Due to the incarnation of angels using their flesh, they were able to give birth to the tengu race that retained their personal will.

That powerful individual was the biological parent of this young girl in front of me, the elder of the tengu race. This elder's power had declined greatly due to the birth of said child. It was for this reason that this young girl had become the chief of the tengu tribe.

Since we shouldn't call this a reception, it was more appropriate to call it a conference. Moreover, there's something more important---

.........

......

...

Benimaru paid this tengu tribe a visit before.

![break]

They were kind enough to have allowed the high orcs to move over to their region, but in reality, this race was extremely prideful. If we were to demand of them to fall under my control, they would definitely dislike us. It may inevitably lead to war. Of course, I never planned on doing that in the first place.

This powerful race was strong enough to be worshipped as mountain deities, so there was no reason to deliberately fight them. Benimaru was well aware of that too. The goal of this visit was to obtain their permission to build the road from our kingdom to Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion.

"I've successfully established contact with them. The tengu tribe cannot ignore Rimuru-sama, they apparently wish to pay you a visit," Benimaru reported to me after returning, yet in contrast to his report, he looked very exhausted.

"Was there any problem?"

"No, that's not the case..."

I asked him worryingly, to which Benimaru bit his tongue and didn't give a direct response. There was also Alvis who went along with him as an envoy, after returning, her body---actually, her mood---was very bad. The atmosphere then didn't seem to be appropriate to ask questions. I couldn't do anything about them, but I decided to force Benimaru to answer my question. It was quite inconvenient to make him talk in front of the rest of the executives, so I went for a drink with Benimaru in private.

These were the things I managed to get out of him---

![hard scene break]

Benimaru and Alvis brought a dozen Kurenai members and arrived at the hidden village of the tengu tribe.

![break]

Their journey had been smooth, up until they were halted by some young warriors of the tengu tribe in front of a cave on the top of Mount Coscia. The young warriors were wearing all white with a tachi sheathed on their belts. They had a pair of white wings sprouting from their backs and adorning their heads were triangle-shaped ears, like you'd find on dogs. They even had a tail! Observing their well-trained stances, it became readily apparent that they were proficient in martial arts. Benimaru wasn't oblivious to this fact and informed them about their intentions, seeking permission to be let through the 'Barrier' deployed in the cave.

The young warriors approved their requests and led Benimaru and Alvis inside. Through the cave, they were greeted with flowers blossoming in what can only be described as an arcadia^[This phrase here in source is "桃源郷", which is a term referring to an ideal/perfect location that people reside whether with materialistic abundance or other desirable traits of an ideal society. The closest term in I can find in English for this is "Arcadia" (Greek concept) or "Eden" (Biblical concept), both refers to a form of "heaven on earth" or utopian ideal society.]. It was neither too cold nor too hot, the weather was always perfectly comforting---as expected from the residence of a powerful race, this was a beautiful village.

The warriors led him to a location where a beautiful girl came out to welcome Benimaru.

This girl, unlike the other tengu tribesmen, looked fairly similar to humans. Her pure white hair reached her shoulder, with the hair near the sides of her ears turning bright red. Her small, cherry-colored lips looked very soft. With pupils that resembled that of a wolf's, her narrow pair of eyes gazed at Benimaru inquisitively, without turning, as if she were analyzing her prey.

*This person is not to be underestimated*---Benimaru thought to himself. Her presence could rival Demon Lord Karion, who he had met before, or maybe she was even beyond that.

"My name is Benimaru. I am visiting as a representative of Demon Lord Rimuru-sama."

"Welcome, Envoy-dono. I am the daughter of the tengu tribe elder. Momiji^[紅葉 Autumn leaf] is my name. So, what is the purpose of your visit? Do you plan to take over this land?"

Despite the glamorous smile on her face, the response she gave to Benimaru's greeting was anything but friendly.

*We are not welcomed here*, Benimaru could sense that. But he was not going to let such a minor thing hold him back.

"We have no such intent. We only wish that you will grant us the permission to pass by and cross the Coscia mountain between here and the border of Jura Great Forest. If possible, I also hope that you will permit us to dig a tunnel in this mountain."

"Hmph. So you claim that you have no ambition to expand, I see... You may have permission to pass...but what do you mean by digging a tunnel?"

Momiji was not interested in hearing Benimaru's explanation, but the word "tunnel" had caught her attention. Honestly speaking, Benimaru was not too sure about what this "tunnel" thing was either, the rough explanation Rimuru gave him was that it is about opening a hole in the mountain. In fact, this tunnel plan hadn't even been tested yet, ever since Rimuru proposed it. If they were connecting with the capital of Sarion, digging a tunnel would create the shortest route. Technically there was no need to go that far; connecting the road to one of Sarion's towns along the border would suffice. There was really no need to dig a tunnel. Benimaru was aware of that plan B, but he still decided to bring it up.

"This tunnel thing, it is something about opening a hole in the mountain so that the road can extend to the opposite side. We won't press it if it's not convenient for you---"

"Hold on. Opening a hole in the mountain? Are you serious?"

"Indeed. That's how the plan states it. But we don't need to dig any tunnel for the road being constructed this time. I only asked beforehand in case of it becoming a necessity in the future. If you are not willing, we will not force you to do so," Benimaru answered swiftly. However, the tengu tribesmen began to sway. To them, the mountain was holy, things like digging tunnels was tantamount to blasphemy.

"You are truly awful. We don't care for whether a slime becomes a demon lord or not, he can do what he wants as long as he does not interfere with us. We even planned to close one eye for you and that stinking snake you brought^[The source is: Snake that stinks of wild beast]. But we can't just sit here and endure now that you dared to belittle our divine mountain."

Upon saying so, Momiji rose from her seat. Benimaru didn't mean that at all, but given the circumstances right now, continuing negotiations with them seemed impossible.

*What a misstep*---Benimaru thought to himself.

Even if Benimaru tried to talk them out of it, the other party wouldn't back down. He decided his best course of action would be to remain still for a while longer, an opinion Alvis clearly didn't share as she broke her silence with words of indignation.

"You mentioned a snake that stinks, were you perhaps referring to me?"

She was secretly boiling in fury as she stood up from her seat to stare at Momiji. A fight was about to break out as both persons began to emit a dangerous aura.

"Oi, stop that at once---"

Benimaru tried to halt her when Alvis's sharp gaze was shot at Momiji.

Extra Skill 'Eyes of Heavenly Snake'---effects of paralysis, poison and madness etc. began to corrupt Momji who was in Alvis's direct line of sight.

Yet Momiji wasn't concerned at all.

"Petty trickeries," she chided. "I am the daughter of the tengu tribe elder; status ailment doesn't work on me." She closed her hands to draw out a fan.

The tengu were semi-spiritual lifeforms. Just as Momiji said, they had high resistance against status ailment. Moreover, Momiji's Extra Skill 'Sense of Heavenly Wolf' was always activated. It offered analysis ability that surpassed the five senses and had effects similar to an advanced version of Extra Skill 'Magic Perception'. But that was not all, 'Sense of Heavenly Wolf' could also nullify all illusion and conjuring magic. That's why such a sneak attack on Momiji would never work.

It's almost as if she were saying "*It's my turn"*, Momiji raised her fan and with smooth dancing motions, launched an attack at Alvis. Alvis blocked the first hit with her golden khakkhara, yet was hit on the side of her stomach by the immediate follow-up, sending her flying to the corner of the hall.

![break]

"Oooof."

![break]

Although it was just a casual strike, Momiji's movement was extremely skillful. She reopened the fan that closed due to the previous hit and elegantly used it to conceal her mouth.

![break]

A moment passed before Momiji broke the silence.

![break]

"Is that all? I see the prestigious Beastketeer isn't that strong after all."

![exact fit image](image10)

Now that hurt Alvis's dignity.

"Don't underestimate me now, you hick. I held back since we are negotiating with you, but it seems there's no such need anymore."

Alvis's wounds had all been healed as she stood up uncaringly. She glared back at Momiji with cold eyes. As a high-ranked majin of the Beast Kingdom Eurazania, she began to demonstrate the proper style to stand off against Momiji.

"Holding back? That's my line. I've put an effort trying not to kill our envoy. Or is it that you intend to truly anger me?"

The two stared at each other as the temperature in the surrounding room began to drop noticeably. Even the young tengu warriors standing guard in the hall fell victim as the whole room was filled with concentrated youki that tensed their nerves. Under such circumstances, only Benimaru was drinking tea on his seat.

*This could no longer be simply described as a misstep; things have gotten problematic.* He thought to himself while taking a sip.

"You are indeed strong. But this world is not so pretty as to allow some little girl with no combat experience to triumph."

"Wanna try? As you've said, I want to accumulate combat experience too. You happen to be a pretty good target to experiment with."

The animosity was ever increasing between the two until it reached the breaking point.

![break]

At that instant---

With the flash of a sword, the fan in Momiji's hand was deflected.

Silence fell upon the hall.

The speed was so fast that no one was able to respond when Benimaru intervened in the duel.

"That's it. It was my fault to have spoken things that displeased you. With that being said, I will not allow you to kill my companion," Benimaru declared calmly.

"B-Benimaru-sama? Are you implying that I would lose?"

"Yes. Had I not intervened in time, you would have been cut in half."

"T-That's a lie! I did control my attack power---"

"No, your control of youki is not skillful enough. There was too much strength."

"H-How could this---"

"I... I lost...?"

Momiji and Alvis both unconsciously collapsed at the same time at the scene. It was then that a door deep into the hall was opened as a beauty with large dog ears appeared.

The young tengu warriors quickly kneeled.

"M-Mother!"

As she cracked a smile towards the panicked Momiji, the tengu elder---Momiji's mother---slowly stepped forward.

She then stepped towards Momiji---

"Silly girl!"

The elder scolded her loudly while approaching. Everyone changed the venue and the two parties sat face to face again. It was a Japanese-style room with tatami and futon (Japanese bedding). Deeper into this room was another U-shaped room without a door. It was specially arranged so that the tengu elder, who was often bedridden, could take a rest as soon as possible when she needed it.

After the incident, the elder gave Momiji a lesson with her fists, she was still holding her head with tears in her eyes. Although she still looked quite indignant, she didn't appear to complain anymore.

"It's all right, you don't have to force yourself. We've only come here to greet you---"

Although their goal was not reached, the atmosphere at hand was no longer suitable for any negotiation. Moreover, Alvis was also dejected, so staying any longer would only make the situation more awkward. Benimaru decided to leave when the elder herself came forth to abruptly halt him.

"Hehehe, don't mind that, young man. Speaking of which, your swordsmanship was extraordinary. Could it be 'Oboro-Ryu' (School of Haziness)^[This swordsmanship style has been mentioned before as well, I will be referring it to as Oboro-Ryu as there is no good alternative. "朧" (Oboro) means hazy and unclear (There are also skills with this word in it), "流" (Ryu) means school/style.]?"

"Why do you---actually, I see how it is now. Momiji-dono's fan dance also had elements of my style. Could it be---"

"Indeed. I've also studied 'Oboro-Ryu', from my mentor---'Byakuya Araki'."

"What!"

Benimaru was shocked. Seeing his expression, the tengu elder smiled contently.

"My name is Kaede (Maple)---"

After saying this, the tengu elder Kaede began to tell the story of her past. According to her, around three hundred years ago, she seemed to have stayed in the ogre's village. She hid her true strength, went on journeys, and happened to encounter Byakuya and studied sword art under him. Kaede had a senior back then; the man could only be described as a genius who was born for the arts of the sword. He was also Byakuya's grandson.

"How upsetting that I couldn't grant him a name."

Apparently, this was Byakuya's mantra. Naming monsters on a whim may end up costing you your life. Byakuya was human, so he would have definitely died. At the time, Kaede also didn't have a 'Name', so she couldn't understand how he felt back then, unlike now. The hope he held was to leave something for his loved one. To monsters, it was normal to not have names, but it was different for humans.

Later, Byakuya's life came to an end and passed away from this world leaving his grandson, who then became the Demon Swordsman (Kenki)^[Kenki is a title that this person got, it is directly translated to "Sword Devil".]. His strength quickly approached that of Kaede, and his technique was already far beyond hers. Moreover, Kaede was mesmerized by his dashing swordsmanship.

And so she confessed her love to him under a large maple tree. After sharing a night together, she departed from the ogre village...

The climate in the Jura Great Forest was very unstable, that maple tree, however, had always stood tall and beautiful. Its autumn leaves would be dyed with a pretty red color. It had become a symbol of the village which even Benimaru remembered. He recognized that she was speaking the truth.

"Eh, hold on, wouldn't that make you Hakurou's..."

Benimaru became anxious and his mutter slipped out of his mouth unconsciously.

"Oh, so is he called Hakurou now?" Kaede replied. "I see, my senior Kenki-dono got a name. To be honest however... It's quite surprising to learn that he's even still alive."

Benimaru was getting more and more nervous seeing Kaede finishing her words with a smile on her face.

*H-Hold up, hold up. Does Hakurou know about this?*

All sorts of questions like that crossed his mind. But what happened next made Benimaru even more bewildered.

"With that being said, I can finally be reassured now."

"...?"

"Hakurou-dono has trained a reliable and courageous prodigy, and he will be the husband to my daughter."

*Pffft!*

Benimaru was trying to drink some tea to calm down, but he had accidentally spit it out now. Benimaru seldom lost his cool, yet this whole trip had been full of surprises ever since they arrived at the village. Benimaru, however, was not the only one to lose composure. Alvis next to him became speechless, dropping her teacup, which shattered into a million pieces.

Upon hearing this, Momiji looked at Benimaru first with her face blushed before turning to her mother Kaede.

"W-wait a second, mother---?"

She helplessly tried to cover up Kaede's mouth, but Momiji was no rival to Kaede. She suppressed Momiji single-handedly and turned to Benimaru with a serious tone, "Then, Benimaru-dono. The proposal you just raised; we will accept all of its content. Moreover, we can pledge allegiance to Demon Lord Rimuru. However, the condition is that you will marry my daughter. That point really goes without saying, but I suppose I should ask for your perspective."

*How do you expect me to respond after asking so directly about such an important matter*---Benimaru was at a loss.

Hopefully, they would give him some time to consider. The other person who managed to save Benimaru was the girl of the hour, Momiji.

"Hold on! I know that mother has already acknowledged this guy. But I haven't! He does indeed seem stronger than me... If that's the case, I hope that he would not be forced by Mother, but rather to truly like me. A good woman should move the heart of the man she likes, didn't mother always say that?"

Momiji flustered for some reason after saying this. She used her fan to hide her face before running away on her own. Kaede laughed out loud at the scene. Alvis raised her head with some form of revelation while Benimaru felt a bit embarrassed seeing how Momiji had acted.

*Speaking of this, Hakurou has always acted very gracefully... Now that I've lost my cool over such an insignificant matter, it only means that my training is still lacking---*

He did some self-reflection---but this whole incident just happened too abruptly... And so his marriage with Momiji was brought back to be discussed.

![break]

Basically, the whole deal had been Kaede's own personal wish, not actually something she wanted to impose on Benimaru. At most she was just delivering a message. It would be a huge gain for her if Benimaru had agreed, but that's just a thought. The rest of the requests from the Tempest Federation were also passed after brief discussion, there wasn't much of a problem. The tunnel digging on the mountain was discussed separately, they permitted us to build the road to Sarion.

However, there were other issues to be discussed. Putting aside whether Benimaru and Momiji could get together, they hoped that the tengu tribe could build a good relationship with Demon Lord Rimuru---Kaede proposed as much.

Despite how she looked, Kaede was in fact extremely ill---or so they proclaimed to the public.

It was however not the case. Kaede was pregnant with Momiji for too long and passed most of her power to Momiji. After giving birth to her fifteen years ago^[She met Hakurou around 300 years ago... That was a loooong pregnancy.] and giving her a 'Name'. This caused her, the worshipped earth deity, to consume almost all of her magicule storage. Now she could only await her end.

That's why Kaede hoped to find her cute yet inexperienced daughter a strong backing. That was her only wish.

And Benimaru happened to visit that land. To Kaede, it was a sign of hope. Kaede thought it was the last string of hope left by the man she loved.

*It won't matter even if my wish is rejected. So Demon Lord Rimuru had you by his side? I thought that you would have passed before me, what a delightful miscalculation. Surely it will draw back your memory when you see that child Momiji---*Kaede thought to herself, and so she agreed to discuss the issue in the future.

![break]

And so, it was Momiji's turn to visit Demon Lord Rimuru.

![hard scene break]

About that... Benimaru seemed to be getting a serious headache over the whole thing. It was probably the biggest crisis Benimaru had ever faced since he was born. He claimed it was even scarier than our initial encounter, which I was really not sure how to interpret. Perhaps it was Benimaru's way of joking.

Putting that aside however, even that Alvis was easily suppressed. That woman's combat ability was not to be underestimated. It was fortunate that we didn't antagonize her.

---No, I'm running away from reality, that's not the issue. I never expected Hakurou to have a daughter...

A huge problem had emerged, and what truly unnerved me was that the conclusion I reached in resolving it was that we wouldn't know how to deal with the matter unless we met them. After all, this issue couldn't be resolved by me and Benimaru alone. Hakurou would also play a key role in this, I'd have to hear him out. But at the time it was not convenient to summon him back... That's why, before Hakurou's return, we decided to push these questions back for now.

![break]

And soon after, last night---we found Hakurou who had returned from the Kingdom of Farmus to discuss among the three of us. Right now we had no clue what type of demands the tengu tribe would make. There was no telling what might happen, so we planned to receive them on the last day. That's why I was about to summon Hakurou back if he didn't manage to get back in time. But it seemed there was no such need.

With that being said however, he did manage to return in time, but the problem remained unresolved. Whether Benimaru would be marrying Momiji or not, it would be their problem. Even if they were getting married it was fine. Basically it's none of my business...

![break]

"Please hold on! I have my own considerations as well, or perhaps should I stand my ground---"

"What are you talking about? Could it be that young master thinks my daughter is not worthy of you?"

"I never said that! By the way, you've never even seen her, didn't even know she was born, so don't act like a father now!"

"It is because I know that fact that I'm gonna take responsibility from now on!"

And just like that, Benimaru didn't know what to do while Hakurou was acting abnormally... Things had gotten a lot more complex. There was no way this meeting could continue...

![break]

We continued discussing without any rest, but there was still no conclusion. Afterwards we just decided on directly confronting the issue, which is how things had progressed up until today.

.........

......

...

A table had been temporarily set up in the reception hall. A beautiful young girl was sitting across from me. The color of her hair transitioned from beautiful white to vibrant red. This young girl was the tengu tribe's representative, the fabled Momiji.

She was looking at me arrogantly and greeted me in a bold tone.

"Demon Lord Rimuru, nice to meet you. I have come in place of the chief of tengu tribe. My name is Momiji, I look forward to our future interaction."

"You are too kind. I am Rimuru who just became a demon lord. What you see now is my human form, but I'm actually a slime. I'm practically a pacifist, so you can discuss with me if you ever run into any trouble."

"You may spare the concern. It is truly impressive that you've united Jura Great Forest in this short time. I acknowledge that you are the ruler of this forest, so I hope you will be a good neighbor. However, do not interfere with us," Momiji declared in front of the many executives of mine. Shion was about to react as her body shook a bit. But surprisingly she endured it. I didn't tell her about the whole story, so it must have been Shion herself who decided to hold back. It seemed that there had been some change in her mind, causing her to no longer pursue every minor matter. That's a good sign, but it was also a bit eerie. I hoped she wouldn't endure too much and have an outbreak someday.

And about this Momiji, she was looking quite nervous while waiting for my response. It would not have been noticed if I hadn't pointed it out. While she looked quite casual and relaxed, internally she was probably on the verge of being crushed by extreme unease. That's probably because she couldn't tell whether I was friend or foe.

*If that's the case, all you guys need to do is show your willingness for allegiance. But how could such a thing be allowed by their prideful race? After all, an inexperienced leader is done for if she's looked down on by others. I can understand her sentiment. But speaking of this, the young warriors of the tengu tribe do all seem to have given their fullest loyalty to Momiji.*

"I see. I understand what you are getting at. We don't intend to interfere too much. I believe Benimaru here has also explained, we just want to conduct some road construction work at the foot of Coscia mountain. There's also another thing that I want to confirm with you, will you give the high orcs the permission to stay now that they've moved their settlement to the lower mountain region?"

"All right, all of these are fine. We've never claimed ownership to the resources of the mountain and forests, so they can do what they wish with the minerals. Those things are beyond our ownership. We simply dislike being interfered with, that is all."

About that... The lower mountain region was part of the Jura Great Forest, so I expected that she would complain about it. While bracing myself for their answer, it seemed that they didn't have a problem with it either.

If that's the case, what could the tengu tribe really be on guard about? It seemed that Alvis also disliked them a lot, could it be some conflict with Beast King Karion? I was rather mindful of it, so I decided to cut to the chase.

"About that, I'm not sure what you guys are wary of, but we really don't hope to be hostile against you."

"Why should I believe you?"

"Hmm, even if you were to claim that we had ambitions to expand our territory, do you really have any evidence to warrant your suspicion?"

Momiji turned to me immediately upon hearing this, trying to determine whether we were friendly or hostile. Then she replied boldly: "Aren't you guys on good terms with that sly bird lady Frey? Her desire to usurp our land is the best evidence!"

The so-called unforeseeable surprise^[The source here states: 寝耳に水, which means unforeseeable event] perfectly represented this type of situation.

![break]

"Hold on, time out!"

![break]

"Time out what now? What does that mean?"

"It means stop! We need to discuss some things!"

I gathered all the executives and began to discuss. Momiji agreed without hesitation, but it seemed to have been mixed with some complaints... I must have heard wrong. While leaving aside Momiji who was muttering something, we gathered in a circle.

"Right, what do you guys think?"

"Ex-Demon Lord Frey's territory is connected with the Coscia mountain, so it wouldn't be unheard of if she has caused conflict with the tengu tribe," to my question, Souei quickly replied.

Indeed, I checked the map in my mind as I thought so. The tengu's residence was not within the Jura Great Forest and therefore not within any demon lord's agreement of protection. They were very easily invaded by others.

"But what could have been the reason?"

"Indeed, there's no reason to invade," Benimaru followed up. He had gone to the actual location and knew that there weren't any resources there.

"I've heard something before. It is rumored that Frey likes to go to move around locations with high altitude. Perhaps it is just as her nickname 'Sky Queen' suggests, could she be trying to move her city to the highest location?" Hakurou pondered while raising the case, but it still sounded a bit weird. Since according to Benimaru, only by going through the cave at the mountain top would you reach the arcadia that was the hidden residence of the tengu tribe---in other words, it was actually in a tiny alternate dimension. I figured that would be quite different from the city that Frey would hope for.

"Hmmm---"

Everyone fell silent while contemplating. And then---

"You people---Stop treating me like air!"

"Uhh!"

I got spooked when someone suddenly shouted next to me. Momiji had come over to vent her rising frustration. Now I couldn't pretend that I'd not heard her. So I decided to give up struggling and returned to my seat. I opened up directly facing Momiji, "I have a question to ask. Has Frey ever schemed against the tengu domain for the purpose of expanding?"

"Ah? What nonsense is that---"

Momiji looked at me dumbfounded. But after realizing that I was serious, she muttered: "You gotta be joking..." I saw that we seemed to be developing a grave misunderstanding, so to alleviate that, I asked her to give a detailed explanation of her own situation. Here's what Momiji had to say:

The place Frey had her eyes on was the capital of Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion, "City embraced by the divine tree, Elmin Sarion". She was not pursuing territory, but height. *Can't believe that's actually her goal*. It was quite like Frey's style, and she wasn't joking around.

Judging by scale alone, Sarion was undoubtedly a powerful nation with military power exceeding that of Frey. However, though the Sarion army could utilize its geographic advantage to look down on land armies from above, they couldn't avoid the harsh battle against the great army of Frey who could fly freely in the sky. In other words, Frey had not given up on the divine tree. It was then that Frey took interest in the tengu tribe. She wanted to recruit the powerful tengu race to bolster her arsenal against Sarion.

However, the tengu were a prideful race. They wouldn't listen to Frey's command that easily. On the other hand, Sarion had also predicted how the tengu would act. They simply observed the other two factions battling each other until they depleted their strength. Sarion didn't intend to collaborate in fighting their enemy but sat and enjoyed the profit of their conflict. Of course, Frey also realized this and didn't make a move without caution. And so, a twisted triangle relationship was thus formed...

It was then that the war between me and Clayman broke out, and soon enough Karion and Frey became Demon Lord Milim's subjects. A powerful force was thus born. One that the tengu tribe was unable to defend against. Every day since then they had been discussing where to migrate to in the future.

Benimaru and the others happened to visit at the time. The unlucky part was that the Beastketeer Alvis was with them. It has caused Momiji to have misunderstood that we were quietly pressuring them.

"What's the situation on Frey-san's side?" I asked Geld. He was in charge of the construction of their new capital, so Frey probably had made many requests from him. Among my allies, he was the man most familiar with Frey.

"Yes Sir, about this Frey-sama, she's very satisfied with Rimuru-sama's design. She's even able to communicate smoothly with Mildo-san who doesn't like to talk, even holding detailed discussions in the past."

*Oh, so she can even communicate with Mildo. I'm rather impressed by Frey.*

"I see. Then she probably won't be interested in the divine tree."

"Indeed... Actually, speaking of that, Frey-sama's interest has turned to---I've spoken too much---"

"Hmm? What happened to Frey's interest?"

"Yes Sir, actually... We've not seen Milim-sama for a while. Frey-sama who was responsible for educating her didn't pay attention for a second and she ran off to god knows where---"

Ah, right. I know where she is. But, I'm gonna pretend I know nothing of it. The saying goes "Don't go look for trouble yourself", I didn't want to get dragged in that mess.

"---So that's how it is, Frey-sama's new hobby...or rather, focus, I think has been her search for Demon Lord Milim-sama," Geld concluded his explanation.

The skyscrapers of the new capital---that gigantic building that reaches for the sky had completely mesmerized Frey. Surely at this point, comparing it to any other city would just be stupid, so she must have lost interest in them as well. Compared to that, Milim was the bigger problem.

After which, Momiji absorbed the entirety of our conversation. The dichotomy between her imagination and the reality was so large to have caused her to become speechless, not knowing how to react. I guess that should be the case. That's just how the reality really is. They were just keeping up their guard against a certain enemy that might cause crisis to their race, but it turned out she had switched her focus long ago. Learning this today would definitely prompt people to try and escape reality.

"---I understand the whole thing now. Anyway, that's how it is. It is enough for me to have been able to resolve your misunderstanding."

It was likely because the tengu had kept away from the world and were less informed on current affairs. They were still worried about being surrounded by enemies. Such anxiety caused Momiji to misjudge. Indeed, she had her reasons to make such judgement under those circumstances.

"I can't believe that it was me who thought too much... Mother has always said that I was worrying too much about the matter..."

After finishing her words, Momiji felt relieved. She collapsed on the spot having been so exhausted. Seeing how she reacted, we gained a very profound insight into how terrifying it was to cause too much misunderstanding.

![soft scene break]

Since the misunderstanding had been resolved, the meeting quickly concluded. In place of the frustrated Momiji, a young warrior of the tengu tribe confirmed the content of our pact. I thought that he was just Momiji's guard, but it seemed that he was also a capable civil official.

The tunnel part was reserved for now. Their argument was that if we couldn't prove that the construction would be absolutely safe, they wouldn't allow us to work. I found it reasonable and easily agreed, so there weren't any problems with that. We still needed to talk with the executives from Sarion regarding us building a tunnel, but we would plan for that after the train development had concluded. There was no immediate need to make a decision at this point in time. The tengu tribe hoped that we would not interfere with them, but they only said so fearing that we might rally and invade them.

Now that our misunderstanding had been resolved, there was no reason why we shouldn't communicate. And so we reached common ground, at last where we would help each other out no matter what problem we ran into.

![break]

"---Then, is that everything?"

"Yes. We are extremely grateful for your understanding and participation in this helpful meeting with us. Thank you, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama," the young warrior of the tengu tribe bowed to me courteously. Momiji was no longer misunderstanding us and we had also signed a pact. The only thing left was---

The relationship between Hakurou and Momiji as well as the marriage between Benimaru and her.

We had discussed a ton last night to no avail. From what happened today, Momiji seemed to have suspected we were enemies throughout the session, but those misunderstandings had now been resolved. Now then, shouldn't we let the people involved sort things out by themselves?

![break]

Just as I was worried about how to approach the subject, the young tengu warrior took out a sealed envelope.

"There's one more thing. Please have a look at this. It contains a letter written by our leader Kaede-sama to your Majesty Rimuru," as he finished, he handed over the letter to me gently. Rigurd took the letter and handed it to Shuna for her to open. She began to read the content of the letter out loud.

The letter opened with some abstruse words of greeting followed by some humble writing that seemed to be trying to get on the recipient's good side. But then the word choices became more and more casual. As Shuna read it, a sense of confusion arose on her face too.

"*---Even though she's a headache to deal with and misunderstood you, I'll entrust my daughter to you. That child even bragged about letting Benimaru-dono fall in love with her before, she really doesn't mean any harm---*"

![break]

*Eh, are you sure this is a letter for me? No no, no no no, it doesn't seem to be no matter how you see it. Had I known that this is the content of the letter from the start, I would have the honor guard leave the scene... But it's all too late at this point.*

![break]

"M-Mother, what is this---?"

Momiji who was on the ground suddenly jumped up to take the letter from Shuna's hand. *Eh, that's so rude. But I can't really blame her---*

Since I couldn't blame her, I'd just pretend I saw nothing. If I switched places with Momiji right now, god knows what type of thing I would have done. This had long since passed a matter concerning reputation and was challenging the limits of shame.

"S-So there are actually two letters! That's so rash, mother dear..." Momiji cried out loud and collapsed on the ground, burying her face in her hands.

*Ah, I see... It seems that the letter for Hakurou was mixed with the letter for me. Missy, please stay strong.*

While the tengu tribesmen were coming and trying to comfort Momiji, it had little more than the opposite effect. It was best to stay away from her for now. But it was at that instant---

"Hehe, that does seem like something she would do."

Hakurou walked towards Momiji with a wry smile. He then took over the letter held tightly in her hand and scanned through it.

"I see how it is now. '*---Although that child possesses powerful strength, her techniques are below expectations. I hope that my senior and the father of that child---"Kenki" Hakurou-dono will instruct her by hand and train her well---To my beloved husband, Kaede---*' I can't believe that girl is still in love with me. Hehehe, living a bit longer does have its plus side."

Upon saying so, Hakurou began to laugh joyfully.

"A-are you... My father?"

"Indeed. I am your father, Hakurou."

"D-Dad!"

Tears began to drop from her black eyes that shared a striking resemblance to Hakurou's. Momiji crushed him in a hug. Hakurou and Momiji had given us a moving scene of a father-daughter reunion. Momiji was no longer holding any suspicion against us or Hakurou.

"Momiji, I am quite strict when it comes to training people."

"Got it---"

"That's good. You will overcome the challenges with flying colors and have Young Master fall in love with you!"

"Yes!!"

Hmm, ehehhh!

I nodded quite frequently with a moved heart when hearing their conversation, but without my notice, the conversation started to stray into some strange direction.

What is this called again? "You have to fill the moat before taking the castle?"^[This is a Japanese proverb 外堀を埋める, which means to achieve a certain goal, some steps must first be taken to get rid of the obstacle. In this case, I think it is referring to the fact that Momiji's presence got rid of the calm factor of Hakurou. But honestly it seems pretty out of place, or maybe just my moonrune skill is shit. Probably the latter.] Hakurou was usually very calm, but now with the sudden appearance of a daughter, he abruptly turned into the idiot dad that spoils his kid.

"Oi, Hakurou---"

Benimaru's words couldn't seem to reach him as the two were enjoying their own little universe. It happened at that moment---

Shuna added with a whisper: "Ah, there's also this---" everyone's eyes fell on Shuna. She didn't mind a single bit as she gazed at Benimaru.

"Nii-san, Alvis-sama has left you a message."

With these words said, Shuna looked up to Benimaru directly.

"What is it?" he asked rather unpleasantly.

*Hmm, I understand how you feel. I think he hopes whatever it is to be put on hold for a while.* However, the cruel reality was that Shuna rolled her eyes and announced the message.

Its content was as follows---

"Benimaru-sama, I've made up my mind. I wish to triumph over Momiji-sama and become your wife, and even if I am not so lucky, I still have the option of concubine. I will not give up, please make your resolve."

---Shuna announced it while imitating Alvis's tone. The honor guards gasped. The executives were all worked up by it.

![break]

"..."

![break]

Benimaru, on the other hand, had his arms crossed and remained silent throughout. *You should be getting a bad headache right now! Benimaru sure is something.*

---Wait a moment, hold on.

He had actually been petrified and shocked speechless. His prowess in the battlefield was second to none, but his ability wasn't enough to handle this situation---I seemed to have discovered an unexpected weak point of Benimaru.

*Sorry, Benimaru. My experience with love affairs is not enough---It's zero, I swear!---to be of any help.*

"Ah, speaking of this, it's so hard being a popular guy..." I couldn't help but blurt out.

"Rimuru-sama, are you serious? You aren't exactly outside his league..."

*Seriously? I don't even have a gender. Gobta sure is an idiot.*

"Kufufufufu, I have no interest in getting into any relationship. My heart only belongs to Rimuru-sama."

*No, I've heard nothing---I'm not interested either, so you can do whatever you want. I'm definitely not thinking about something else.* I started to catch up on the whispers of the executives.

"As expected from Benimaru-dono, he's so popular. I heard that the subordinate of my sister also really likes Benimaru-san, but they are both having a hard time to win over Alvis-dono and Momiji-dono."

"Are you talking about Touka? Actually, not just Touka, even Saika has a crush on him too."

"That's right, I heard that they don't want to compete with Souka and so they gave up on Souei-san!"

"What nonsense are you on about---"

"No no no, it's all true."

Gabil and Souei were whispering to each other.

However, what Gobta then said was the key.

"Does that mean, Benimaru's gonna have a harem? I'm so jealous!"

After that was pointed out, I suddenly began to see things in the same light.

*What the hell? I'm so envious! I'm starting to get jealous of Benimaru as well. Alvis-san is the beautiful and reliable big-sis type girlfriend while Momiji is the cute and tsundere imouto (lil sis). Not only these two, there are many other girls who also like Benimaru. Gobta had a point, in a sense it is just like he is collecting a harem.*

But, Benimaru himself seemed to be quite troubled over it...

"A harem, that does make me envious."

"Heh, that may not be the case. Despite how Benimaru looks, he's a pure-hearted virgin that doesn't know how to deal with girls. He may look like a chad to everyone else, but internally he must be very troubled."

Gabil looked at him with jealousy while Souei gave his response. *I think he nailed the interpretation.* Even if there were many female pursuers, they were just a cause for concern to Benimaru. Moreover, he would be really mindful of how Shuna saw him. Benimaru seemed to be somewhat of a siscon, surely his mind was shouting "oh shit, oh shit" internally.

It was then that Geld interjected and added on: "I think this is a wonderful matter. Benimaru is very manly, so naturally females in this town would admire him. Alvis-dono is naturally strong as the head of the Beastketeers while Momiji-dono is Hakurou-san's daughter, both are impeccable choices. I need to follow in his footsteps."

Geld apparently supported Benimaru in having both a wife and concubine. But whether he would have a harem or not, he hadn't given a comment on the matter. Compared to women, Geld seemed to focus more on work, so I was really skeptical about whether his claim about following Benimaru's footsteps was true or not.

By the way, Geld was actually quite popular too. He was a serious man of few words with an unyielding sense of responsibility. Not only among the female high orcs, many women from the other races also admired him a lot. That's why if Geld ever did take a chance, he would probably end up with a girlfriend pretty fast.

Seeing how Geld reacted, Gabil had something to say too, "No no no, Geld-dono is good enough already. Touka and the rest are just as how I described; they won't even look at me... For some reason, the subordinates who admire me are all men---"

"You must have not met the right person. I can relate to your feeling to some extent."

Geld nodded. Indeed, his workplace was mainly the construction field which had a higher percentage of males. Monsters like me who had no gender and were as hard to differentiate as some amphibian might be exceptions, but if in a working environment there were female coworkers to work alongside the males, they might just be a bit more motivated. That part we would have to discuss later.

"That's not really the case, there are several female dwarven herbalists working with me. If it is true, we would have the chance to see to each other---"

"Then there shouldn't be much of an issue."

Hold up hold up, isn't there still a problem? They were of different races after all. It's not as if the problem was solved if the numbers matched up, right?

"There's quite the big issue actually. Those ladies said that 'I can't seem to physically accept something like a lizard', that's why I'm not popular at all..."

"I see---"

...

*Uh, uhmm. I'm a bit speechless. It seems that his obstacle is bigger than just the race difference. There's no wonder why Gabil can only choose to give up.*

"---Well, it is supposed to only be like that, but Nansou and Hakusou often get invited to meals and picnics in the forest! That really frustrates me---"

Ah! Now we can't use racial difference as an excuse...

"T-That's just..." even Geld ran out of explanations and was troubled by how he could comfort Gabil.

"Yep... That's why I want to try a human form too. My old man got more handsome through 'Transformation', but I may have a chance as well!"

*No way, there's no such chance. It's not just about appearance. I've lived for nearly forty years without a girlfriend, despite looking very handsome!*

The point is---

"How boring. That's all because you never took the initiative yourself."

*Right, Souei-kun, bingo! That's exactly the case. Just ~~being a nice guy~~ being a bystander is not enough. How will any girl fall for Gabil if he only complains like that all the time. Don't fantasize about girls coming after you, instead you should man up and take the initiative... Eh, though I only realized this after becoming a slime...*

"T-there's no such thing, I mean, you're not wrong, but---"

"Souei-san has a point! I've heard the dwarven big sis saying 'Gazart is so cool', 'Right right', 'The quiet type character is the most attractive!', 'He's like my pet lizard, so cute' to praise Gabil-san's subordinate. That's why I don't think the problem is appearance!"

Ah, Gobta was so straight-forward. Gazart was a subordinate of Gabil and a member of Hiryuu. That man was of few words and pretty good with spear arts, but he was also very clumsy. That's why I didn't let him participate in the research program but assigned him as the bodyguard of the researchers and the herbalists. It was obvious that he was originally a lizardman, after his evolution to dragonewt nowadays he looked quite similar to Gabil whose appearance resembled that of a lizard. Now even appearance could no longer be an excuse, Gobta sure was quite mean.

Gabil seemed very frustrated, and Souei dished out the decisive blow.

"---Moreover, it is actually surprisingly easy to get the affection of women."

"W-what do you mean!"

How is that possible---I asked based on this thought, and as a result Souei responded with something extremely unexpected with a cold face.

"There was a female knight who seemed to have had some sort of misunderstanding and developed strong feelings for me," Souei commented almost like a complaint with disdain in his tone.

"Are you serious! What did you do?"

"Oh oh?"

"That sounds so interesting!"

"Please give us the details!"

Souei's words had also caught my interest as I was eavesdropping on the side. About that female knight... Right, what did Souei do to that lady called Ritase? I was curious but forgot to ask. For some reason, she blushed every time she saw Souei, surely it couldn't be that...

"Rimuru-sama is also interested?"

"Of course I am. Moreover, you haven't reported about the situation yet..."

"Oh, about that, so basically, I used 'Sticky Steel String' a bit---"

Using 'Sticky Steel String' a bit for what---as I thought so, a sudden surge of killing aura appeared behind me followed by a loud cough.

![break]

"Ahem!"

![break]

We were whispering just now when we suddenly froze to switch back to a serious expression. As I shouted internally "Oh snap" I turned back to slime form in secret to flee, but was hugged by a pair of white and slim hands.

"Rimuru-sama, you sure like jesting around. Let's stop talking about that and discuss my brother's affair."

Oh yeah, there's also that. I accidentally went on a tangent. I would die a horrible death if Shuna got pissed. We decided to drop the small talk and contemplated seriously.

Then---although I said I would contemplate seriously, there was no way I could give an immediate answer.

"Benimaru, what do you think yourself?"

"About that, it is really too early to discuss it, that's all I can say. I think one spouse should be enough."

He did have a point. Of course he would feel bewildered to be suddenly engaged. If someone asked me to accept an arranged marriage I would definitely refuse. That might be how they did it in the old days, but we were living in ~~current year~~ the age of free love after all. Moreover---

"Basically, us Greater Majins can't bear children so easily. Some may find several partners to pass their seed and have them compete against each other, but I'm really not interested in that whole thing. That's why I don't want any concubines," Benimaru said with determination before us. Momiji looked at him with sparkling eyes.

"Which means, you won't have a harem."

Not just harem, we didn't even support polygamy. Unless the situation forced that to happen, for instance if there were too many widows, otherwise our nation did not apply such a system.

Just as I thought the whole thing was over, even more trouble emerged.

"I understand, then I will take on Alvis-san's challenge. The one who is going to become Benimaru-sama's wife will be me!" Momiji declared with motivation.

That's not how you get in a relationship---although that's how I saw it, I suspected that Benimaru had already given up and was not saying anything.

"Rimuru-sama, what do you think?"

*Why are you asking me, you can only let her do whatever she wants.*

"That's fine, I guess? You shouldn't just duel each other, rather put in effort to let the person you like fall in love with yourself. But, if he still doesn't like you, you may just have to give up."

As long as you don't become a stalker or something like that, there isn't much of a problem.

"I understand, then I'll do just as you said---"

As Momiji finished her words, Shuna cracked a smile. *Eh? Why do I have an ominous feeling...*

"I won't lose to you, Shuna-sama!"

"Same here, Shion."

Shion and Shuna said so while giving each other a smile. I was very confused, but I also got to flee from Shuna's hands.

![break]

By the way, Alvis had always been in a state of observing, it was from today onward that she began to take action and tried to win Benimaru's heart desperately. Momiji was not backing down either and went forth to battle against Alvis. The rest of the females who admired Benimaru ceased to remain silent too and joined the competition one after another. It became obvious to see that the battle for Benimaru among the female army had become more and more dire.

![break]

---From this day onward, there began a bizarre custom in Tempest Federation that was to force the person you had a crush on into submission through a display of strength.

![break]

The battle for free love thus unveiled.
