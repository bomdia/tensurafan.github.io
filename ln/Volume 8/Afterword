# Afterword

Sorry to keep everyone waiting, here I bring you volume eight.

![break]

For those who have read the Web Novel before, you will know this volume is the "Founding of the Monster City" arc. As for why the sudden title change of this volume, there is quite the story behind it---

"Ahh, I will definitely finish up suuuuper fast this time and make the story short!"

"I've heard that line far too many times already. I won't mind at this point no matter how long you want to write."

With such words echoing by my ear, I grabbed my pen to write.

And as I wrote and wrote, the deadline arrived...

"Hey, there's something I wish to discuss..."

"Right right right, what do you want to discuss?"

"About that, I've written things a bit too long this time..."

"Oh shit, here we go again. I knew this was how things would have gone," Editor I-san replied rather unfazed by it.

But there's another twist coming!

"Can I make it into two parts?"

"Huh?"

"Even if I continue to write for another hundred pages or so, all I will end up doing is getting stuck at an awkward spot in the story. That's why we should change our direction to instead make it into two parts this time, won't that be great?"

"It better be! Seriously though, how did things end up like this!"

![break]

We continued to have a very *lovely* conversation. In the end I was successful in making editor I-san roll his eyes (and agree). Nicu job!

![soft scene break]

So yeah. I've been reflecting as well.

I've got no clue why things ended up like this myself, but I'm beginning to realize: isn't it a bit too challenging for me to try shortening the story?

And so, I am currently focusing on finishing up the rest of the arc in volume nine "Founding of the Monster Kingdom". I will try my best not to turn it into a trilogy.

I look forward to your feedback in the future as well.

See you in the next volume then!
