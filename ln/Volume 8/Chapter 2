# Chapter 2: Nations and|Invitations

The news couldn't be kept a secret even if we wanted to. The rumor spread to the leaders of the nations surrounding the Jura Great Forest too quickly to be controlled.

![break]

---Hinata the Saint was defeated by Demon Lord Rimuru.

![break]

The information was released from multiple sources with great caution in order to prevent exposing the actual origin. The news was spread with much vivid description. It of course had to do with someone's conspiracy. Yet without anyone's notice, the rumors started to spread like wildfire.

No matter how secretive the attack was, it couldn't have hidden from everyone. Tempest Federation was currently right in the middle of the public eye, and so the neighboring kingdoms have been vigilant in their intelligence gathering. Given the fact that the march of the Holy Knight Order became an open secret, it only served to increase credibility of the rumor. As for the people who had received this news, there were all kinds of different reactions.

![break]

Some were fearful of Demon Lord Rimuru.

Some were angered by Hinata the Saint's supposed incompetence.

Some found it to be rather unimportant and instead focused on what they could do to keep their own country safe---some took special precautions.

![break]

Not only were there rumors flowing around; information had also been released through official channels. Hinata the Saint and Demon Lord Rimuru battled and ended up in a tie. The result of which was---

Holy Empire of Lubelius and Jura Tempest Federation signed a ceasefire and formed a non-aggression pact.

This information being as loaded as it was, there were still more pressing issues that needed to be addressed. Namely, the invitations sent out by said target of the rumors, Demon Lord Rimuru. The nations didn't really trust the information put out by the Western Holy Church at face value. This event was already beyond comprehension, the entire world has and would be shaken by its occurrence.

That was a common understanding among the leaders of the world. Although no one knew the details, the Holy Knight Order didn't appear to have sustained any casualties. This became a decisive factor to the decision making of the leaders of the nations.

Troubled by a multitude of thoughts, the Western nations became ensnared in the upcoming turmoil.

![hard scene break]

The location is the Dwarven Kingdom, the Armed Nation of Dwargon. The top officials of the nation---the ministers of every department have gathered for a meeting.

"That guy is up to no good again---"

A rather imposing voice rung in the meeting room, one that belonged to Gazel Dwargon---Hero King of the Dwarven Kingdom.

![break]

For the past few days, his covert agents have been busy. One by one they reported in and the intelligence department had been working overnight to analyze all of the information they received. They produced detailed documents and reports after analyzing video footage, making several copies before presenting them to the ministers.

The wealth of information was enormous. As a result, the number of pages in the document was staggering. It was no wonder they'd been working overtime.

Nevertheless, the current state of affairs was already much more favorable in light of what had transpired over the past few months... When compared to that time the slime Rimuru became a demon lord...

They hadn't been able to catch a breath when, right after ascending, Rimuru dueled Demon Lord Clayman in a political nightmare. It was the same for the agents, intelligence department, King Gazel and the ministers of the kingdom. All of them suffered from a lack of sleep on account of that dire situation. Thinking back to that time, the current predicament was a piece of cake in comparison.

![break]

"He...hehehe. We'll have to consider this as truth even if it's unbelievable. Your junior has defeated that Saint..." Vaughn remarked, though in response, the Commander of the Pegasus Knight Order, Dolph, a far more serious person, disciplined him, "That's extremely disrespectful of you, Vaughn. This is a public meeting room, not your own private quarters. Be mindful of where you are!"

Dolph gave Vaughn a stern warning. Vaughn on the other hand shrugged and nodded carelessly. But looking across the room and receiving nothing but critical glances from other ministers, he let out a dry cough in response.

"Don't blame him, Dolph. Even I was surprised, so Vaughn naturally couldn't have made it through the news without taking a jab at it," King Gazel intervened to break up the tension and approve Vaughn's indiscreet remark. Perhaps everyone was really just so baffled by the reports that they now lacked the fortitude to offer any criticism of Vaughn's comment themselves.

Speaking of the information in their hands, it contained the entire record of the incident from start to finish.

The content was shocking. The so-called strongest human warriors, the hundred members of the Holy Knight Order secretly launched an assault on the monster kingdom. Even the covert agents led by Anrietta, whom Gazel took pride in, only got hold of their movement in recent days. Or rather, they only started to notice after the conflict between the two parties broke out.

However, since his agents had discovered it, the intelligence agencies of other nations must have found out as well, knowing that many spies had infiltrated Tempest. Demon Lord Rimuru seemed to be aware of them already, but he simply let them be, likely for (commercial) self-promotional purposes.

With such a large-scale skirmish going on, no matter how stupid the covert agents may have been, they had to be aware of the condition---and its result:

![break]

The defeat of the Holy Knight Order.

![break]

Demon Lord Rimuru's subordinates were victorious without any casualties. Thanks to the expansive report the spies assembled, Gazel and the rest had a firm grasp upon what happened, despite not having been at the battlefield.

"Your Majesty, my subordinate witnessed the battle in person---"

As she finished, Anrietta began to give the detailed report. According to her, Hinata the Saint, and Demon Lord Rimuru seemed to have engaged in a one-on-one duel at the end. However, the magicule content of the battlefield was distorted suddenly and it interfered with all magic surveillance.

"---We also detected extremely powerful youki^[demonic aura] at the scene. I suspect our surveillance was influenced by it."

"Couldn't it just be a magicule storm that was powerful enough to interfere with the magic surveillance?"

"Jaine-sama, I don't think it was a magicule storm; instead, I think it was vast amounts of energy of opposing nature suddenly colliding that caused the interference on our signal transmission."

"Hmm, regardless, you were not able to see the result of the duel, were you? If that's the case, how did you conclude that Hinata was the one who lost?" the Court Mage old lady, Jaine, asked.

As Commander of the Holy Knight Order, Hinata was well known for her ferocity. Moreover, Jaine herself was one of many to have experienced that fierceness in person, so it was hard for her to believe Hinata's defeat to be the truth.

"This may just be some form of indirect evidence, however, for the Western Holy Church, distinguished for their hostility towards all monsters, to suddenly revoke its long-standing doctrine as well as wanting to establish formal ties with us dwarves, possibly to gauge our intent... There is no way a victorious Hinata would have allowed that. In addition, their home nation Lubelius is also changing its stance, forming diplomatic ties with Tempest Federation. They even went to inform every nation, which is basically the equivalent of an official declaration. Therefore, isn't this sudden one-eighty evidence for the defeat of Hinata the Saint?"

"Uhh... You have a point, if those stubborn-minded human-supremacists suddenly decided to change their minds on this... It means that some factor is forcing them to do so, so I suppose we can consider this. If that is indeed true, King Gazel---the likelihood of Demon Lord Rimuru having grown stronger than you has become a lot higher," Jaine said bitterly.

Although she didn't want to admit it, Hinata the Saint, and Sword Saint^[This is just a title "劍聖" (Master of Sword/Sword Sage). It's not implying Gazel's species, though he is likely a sage similar to the Ten Great Saints.] Gazel were similar in strength. If Hinata was defeated, it would imply that Demon Lord Rimuru had grown stronger than Hero King Gazel.

"That's just nonsense!"

"Jaine-dono, are you insulting King Gazel?!"

Despite the ministers' shouts in protest, Jaine remained unfazed.

*That's an undeniable fact after all*---Jaine thought to herself. Besides, Gazel agreed with her view.

"In the span of a mere few months, is it possible to achieve that much growth?" Gazel sneered at the lack of crisis awareness in Jaine's question.

*That can't just be called growth anymore!*

This situation started to genuinely worry Gazel down to his core. During their last encounter, he'd noticed that the newly ascended Demon Lord Rimuru was emitting a bizarre aura. He did not sense any sort of immense power, instead it was calm and peaceful, without much intent at all. While Gazel possessed the power to see people's thoughts, even with his Unique Skill 'Dictator'^[Annotation:独裁者 (ウエニタツモノ) I have no idea what the katakana annotation means, but a search on google shows it has something to do with Japanese parliament, still, just going with the Kanji meaning this time.], he couldn't see through everything about him. It meant that Rimuru had gotten complete control over his power.

"Indeed. He has evolved to a Demon Lord and possesses enough strength to rival me. It wouldn't be strange if he could defeat Hinata," Gazel said with much consideration. Even though the actual situation was still unclear, his survival alone was already commendable. Yet this still seemed hard for many of the ministers to accept, as they responded to Gazel rather emphatically: "But, but! How could a monster born only a few years ago even compare to your Majesty, a hero?"

"Indeed. Could there be a mistake?"

"Moreover, if that is truly the case, wouldn't Demon Lord Rimuru be way too dangerous?"

They expressed their views one after another. Gazel let out an internal sigh. If they were really considering that, then Demon Lord Rimuru would not be the only person posing a threat.

His eyes fell on the document. According to their spies' investigation, Rimuru's lieutenants also fought against the Ten Great Saints, and the report showed that the monsters under his rule did not suffer a single defeat. They fought against the humans on their own and achieved complete victory. A particularly distressing report claimed that one of them had suppressed several Holy Knights all by themselves. If they decided to trust this report, it would mean that the total military force of Tempest Federation had surpassed that of the Armed Nation of Dwargon. The magic item used to record video footage was not precise enough to make sense of the situation, which was frustrating.

![break]

The video recording device was one of their proudest inventions, achieved only through the finest dwarven technology, yet it was unable to operate in locations where magicule content was unstable. Not only that, but the video was unable to record any audio either. This information alone would not be enough to analyze the power levels of the people being recorded; trying to sort out the situation itself was already challenging enough. With that being said however, these documents were indeed important...

![break]

The footage did manage to capture some monsters that Gazel was familiar with. They were the majins under Rimuru that Gazel conversed with once or twice in the past.

*Have those guys grown stronger as well? At this point, they must be hard to defeat even with all of our nation's might...*

The ministers continued to argue about the issue, taking sides against each other about the severity of the danger. Gazel was troubled that both sides made valid points. Ignoring the arguing ministers, he began to ponder. He was considering whether to eliminate the opposition before they became too much of a threat.

*No*---Gazel rejected such an idea outright.

Demon Lord Rimuru was a reasonable monster.

More importantly, he wished for friendly co-existence with human nations. The proof of this desire was the fact that he had built a civilized town and helped humans, all while trying to cooperate with other kingdoms. Had Demon Lord Rimuru not been a monster that understood and respected humankind, humanity would have faced an unprecedented threat.

*Such worries are probably unnecessary. Kukuku, Rimuru would surely never consider destroying humanity!*

Gazel firmly believed so. Demon Lord Clayman was eliminated yet Hinata remained unharmed, this was a fact. For that alone, Gazel believed Rimuru would not be an enemy to mankind. That's why Gazel decided to laugh off the ministers' concerns.

"Hehehe, don't worry! That Rimuru is my junior. Moreover, unlike other nations we were the first to support him, thus winning his trust. Are you all wishing for me to abandon this trust and the benefits that come with it just to doubt Rimuru?" His words were infused with Ruler Haki (imposing aura) so as to intimidate the ministers. Thanks to its power, most ministers managed to regain their composure.

"I-Indeed. Now that I think about it, it is quite stupid to abandon the trading opportunities with this nation---"

"Hmm, the imports from that nation are all quite charming. Even the production of healing potions is now dependent on that nation."

"It is the same for their technological exchange, which can't be established if we don't have faith in them. So why are we getting panicked now...?"

"That's true. We shouldn't be worrying so much at this point in time."

The ministers looked at each other awkwardly and gave an embarrassed smile. Seeing their expressions, a smile emerged on Gazel's face as well. Being frank and honest was the motto of the Dwarven Kingdom, even if the other party was indeed a demon lord, that didn't warrant discriminating against them. Seeing that everyone was reminded of this, Gazel felt satisfied as well.

Rimuru had indeed acquired astoundingly immense power, yet anyone who had witnessed how he treated others in life, would undoubtedly know that he was someone worthy of trust. Right now they were on quite friendly terms with this Rimuru. Given this was the case, their relationship had to be maintained in the future.

![break]

Rimuru mentioning that he was originally "from another world" was of great importance. He also had the ability to recreate the knowledge from the other world through his overpowered skills. His stubborn desire to be a bit more sumptuous became his motivation for which he came up with all sorts of inventions. Even thinking about it made him intrigued.

Moreover, his subordinates all greatly admired this trait of his and would carry out any task no matter how (purposefully) challenging it may be. The proof was the construction of a road between Tempest Federation and the Dwarven Kingdom. It was a road that crossed through mountains and valleys, yet one that anyone could travel safely. It was monsters under Rimuru's rule who were responsible for paving this road.

His idea needed only a single command to be realized. Even things that the other otherworlders previously gave up trying due to a lack of funds or labor posed no problem to Demon Lord Rimuru. He possessed the capabilities to push his plans through forcefully and was strong enough to have many monster followers.

*It truly makes people envious*---Gazel thought.

No matter how hard the problem was, "Everyone, let's all work hard and find a solution!"---As soon as Rimuru gave such senseless speeches, the monsters under his rule would strive with all they had. Everyone would deem such an order to be natural and justified without question. That was the real terrifying side of that slime, his almost genius ability to win people's hearts. For better or worse, that demon lord was truly intriguing.

*Perhaps I'm in that guy's pocket too.*

*But that would be fine regardless*, Gazel secretly admitted to himself.

What would happen if Rimuru tried to build a world according to his ideals? To Gazel, it was a fascinating thought. He wanted to see that one day. It would undoubtedly trigger the "Tenma Great War" (Great war between Heaven and Monster). Rimuru was aware of that too, so he probably had plans to engage it. Tempest Federation was indeed strong enough to become a fearsome military power, they could stand a chance to win against the army of heaven. If it came to that, Gazel concluded he must give them his support.

"That Demon Lord Rimuru may not be related to me by blood, yet we are as close as brothers. As long as that guy doesn't lose his humanity, I intend to support him with all we have. We will welcome the arrival of a new age; a cultural enlightenment. Speak now if any of you have an objection," the imposing voice of Dwarven King Gazel Dwargo resounded throughout the meeting hall.

This was the Hero King's decision and his right.

"I support you, King Gazel. You are our big boss after all!" the military Commander in Chief Vaughn replied with a laugh.

"My liege, I am your shadow. Naturally, I will obey your decision," head of Covert Operatives Anrietta responded without hesitation.

"Go wild with your ideas. I don't have many days left at this age, so I would like to live my life to the fullest during the last period of my life, to follow King Gazel to the end of the world and until my death," old granny Jaine who had lived since the time of the first king said morbidly, yet lively. Jaine's declaration indicated her absolute support of King Gazel, no matter what.

There was also Commander of the Pegasus Knight Order Dolph. He sighed rather helplessly and said: "Since everyone has spoken, I can only clean up after them. There's gotta be someone to come out and intervene in case he^[Somewhat vague here, I think it's referring to Rimuru.] gets out of control, right?"

This type of responsibility always fell on Dolph's shoulders, but he didn't begrudge them for that.

![break]

And so---

With these heroes and highest of officials deciding on this new policy, no one could object---but that was just on the surface, the ministers still held on to some of their own doubts. Nevertheless, they would go on to publicly support the decision wholeheartedly, with the hero's decision as cover.

There was a single reason for that; as citizens of a powerful tech-nation, the cultural enlightenment the king mentioned earlier excited them greatly. As a nation, there hadn't been much progress despite their continuous efforts in technological research. Yet that demon lord had uncaringly and fearlessly pushed forward research at an unprecedented rate. The report sent by their ex-colleague Marquis Vesta supported this as well. Some even envied the freedom he had in that regard.

"How can Vesta-dono get to do whatever he wants like that?! Unforgivable!"

"I know, right?! Have you heard? It is rumored that the roads there have even had new anti-monster barriers installed."

"And streetlamps. I heard they are also developing some sort of communication device."

"Developing potions alone must not be satisfying enough, it makes me jealo---I mean outraged at what they are doing!"

Along such lines, the ministers revealed their actual feelings towards the topic. Gazel smiled wryly as he overheard their complaints. He coughed expectantly. Almost like a signal, the meeting room went silent instantly. The ministers turned their eyes to focus on Gazel.

"I've come to a decision. Our nation will trust the Demon Lord Rimuru and move forward alongside him! We will be the ones to accept and carry out the duties of preserving their technology. Even if they get defeated by the army of heaven, their technology must not be lost! This is the policy of mine, the policy of the Armed Nation of Dwargon!"

No one planned to complain about it from the start since King Gazel always put his nation first, concerning himself with its future.

The ministers all bowed their heads in expressing their agreement to his speech.

"Kukuku, trying to capitalize fully on the benefits, I see? It sounds a lot better to just say it rather than wrapping it in lofty rhetoric," Vaughn's comment resonated with everyone present.

They'd also decided to accept the proposal from Holy Empire of Lubelius, thus concluding the meeting. Some other civil officials could handle the procedures next, to form pacts with not only Tempest Federation, but also the Holy Empire of Lubelius. Although it would probably be a future matter, but these two nations would likely collaborate with Dwargon to prepare for the "Tenma Great War". It was still unknown whether this judgement was correct or not.

![break]

*But this is good enough*---Gazel thought to himself. As everything appeared to be settled and King Gazel made his leave, one of the ministers raised his hand.

"Sire, may I borrow a moment of your time?"

He hurried the individual with his eyes to report.

"The thing is this, my liege, Rigurd-dono has sent an invitation. It states that Rimuru-dono will be holding a public presentation announcing his inauguration as a demon lord to the world...he wishes for you to attend the ceremony---"

"A presentation announcing his inauguration as demon lord? What in the world is that guy thinking?" Gazel was unable to guess Rimuru's reason for this and couldn't help but ask out loud. The minister being questioned, naturally, couldn't answer either. He simply remained silent; his eyes wide open with fear.

And instead, the other ministers began to argue.

"It must be an excuse. He probably just wants to show everyone how close our nation is by inviting sire there."

"Hmm---hasn't that ceremony of his been hosted in our nation already?"

"Oh oh, so it's about that event! Marquis Vesta told me about it before. They are trying to hold a festival in order to change how people view the monster kingdom. I heard that Marquis Vesta acted as consultant in giving advice and even directing meticulously planned recreational programs."

Vaughn's eyes started to glow after hearing the ministers' intriguing words.

"Woah, that does sound quite interesting. The hotel in that country was also rather amazing. You get to enjoy taking a pleasant hot spring bath. The food was delicious and even the receptionists had great manners as well. I believe they were mentored by Vesta and thus were truly impressive. So the entertainment programs you mentioned will probably be quite interesting as well," Vaughn exclaimed, turning his eyes to Gazel, implying that he should accept the invitation.

Judging from Vaughn's look, even if Gazel didn't participate, he would probably volunteer himself in the king's place.

Gazel contemplated for a bit.

*Hehehe, that brat Rimuru. I've got no idea what's going on in his head, but he ain't the type to play nice...*

Gazel knew he was probably making an effort to have the Western Nations accept their kingdom, but he couldn't see through Rimuru's thoughts to be sure. But that's what made it fun.

Gazel was trying very hard to suppress the urge to laugh. It was after all, a difficult task trying to maintain prestige in front of the many ministers.

*That guy... He dares to set up this type of trap to give me a hard time... How bold!*

Gazel used his newfound anger to mask his desire to laugh.

"So what does your Majesty think? Rigurd-dono did say 'It won't be easy to get his Majesty Gazel to be present, but if he is willing to attend the festival, we will be preparing the finest seat in hope of his arrival.' They also seem to have informed the leaders of the other nations, so the available seats seem to be limited. He also mentioned that 'Since there will be many people attending, the venue will likely be in chaos on that day, so please respond as soon as possible,' as a special reminder for us," the minister, trembling, reported Rigurd's message to the silent Gazel.

Such a message was still considered quite inappropriate even while using a polite tone, which the minister worried may have angered Gazel. Yet Gazel didn't express anger towards such a thing. In fact, he was actually somewhat confused by how the minister could have such a misunderstanding. Gazel's Unique Skill 'Dictator' read the minister's thoughts with ease. And so Gazel spoke up to correct his subordinate's misunderstanding.

"I shall attend the presentation and take the opportunity to tour the city."

At his decisive answer, the other ministers launched another round of complaints.

"Sire! No matter how close you are to this Rimuru-dono, you shouldn't say this. I have no idea to what extent they are planning to make these entertainment programs, but it should be easy for them to at least manage one seat."

"Indeed. Moreover, it may not be clear as to how many people they are trying to invite, but the royalty and nobility from other nations shouldn't have the free time to attend just like us. I don't think they would accept their invitations so easily."

"On top of that, your Majesty, attending in person will also lead to all sorts of problems!"

The ministers did make some good points. But Gazel ignored their views outright.

"There's no such thing, rather I should say that he just has great confidence. You all only know what that guy was like from when he visited our nation before. He has changed completely since becoming a demon lord. Rimuru is being very direct with this festival, so we can expect much. Moreover, Tempest Federation has considerable military power now, so many must want to get some inside information on them. It wouldn't be strange if some people felt compelled to go check them out after receiving the invitations. As Vaughn has mentioned, the accommodation (inns) in that kingdom is amazing, so the reason why they want to get ahold of the number of visitors is likely to provide specific kinds of services according to their needs. That's how I see it."

As Gazel finished, Vaughn added on in agreement: "That's indeed true. After becoming a demon lord, he gave off a powerful aura. Besides, I'm also highly interested in what type of festival those monsters would host. Even without representing the nation, I would still like to attend personally."

Vaughn already planned to attend the festival and he had requested Vesta to get him an invitation, even if it was just for himself.

*Can't let others get the better of me*---Gazel didn't intend to back down either.

He already knew that most ministers would oppose the idea of him attending the festival in person. That's why Gazel hoped to convince these ministers so he could participate without having to resort to drastic measures.

"I will not be attending as the king either, but as his senior to instruct him in person in case he gets looked down upon by people from the other nations. We must inform the neighboring nations that the friendliest nation to Tempest Federation is us, Dwargon," as Gazel said it, some ministers began to realize Gazel's actual motive.

"I-indeed! We must be the faction with the best relationship with Rimuru, and we have to show off this point to the other nations."

"Hmm. I heard that the people from Sarion also started ingratiating themselves to Rimuru-dono after he became a demon lord?"

"Then we shall let everyone see how close he is with Lord Gazel, it will also serve as a way to keep the other nations in check."

Gazel hid his delight. He was about to add on something to make things work out even more perfectly---

"These are all minor issues. I really can't take it anymore. If we oppose his attendance, Sire will just sneak off on his own again. It's safer for us to just attend the festival as a nation^[The term here is not exactly "as a nation," but "with all of the nation, using the resources of the nation". But I think in terms of the context of the passage, "as a nation" is appropriate as well.]."

The elders from the senate seldom raised their opinion on these matters, yet now they'd given the ultimatum to the arguing ministers. This elder was probably traumatized from when the king snuck off after replacing himself with a body-double^[Refer to Volume 6.]. As a result, with the words of the elder, the attendance of Gazel and the rest was settled.

![break]

*I have a problem with that statement. But this way, I still get to attend the festival.*

The conclusion was somewhat different from what he expected, but at least he got what he wanted. Although Gazel felt somewhat dismayed, he still decided to accept the result. To the invitation of Tempest Federation, they decided to attend as a nation. As for the ministers, this result was completely different from their expectations, yet remained to be the official and final decision.

*Then I will also have to attend in that case*---is what more and more were starting to think. The venue became noisier once more.

Soon after---

A bunch of people came forth to present their wish to accompany the king to the festival, troubling Gazel in selecting his companions.

![hard scene break]

The location was the Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion.

![break]

In the Emperor's castle, there was a large beautiful and majestic garden containing a large number of rare, wild animals. The garden was maintained using a private fund from the emperor---in other words, the emperor's personal stash. The emperor enjoyed many privileges, and so he received enormous profits from them. The maintenance cost only accounted for a small portion of the funds, and so this beautiful garden was of no financial consequence.

Moreover---

The maintenance of the entirety of this majestic palace did not use a single cent of tax money. It was evidence of the unimaginable wealth possessed by the Emperor who stood at the peak of the Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion.

Two persons were currently resting in this garden. One of them was Duke Elalude. He was the father of the adventurer Elen and a key figure of the nation, whose authority and power were among the top three^[Will be referring to as "Three Bigwigs" as it is coined by Guru in the WN.].

Sitting opposite to him was another person. This individual was far more important to this nation and possessed authority well above Duke Elalude.

![break]

This person being the Emperor---Elmesia El-Ru Sarion.

![break]

According to official statements, the gender of the individual was unclear. The Emperor was born with the beauty to rival that of a female. It was declared to the outside world as such, but in reality, she was indeed a woman.

The only thing, however, was that her age remained unknown. Her elven blood was extremely pure, which, in turn, prevented her from aging. She was also a living witness to history, making it a major taboo to inquire about the Emperor's age.

Her noble appearance was also not lacking in tenderness. Often, due to her petite figure, she was mistaken for a young girl.

She had a pair of almond eyes. Her jade-green pupils looked as if they were capable of seeing through anything. Her skin was smooth like water with its white color akin to fallen snow. Her silver hair ran down onto her pink and soft cheeks. The distinctive pair of long ears with sharp tips peeked out of her silver hair. It blended with the rest of her body perfectly.

![exact fit image](image3)

She was the most authentic of the elven race---a so called "High Elf", the supreme existence.

![break]

For an instant, Duke Elalude was also mesmerized by her beauty, but considering that the fury of his wife and daughter was far more terrifying, he quickly came back to his senses. He coughed and faced the Emperor once more.

Emperor Elmesia held herself with decorum, seated on an elegant-looking wooden chair.

"Sire," Duke Elalude said, "as previously reported to you about the Monster Kingdom, they delivered an invitation to me this time."

The Duke took out the envelope from his pocket and handed it over carefully. He had already checked it to ensure it was of no danger. He was aware of the content written in it but refrained from speaking. She hated it when people revealed things without confirming it herself---Elalude knew about the temperament of the Emperor all too well. Yet still, he felt unease.

![break]

*I can't believe that guy actually got the recognition to become an official demon lord. That aside... What is the meaning of calling me to his festival?*

![break]

In fact, there was actually no need for Duke Elalude to show the letter to the Emperor as it was meant for the Duke himself. Yet the letter wrote "If you are attending, please reply with the number of attendees".

If it were asking for the number of participants, it could be interpreted as an invitation to bring whoever one wished.

Then, who should he invite? That was the problem.

![break]

It was natural to bring guards along since the Duke couldn't attend alone. Some nobles caught wind of him having a meeting there in the past, so many had stated their wish to visit as well. The topic regarding Tempest Federation becoming a new trading nation had become popular among the high-ranked nobles in Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion.

Yet nobles were not the only ones interested. In the past, when he reported the results of the meeting with Rimuru to the Emperor, she glared at him coldly and commented in annoyance: "---Oh. So you went to such an interesting place by yourself? Well aren't you a bigshot, Elalude; you must have *had a lot of fun*. Why did you ditch me and go by yourself? Let alone proclaiming yourself my envoy and establishing diplomatic ties with them. Given the significance of the matter, I would have wanted to see things for myself."

![break]

This was how it went down...

But Elalude had things to say in his defense as well. He may have visited the Tempest Federation in the name of rescuing his daughter, it was still considered the real "kingdom of monsters". Even though he had been using a homunculus, he'd had no idea what type of situation he'd run into there. He couldn't say with confidence that there would not be any danger, so how could he have invited the Emperor Elmesia to that kind of place?

Yet she still scolded Duke Elalude harshly, "With such an intriguing slime out there, I would've wanted to see it with my own eyes. I would have gotten to meet a new demon lord; in all my years, I've never encountered such a thing before. Yet you got to enjoy all of that by yourself? Do you know what 'snatching credit'^[The expression here is "抜け駆け" which means "doing something first/taking the credit of something first"] is? Even my trusted aide dares to treat me like that, what a sad life of an Emperor I am living---" Her complaints kept on firing without pause---

"---I'm so envious... Hold on a second, isn't this just too out of line? There's no knowing how much fun you had... No actually, there's no knowing how dangerous it was, so how dare you act on your own. Absolutely unacceptable!"

...Something along those lines, it was a messy meltdown.

It was more like whining than a scolding. In front of her subjects, her emotionless expression was like an icy mountain, and so people were led to believe that Emperor Elmesia was cruel and ruthless. The only time the Emperor showed the other side of her personality was when alone with Duke Elalude or with one other individual. So it could be said that the responsibility on Elalude's shoulders was particularly heavy.

*Aren't you overplaying your feigned innocence a bit too much!* Elalude always complained internally.

Nowadays his budget was frozen because of the Emperor's tantrum, and the plan for technological collaboration with Tempest Federation was put on hold. That's why he wanted to pamper the Emperor back into a good mood so he could resume preparations to collaborate with Tempest.

If he did not inform the Emperor about this beforehand, and went to attend by himself, he would definitely have pissed her off. At that point Elalude feared that the consequences would not be so simple as to freeze his budget.

The letter stated that Rimuru was hosting a presentation, but in reality, it must be some form of intimidation. The goal being to show off how powerful Demon Lord Rimuru is. There seemed to be a festival that would be hosted alongside with elaborately prepared recreational activities. It was unknown what would be included in it, but their programs appeared to be quite substantial...

Given that the event seemed rather lively, there was no way Emperor Elmesia, someone who'd been living an all-too-boring life would miss it. It was foreseeable that she would inquire about the event from start to end and interrogate Elalude if he did not report to her. The intensity of that fury would definitely be beyond his imagination.

Based on these considerations, Elalude decided not to hide anything and thus was showing her the letter now.

As he was thinking about this, Elmesia lifted her head as she finished the letter. He quickly tightened his posture. Elmesia stared at Elalude as he does so and said:

"So, what do you plan to do?"

"'*Plan to do*' meaning?"

Elalude was trying to play dumb. He knew what Elmesia wanted to say. But he couldn't point it out directly. It would make national headlines if the Emperor Elmesia were to attend the festival. Knowing the significance of such an event, Elalude didn't dare to say too much.

*I'll see what the emperor decides to do first*---Elalude thought to himself.

"Oh---are you trying to play dumb now? Did you know, Elalude, that the quality of the desserts we are importing from Yoshida-san's store seem to have improved immensely as of late. Do you know the reason?" Elmesia suddenly changed the topic. Confused, Elalude had no idea what to say in response.

"You enjoy the reputation as a prominent adviser, yet you have no clue about the lives of the civilians? How disappointing."

"My most sincere apologies, Madam. Isn't Yoshida-san the baker Madam likes, whose shop opened in the kingdom of Ingracia? Although he doesn't possess combat ability, he is still under protection due to his identity as an otherworlder. It is the first time I've heard that you've been importing desserts from this Yoshida-san's shop. What does it have to do with Rimuru-dono's invitation?"

It was always all right to ask when you didn't know.

People who weren't close to the Emperor would most definitely have lost their job if asking such, but Elalude wouldn't be affected. He knew the most genuine side of the Emperor, and that close bond allowed Elalude to question her.

"What, so you really didn't know. Elen has been buying the desserts as souvenirs for me since a couple years back. You must have not received one."

![break]

"WHAT!"

![break]

Elalude couldn't help but shout. He suffered damage beyond repair learning that his daughter Elen didn't buy any souvenirs for him.

Seeing Elalude's frustrated grimace, Elmesia laughed, satisfied, while saying: "Since I had the pleasure of seeing such a dramatic and miserable expression on your face, I won't spare any details. Allow me to explain. It seems that Yoshida-san's confectionery has been getting ingredients from someone else since then. Because the variety of items has increased splendidly, the quality of taste also seems to have increased. And most importantly, I've been getting goods from him by offering financial support," and as such, Elmesia began to explain in detail.

Elalude was aware of this person called Kaoru Yoshida. His identity as an otherworlder alone was enough to make him a target of investigation, so naturally he already knew the relevant information about him.

According to his intelligence, Kaoru Yoshida ran a dessert place called Cafe (Kissaten)^[The term here is "喫茶店" (Kissaten), it is a Japanese style cafe store that serves both tea and coffee] in the capital of Ingracia.

He allegedly didn't have any skills, but whether this was true or not remained unknown. However, his bakery skill of making dessert was top notch. It was rumored that even the head of the Freedom Association showed up to taste his food. And according to suspicious sightings, Hinata the Saint had been spotted sneaking in and out of the location. The business there seemed to be booming. This was information that even Elalude was aware of, yet Elmesia continued to gush over the tasty desserts as she continued.

"I once went out of my way to invite Yoshida-san here. Speaking of Elen's souvenir gift, that cake was extremely delicious. So I hoped to make him the appointed pâtissier of our nation. Yet I was turned down. No matter how much money I would offer, Yoshida-san was not willing to come here---"

According to Emperor Elmesia, the man named Yoshida couldn't be moved by money. So she was forced to depend solely on the limited number of souvenir gifts she had to make it through life.

*What have you been up to, Madam...!* Elalude gasped to himself. Yet given how Elalude was already feeling, what Elmesia had to say next was far more impactful.

"Recently however, Yoshida-san said that he was closing shop. Whether he is opening a new store or moving away is still under investigation... With that being said, don't you think it is a big problem to not be able to eat desserts during break time?"

"I don't think so, what is the issue?"

"Oh---how could you say such things? Elen really likes the desserts there. If we can set up a more convenient way to purchase them, don't you think she would come back more frequently?"

"Madam, w-what are talking about!"

"In fact, she has actively attended all of our regular tea parties."

A truly shocking fact. Elalude had always thought that his daughter didn't even want to come near her hometown. To him, Elmesia's series of confessions left him broken and depressed.

It was one thing that her two bodyguards had been useless, but it was an entirely different matter that the people he sent to watch over her didn't report anything of this sort.

*Those guys... I'm gonna teach them a lesson later*---Elalude asserted.

First however, it was more important to hear what Elmesia had to say.

"Now the matter is of utmost importance!"

"Right? I've actually gotten hold of some very reliable information about it using my wealth and influence."

"Do tell."

"It's really shocking, the place he wants to move to is that Tempest Federation you visited! What did you see when you last visited that nation?"

After being pointed out by her, Elalude recalled something as well. He'd heard that the dishes served by that kingdom were all delicious, and his daughter Elen was greatly moved by one of the desserts. He remembered Elen exclaiming excitedly, "As expected from Shuna-san, you were even able to recreate that new dish!"

"Ah! So that's what you are hinting at!" Elalude couldn't help but shout, to which Elmesia sighed, baffled.

"Seriously now, are you really as smart as they say?"

Hearing this, Elalude's confidence vanished with the comment: "I'm such an embarrassment..." he apologized earnestly.

![break]

The reason why his boss, the Emperor had been upset was now clear. She misunderstood and thought that Elalude wanted to have all the desserts for himself. Even though it would be for his daughter, there was no way Elalude would go to that extent.

"How would I know whether you would have done it or not; with a father's love for his daughter and all that, you know..."

Due to Elalude's obliviousness on these many subjects, the Emperor's suspicion towards him gradually dissipated. Yet this lack of knowledge turned to her mocking him of such unawareness of these important incidents.

Elalude willingly endured the blow. He then switched his mindset to discuss another thing.

"By the way, Madam. We should get back on track, how will we respond to Rimuru-dono?"

Elmesia grinned sneakily upon being asked by Elalude.

"About that..."

She was keeping him in the loop and without giving an answer. Elalude fought back his impatience, he was not stupid enough to cut in now. As mentioned before, once the Emperor moved out, it would become a major state affair. If it were initiated by Elalude, there would most definitely be some objections. Things would undoubtedly become difficult if someone tried to intervene. The powerful nation of Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion has prospered under the rule of Sorcerer King, Emperor Elmesia.

Under her were the thirteen noble houses^[The system in the source sounds more like the Japanese aristocracy, so a brief explanation with the original texts just to clarify. There are thirteen aristocratic/noble families (王家) serving Elmesia, who is part of the Imperial family (皇家). Every aristocratic has its own lord/leader (君主達). This system should be the same as the European aristocracy system, where families are referred to as houses, which is why I have translated it this way.], each with their own lord. Everyone pledged their loyalty towards the Emperor Elmesia. Basically, she permitted each house to have executive power over their own domains. The imperial house on the other hand, relied on the taxation from the thirteen vassal families.

None of the noble houses possessed any military capabilities. With all of the military power concentrated within the imperial house, the Emperor was the supreme commander of the military, responsible for mediating relations between states.

Elalude was from one of the noble houses as well. His mother Elise Grimwald has long held the top position of the thirteen houses. Elise was also the grandmother of Emperor Elmesia; yet another person that Elalude had to bow towards. Something off-topic: Elalude's brother---and Elmesia's father---was tragically killed during a battle against monsters. That was before Sarion was established as a kingdom and well before Elalude was born. To him, it was tale from ancient times. In other words, his niece Elmesia held a similar ancient status, someone who has lived far longer than Elalude. It was no wonder that Elalude couldn't raise his head in front of her.

![break]

Now, to put aside the matter of his mother Elise, let's talk about the people from the other aristocratic families... There were some mean characters among them as well.

There were lords who hid in their domains without any official duty and weren't willing to come out. Then there were those that attempted to meddle in state affairs using their authority. Some even believed that Emperor Elmesia wouldn't interfere with politics at all, emboldening them to the point that they would try to exploit opportunities in an attempt to amass power for their own house.

As a countermeasure, it was one of Elalude's duties as Duke to keep a watchful eye on them. It was precisely because of Elalude's position that he needed to act cautiously regarding this current situation.

A leisurely tour abroad may not have been a problem, but this was the monster kingdom he was going to. He feared there may be some individuals lying in wait, ready to use anything as leverage in order to take him down. Other than that, there wasn't much that was likely to happen. However, there was no way to rule out any devious assassination attempts on the Emperor. Before they could even set off, thorough preparations were an absolute requirement in order to prevent such a catastrophe from ever unfolding.

![break]

"You are worrying too much, Elalude-chan."

"Ma-madam?"

"No matter what those little boys^[The word here is "小僧" (Kozou) - Little boy] have in mind, they won't go so far as to harm me---"

The aura of Elmesia had changed. She was emitting the unique aura of a ruler. One that did not tolerate anyone's betrayal---It was the overlord side of Emperor Elmesia that the public saw.

To the eyes of Elmesia who had lived a lasting life, those cunning lords, including Elalude, were all probably like a bunch of cocky little kids.

Elalude was extremely nervous as he gulped over and over. The two were holding a familiar conversation due to their blood relation, yet the difference between the two was like heaven and earth. Despite Elalude himself being a heroic figure, he was someone of a completely different "status". It would be impossible for him to feel at ease during their conversation.

"That demon lord is called Rimuru, right? He's no opponent to underestimate."

"---What do you mean?"

Of course he's a force to be reckoned with. His personal strength alone goes without saying, yet his ability to exercise control over all monsters under his rule as well as having them obey his every order is no feat to be taken lightly. Moreover, his strategies of building cooperative relations with the neighboring nations make him an unprecedented type of demon lord.

However, this was all common sense, there was no way that Emperor Elmesia would point it out without a reason. Considering this, Elalude posed a question.

"Hehe, that demon lord called Rimuru, didn't he agree to build a road to our nation Sarion without so much as a second thought?"

"Yes. They demanded some rights, for instance tax collection for people using the road, but they are willing to provide all of the labor."

"That's precisely the point. That right alone would bring enormous wealth. Dear Elalude, you should know just by looking at me, right?"

Elmesia turned back to her friendly self and after having it pointed out to him, a sudden realization struck Elalude.

"Should I call it a 'privilege'?"

Of course Elalude had noticed as well: that what Rimuru saw value in was the "privilege". That's why after careful consideration, he was willing to negotiate with Elalude.

Yet Elmesia sneered at Elalude.

"You are still too naive. Species with longevity like us must always plan with long-term profits in mind first and foremost. Surely you should know this principle?"

"Of course I do. I've carefully considered both the toll for using the road built by Demon Lord Rimuru as well as the cost of building the road ourselves."

Despite Elmesia's retort, Elalude still answered feeling justified.

*Even though we need to pay toll, it is still a lot cheaper in comparison*---or so Elalude thought. In fact, in order to construct a highway in the Jura Great Forest, notoriously plagued by monsters, it would require enormous funds and a lengthy amount of time.

Between the border of Jura Great Forest and Sarion lay the Coscia Mountain, on top of which the aggressive tribe of tengu resided, who held disdain for whoever arrived. One could only imagine the difficulty in trying to communicate with them. Even with that problem resolved, there were still many beasts and monsters^[Here the source is stating "Bestial Monster" and "Monster" (Mamono), just a wordplay, no significant terminology change] left residing in the Great Forest.

Monsters would not be the only factor posing an obstacle: the complex terrain there was also another huge hindrance. They would need to drill tunnels through mountains and put up bridges over rivers and valleys. On top of achieving such difficult tasks, they would still need to prevent the workers from being harmed by vicious monsters.

Monumental construction efforts of that magnitude must surely force a nation to undertake a hundred-year plan. It would not be an impossible feat for a great nation such as Sarion, however, Elalude didn't think the expense spent on such construction will be earned back smoothly. Demon Lord Rimuru's proposal was more than what Elalude could bargain for given all of the amazing terms.

"How hopelessly naive."

Elalude's thoughts, however, were ruthlessly rejected by Elmesia.

"Sure, it will be hard to explore that forest. To this day we haven't done so because there is no benefit in doing that," Elmesia began to elaborate upon her thoughts, attempting to enlighten Elalude. Just as Elalude thought, given the circumstances, making back the funding of construction would be infeasible. The difficulties of doing so were numerous, yet there would be little meaning to constructing such a road.

However, that situation has changed.

For the longest time, all roads from Sarion have led to one single distant nation, the Dwarven Kingdom---the Armed Nation of Dwargon. Yet now that there was a newly emerging kingdom in the Jura Great Forest---the road would lead to Jura Tempest Federation. Naturally, the purpose for constructing roads was trade. Before, technological exchange with the dwarves would certainly help boost the nations technological advancements. But in the end, it was just not worth the effort of having to accomplish such a colossal task. With that being said, the previous order had been entirely disrupted now that the Tempest Federation appeared.

"The vast land of the south owned by demon lords has now become the domain of Demon Lord Milim, while the two prominent figures Beast King (Beast Master) Karion and Sky Queen Frey all became her followers. With the overwhelming military power to back themselves, their nation will no doubt become prosperous. There are also the Western Nations in the north-west and the Armed Nation of Dwargon in the north. Won't the relay hub of these nations be none other than the newly risen Tempest Federation?"

"---Indeed, you have a point," Elalude answered. He understood what Elmesia was trying to get at. Though that was the case, he didn't perceive any severe error in his judgement.

Suddenly he was overcome with a striking realization. As Elmesia had pointed out, there hadn't been any benefit before, yet now that land within the Jura Great Forest was creating an infinite amount of value. That nation was cluttered at the center of many distinct nations; in other words, it would become the center of cultural exchange... There was destined to be an unforeseeable development taking place in the future.

That was what Demon Lord Rimuru wanted, and because Elalude had realized that, he wanted to confirm the diplomatic tie between their nations. Yet the construction of a highway was necessarily linked with grave danger and huge monetary investments---

"My judgement was made considering that the construction work will inevitably require him to invest both funds and armed forces, it is probably more ideal to just pay the tolls and reap the benefits," was the deduction that Elalude made, in order to justify his agreement to the plan.

Elmesia's smile remained after hearing Elalude's answer.

"You have a point. Given any normal circumstances, that would indeed have been the right decision to make, with minimal cost to our own nation. Regrettably, you seem to have overlooked that these people are a long-living species, and there's a demon lord involved as well! One must always think twice when forming an accord with a permanent impact on the nation. That's why, I'll give you eighty marks for the decision."

"...!"

"We should also participate in the construction. Select some people and send them in a group to partake in the project. Leave the matter of defeating monsters to them. If we are to at least be of some help, this effort would probably make our life easier when it comes to the negotiation of the toll."

"Uhh!"

All the rights derived from building the street would now permanently belong to Demon Lord Rimuru. If they didn't provide aid, it would be hard to turn such a table around. The opponent was a demon lord after all, rendering intimidation tactics through military force utterly foolhardy...

After hearing Elmesia's words, he couldn't help but agree. Elalude was blinded by short-term benefits and failed to recognize his blunder.

"I've told you that you are too rigid in your thinking, Elalude. You did well to know that the situation would be changing, but you can't always be bound by preconceived notions."

Elalude couldn't agree more with Elmesia. His line of thought had always been that the construction would be too dangerous to carry out, yet if that weren't something one needed to consider, the construction budget wasn't really that high. Moreover, if he sent his own people to help with construction, they could hope to do some technological exchange and learn from the monsters' knowledge.

*---Uhh, just look at what I have done... I can't believe that I lacked the foresight...*

He could almost see Demon Lord Rimuru grinning from the shadows, but Elalude realized it was too late to regret now.

"By the way, don't you still need to reply to their invitation?" switching to a more serious expression, Elmesia started to speak.

Elalude nodded along in earnest.

"Whether it is the dessert shop or the rights to the road, Demon Lord Rimuru understands human society well. There is no denying his identity as an otherworlder, but more to the point, he has acquired the power and authority to apply his knowledge and experience. To put aside his status as demon lord, the person alone is already very impressive. The students of Hero Shizue Izawa---whether it is the head of the Freedom Association Yuuki Kagurazaka or commander of the Holy Knight Order Hinata Sakaguchi, both have some power in the Western Nations, yet they cannot rival Demon Lord Rimuru. We will have to participate in this event if we are to get on friendly terms with such an individual. I never had a choice from the start."

Emperor Elmesia made her decision. Elalude had no more words to say. However, something was still on his mind.

"Madam, I do agree. I'll find a way to shut the others up. But we can't ensure the security of that nation. Regarding the people to accompany you during the visit---"

They were informed that there were some conflicts between Demon Lord Rimuru and the Holy Knight Order. The conflict ended with the overwhelming victory of Demon Lord Rimuru. But unlike the time that Farmus army invaded, the Holy Knights didn't seem to sustain many casualties.

That was to show the public his confidence, though it also led to people spreading rumors about the naivety of Demon Lord Rimuru. For those who knew about the inside story, the event would shatter the will of most people trying to make a move on Rimuru, but there were plenty of fools who would still like to try. Moreover, the powerful individuals of the world could no longer ignore him, for if they did, the number of conflicts against that nation would undoubtedly increase.

![break]

*It's unlikely anything would happen to Demon Lord Rimuru, but the security there may get worse. It's fine if it is just me ~~(and the boys)~~ going, but if we are to bring Madam to that kind of place...*

![break]

These thoughts were circling in Elulade's head, but since the Emperor had made her decision, Elalude could only brace himself and prepare for the upcoming trials and tribulations.

"Send out the mediator group under the Imperial House. You are free to pick some candidates from the Magus Order," Elmesia casually said while Elalude broke out in cold sweats.

About this Magus Order, they were the high-ranked military order also known as "Knights of Purity". They possessed the qualifications to act as mediators and were the plenipotentiary agents of the emperor. All of the members were people with pure blood lines going back many generations and carried the most powerful military force of Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion---by the way, Elalude was one of them. The existence of the order was a carefully guarded state secret, yet the Emperor had generously ordered them to move out. Elalude faithfully obeyed her order with caution.

"---Understood. We will proceed with the arrangements as you wish," he answered, leaving the scene shortly thereafter. The matter of the Emperor's outing was decided and would subsequently be announced to the nation.

![break]

And so the series of sleepless nights for Duke Elalude unfolded...

![hard scene break]

The location was the trading house of the Kingdom of Blumund.

![break]

Myourmiles felt increasingly anxious not knowing when he would be finishing all of his appointments. He was a highly renowned merchant and had the ability to assess the nature of any man after just one look in their eyes. Some came here to borrow money or discuss new business opportunities, and occasionally a few nobles that had fallen on hard times would come to discuss suspicious trades. It was annoying to deal with those idiots, but sometimes they did indeed bring profitable business. That's why he couldn't hand such critical work to others.

![break]

He finished dealing with a conman-looking fellow while concerned about that and called in the next guest.

A well-dressed man entered. However, his dapper appearance couldn't fool Myourmiles's eyes. Although his clothes were made of fine materials, its design was out of fashion. This person was only wearing old clothing for show while not being able to purchase the fashionable brands. Moreover, this man would not bring Myourmiles any profit; he was an impoverished nobleman who came to Myourmiles in the hope of selling shoddy items that he proclaimed to be antiques at overblown prices. The memory of that incident was still refreshing to Myourmiles.

*He's probably come up with some new devious ideas trying to swindle money out of me.*

But he was a nobleman, nonetheless. His nobility had been confirmed after investigation, so he couldn't be underestimated. Were Myourmiles to act arrogantly in the face of real nobles, he may end up getting accused of irreverence and even lose his head. That's why his job was challenging this time.

*Eh, how troublesome. Now I've got to get my nerves tense to face off against this guy...*

While bearing this thought, Myourmiles decided to hear the person out. Unsurprisingly, he got even more annoyed after hearing him out. The proposal turned out to be devious through and through.

![break]

This man---Viscount Kazak---wished to open a new shop with his slaves, so he came to loan some money from Myourmiles.

![break]

Honestly, Myourmiles could tell it wouldn't be successful from the onset. A business wouldn't be turning a profit just because you bought some cute female slaves. It was of great importance to analyze the market and the target customers as well. It was also obligatory to find a decent location to open the shop as well as deciding on payment for the girls. However, giving such advice to him would amount to nothing more than "casting pearls before swine"^[The JP source is "马の耳に念仏" (Chanting scripture before a horse's ears)].

![break]

"Huh? It's your job to find the place. And asking me to pay those girls? What a dumb question, what kind of idiot would give salary to slaves?" Viscount Kazak wouldn't listen to anything Myourmiles had to say.

Even if forcing the slaves to work without pay was the whole point, you had to provide them with food regardless. Then there was also the clothing for them to wear and residences for them to live in that must all be planned out beforehand. The point is that buying slaves would inevitably mean a huge long-term investment. The beautiful slaves he wished to find as an eye-catching attraction could only be found among high-quality slaves whose prices were exorbitant enough to buy entire estates. Rather than having these people run the shop, he'd be better off recruiting average workers. A good example would be the shop opened with Myourmiles's investment in Ingracia. No matter how beautiful the woman may be, she would unavoidably age in the end. The money earned through them would hardly be sufficient to recover the initial investments. That is how Myourmiles saw it.

![break]

If he were trying to increase the profit rate by also providing sexual services, it could cause the spread of disease in the region if appropriate preparations were not made. Should things end like that, not only would Viscount Kazak face serious problems, but Myourmiles would also become his accomplice.

Myourmiles sighed internally, he had absolutely no desire to participate in such a dangerous ordeal.

"My my, Kazak-sama truly has a pair of wise eyes. Your humble acquaintance Myourmiles is most impressed. However, isn't the pivotal component, namely slaves, rather hard to purchase here nowadays? Since this country does not permit human-trafficking, is it not arduous to try and find any good-quality ones, when all you have to choose from are enslaved criminals^[Enslaved due to criminal acts, Okran's light shine upon thee.]?"

Myourmiles tried to turn him down to prevent trouble, but Viscount Kazak wasn't buying it.

"Oh, about that. I'll let you in on something, I've got ways around things, so if you are willing to invest, I may just tell you. But surely you get what I mean, this is some top-secret information... All I can say is that those slaves are all elves," Viscount Kazak said with an entirely serious expression.

Those words made Myourmiles feel sick to the bone. Through sheer willpower alone did he manage to maintain his composure. He was a famous merchant after all, so he couldn't just show his dislike of others on his face. The type of merchant to do that couldn't even qualify as third-class; they were a rookie who would never make their business big. Compared to that, Myourmiles was more intrigued by the elven slaves mentioned by Viscount Kazak. If what he said was true, then it was no longer some simple matter such as regular high-quality slaves.

![break]

In fact---

Myourmiles was, after all, a prominent figure in the region. Since he was the head of a syndicate, he wouldn't shy away from illicit affairs. However, he would still know where to stop before things got out of hand. It didn't mean he should be forgiven just because of that, but he still didn't wish to cross that line of extreme evil. This was how he instructed his subordinates to handle things as well. Precisely because Myourmiles was intensely familiar with shady deals, he couldn't ignore the grave danger that came with buying elven slaves.

![break]

*Did he just say elves? Those things are definitely related to a large criminal syndicate!*

![break]

Elves were a species of longevity, most of them blessed with a beautiful appearance, high intelligence, and most of them were even talented in magic as well. It was unlikely for elven slaves to have been enslaved due to criminal activities and since there was no way anyone could enslave elves that had citizenship, it would mean they preyed upon the reclusive ones living in the forest...

A realization suddenly crossed Myourmiles's mind.

Hiring monster hunters---whenever some wealthy people wished to get a classy pet, they would hire hunters to capture monsters in the forest. Yet considering the target here was demi-human, or more precisely, of the half-spirit race that elves were, most countries would not turn a blind eye towards such heinous deeds.

![break]

The Dwarven Kingdom consisted of demi-humans, and as for Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion, the Emperor himself was an elf. If this got exposed, it would lead to severe problems. Theft and fraud---it would be no petty crime like that, it bore the potential of becoming a diplomatic disaster. Myourmiles certainly didn't dare to carry out such an ordeal so uncaringly... For the goal of profit, even taking human lives would be an option while having a terrifying criminal organization behind the scene as backup... Myourmiles sensed several red flags popping up...

He drained his brain thinking, trying to find an appropriate excuse to turn down Viscount Kazak's demands. Deep in thought without any good ideas yet, there was a sudden commotion that may or may not have just helped him out of this thorny situation---

"Hey! How have you been? Myourmiles-kun!"

As they were halfway through their business, someone opened the door and entered. She was an angelic beauty with light-blue silver hair and golden eyes---wait, or could he be a boy?

"Who the hell are you, how dare you butt in on our important business meeting, ya rude piece of shit!"^[The original is just "無礼であろうが" which is arguably milder in tone, but why not.]

The voice of Viscount Kazak seemed very distant to Myourmiles. He was shocked to discover the identity of the visitor. He couldn't forget about that face, the hero who saved Myourmiles---the real Demon Lord Rimuru in person. He knew Rimuru was the ruler of the Monster Kingdom and he also heard that Rimuru wanted to become a real demon lord, at the time he was quite surprised.

Yet Rimuru really managed to pull it off. He was now a member of the 'Octagram' recognized by the other demon lords.

![break]

With that being said, Demon Lord Rimuru seemed to have taken a liking in Myourmiles. The two were very close and had even collaborated in making money. He had asked Myourmiles to find ways to sell healing potions, right now the profit margin had become quite stable. Soon after that he asked Myourmiles for a favor to help him explore the market in order to sell otherworld food such as ramen. They were now being served in restaurants and received great reviews. Later Myourmiles also helped to taste test something called a "hamburger". Rimuru made plans to open chain stores that sell them. Myourmiles also took care to handle the plans responsibly. Currently he was finding new employees, doing employee training, and attempting to arrange interior decoration for the stores. He'd been extremely busy doing preparations in all these areas.

He wanted to show his gratitude to Rimuru for all these things, but he seemed to have been busy lately. It had been a month since they last had any contact.

![break]

"Eh, isn't this Master Rimuru? Didn't you say that it is currently a critical time period and that you have no spare time to stroll around?" Myourmiles couldn't help but ask due to his shock.

Since this person---Master Rimuru, or Demon Lord Rimuru was currently busy confronting issues between himself and the Holy Knight Order. After all, he previously said it himself that "The circumstances lately may get pretty dangerous, so you better stay away for now".

There was also the Freedom Association branch leader Fuze who had been overtly frustrated over the fact that he wasn't capable of stopping Hinata the Saint himself. All of that was supposed to be the case, but how did the main person involved suddenly appear here?

---With all these thoughts crossing his mind, Myourmiles had thrown Viscount Kazak who he was just dealing with to the back of his mind. A moment later Myourmiles heard his servant running in to intervene in panic while shouting: "P-Please hold on! Our master is still in a meeting!"

Apparently, some people were still not used to it. One not used to looking at that beautiful face would quickly lose their minds over it. How uncourteous. Although it was exceptionally impolite, it was something that really couldn't be helped. Myourmiles was no exception either, if he didn't make up his mind he might easily get mesmerized as well. His face looked fine when he was talking to someone or when he was coming up with some devious ideas, but whenever Rimuru was acting normal, he appeared to be a completely different person that gave off a tender sense of affection.

Myourmiles couldn't really blame the servant for his behavior.

![break]

"Did you just call him 'Master Rimuru'?" Viscount Kazak attempted to interject, but Myourmiles ignored him. However, Rimuru seemed to have noticed the guest and looked quite embarrassed.

"Ah, sorry. So you have a guest here. Then I'll stop by your estate to wait for you there, I'll see you later!"

Myourmiles was still in a state of shock, until Rimuru's words brought him back to his senses. He felt somewhat sympathetic looking at Viscount Kazak, who just shouted "Rude piece of shit" at a demon lord.

*If Master Rimuru wasn't such a kind person... This guy would probably be a goner by now...* Myourmiles thought to himself.

The saying goes "Ignorance is bliss", but Myourmiles was still troubled about whether he would inform Kazak about this or not. While oblivious to Myourmiles's concern, Viscount Kazak continued to shout rudely.

"Oi, brat. Actually, little girl, I guess? Are you supposed to be Myourmiles's mistress or something? You barged in to eavesdrop without permission and interfered with our important business, how do you plan to compensate?"

Viscount Kazak started to spout such things as he saw Rimuru's face. Myourmiles was immediately filled with displeasure at the sound of it.

*This guy! How dare he talk to Master Rimuru in that way---*

Myourmiles was on tenterhook as he saw Viscount Kazak figuratively licking over Rimuru's body with his disgusting look.

"How impolite of me. Ah, no one managed to stop me, so I'm really sorry," Rimuru said in response and apologized, lowering his status.

Yet Viscount Kazak decided to pull rank and not forgive him.

"Oh, you are pretty good looking. Mannerism is quite important however, luckily for you I wouldn't mind giving you a private lesson on that."

In the end he only saw Rimuru's beauty and even dared to say such a thing. Now even Myourmiles was angered, his feeling could no longer be described with being "stunned".

*Why am I getting looked down on by this type of nobody...?*

Myourmiles was completely dumbfounded.

It was one thing that he got looked down on, but he went on to call Rimuru, who Myourmiles was indebted to, his mistress. He couldn't allow the Viscount to insult people like that. The behavior of Viscount Kazak had exceeded Myourmiles's limit of tolerance. Myourmiles was, however, the one at a disadvantage; if he were to get in a spat with a nobleman, he might be accused of irreverence. With that being said, there was no need to let him do whatever he wanted. Myourmiles had been acting politely because he didn't want any trouble, but if the person intended to antagonize him, he would face him head-on.

Myourmiles solidified his resolve.

![break]

"Oi, Kazak, it is you who are being rude to my benefactor. You are but a viscount, do you intend to piss me off?"

"W-What!"

"My business with you ends this instant. Do not come to me for any favor in the future!"

"Ya, ya bastard! A mere merchant dares to disobey a noble, Myourmiles, have you lost your mind!"

"Heh! Anyone who plans to collaborate with a criminal organization that may cause diplomatic issues is a certified troublemaker to me, who may even get this whole town to stink. I hope a plague bringer^[The phrase here is "疫病神" which is a common expression to describe people who bring bad fortune.] like you would scram as soon as possible."

"M-Myourmiles, you bastard! You, you've forgotten the debt of my prestigious visit before... Mark my words I'll make you regret this!"

Viscount Kazak dropped these words after Myourmiles's scolding. He saw that Myourmiles's men were coming to check up on the noise and seemed to think that the situation was no longer in his favor.

"Hmph, he belittles others even though he's no better than a nobody himself."

"E-Eh, Myourmiles-kun? That guy seems pissed, is everything okay?"

Like that, Rimuru casually made small talk with the furious Myourmiles.

*Ah, this guy is not simple after all. He may have become a demon lord, but he hasn't really changed a bit---*

Upon thinking so, Myourmiles loosened up. Afterward, he rejected all of the people waiting to meet him in the next room and chased all of them out.

![break]

There are things in this world where you have to strike while the iron is hot. Myourmiles was not stupid enough to pass up important opportunities. He was a smart and capable man who would even go so far as to check for rough diamonds in a pile of pebbles, figuratively speaking. But it was also an undeniable fact that there were things that he would sacrifice everything for. All in all, the real reason behind his actions was that he didn't wish to keep Rimuru waiting.

It wasn't because Rimuru would bring him enormous profit, he wasn't that short sighted. Rather, he saw an extraordinary virtue within Rimuru, that being how he still had his trade partner in mind despite the difficult circumstances he himself was in. It was because Rimuru was such a person, Myourmiles reaffirmed his vow to never betray Rimuru. He couldn't think of any work that could be more important than spending time with Rimuru.

*Is he up to some new devious idea?* Myourmiles began to feel excited at the thought. He was acting faster than usual and pushed all of the cases to his subordinates. A secret surge of joy flooded his heart.

![break]

And on that day---

A new opportunity arose that would put an end to the frustrating life Myourmiles was living.

![hard scene break]

Myourmiles guided me over to his manor. His butler immediately came out to welcome us upon seeing me. He must've gotten to know me after my several visits in the past.

*There's no need to be so courteous*---that's what I told him every time.

Myourmiles didn't seem to mind either and gave his servants the instructions with a smile. As usual, he had ordered desserts and tea for me.

"Ah, I'm really sorry, I seem to have interfered with your work."

Myourmiles gave off a wry smile upon hearing so.

"No way, no way, Master Rimuru. I wanted to settle things with that bastard long ago. He used his position as a noble to burden me with difficult cases every time..." Myourmiles began to complain to me with a ghastly expression.

Oh, so that perverted guy was a nobleman?

Now that I was able to completely suppress my aura, I could show my face directly when visiting human towns. It was rather convenient since I broke my mask again the day I became a demon lord and hadn't gotten around to fixing it yet. That's why as soon as that mister saw my face, he must have mistaken me for a young girl. But I wouldn't lash out over such minor things. Unlike Veldora or Shion, I knew how to read the situation. I kept an extra eye out having noticed how arrogantly he was acting; it seemed that was the right call. Speaking of which, since Myourmiles cut ties with him, maybe I didn't really need to worry so much.

"That noble promised to set out for revenge, isn't that kind of bad?"

"Indeed, considering that man called Kazak is hard to deal with. Speaking of his proposal this time, he is trying to use slaves, even elven ones..."

"Elves?" I asked out of surprise.

Speaking of elves, there were many of them at that nightclub in the Dwarven Kingdom. I also heard that Elen had an elven bloodline, but they were not considered to be monsters, rather demi-humans. Legally speaking human-trafficking was banned, so wasn't that just straight up criminal activity?

"Wouldn't that make him---"

"Yes. It would be a crime. That man planned to make me an accomplice. Although I've done some bad things in the past, I've not been stupid enough to capture and enslave elves."

"So it is indeed criminal. What would happen if it gets exposed?"

"That is hard to determine. Despite how the man looked, Kazak is still given the rank of Viscount. Blumund is a small kingdom, so there aren't that many noblemen. Even suckers like him have considerable authority."

I couldn't believe that man just now was a Viscount. Well it was no wonder that he would call me rude, but if that were the case, he would be a higher-ranked nobleman than Fuze's friend Baron Veryard. It was no surprise Myourmiles said that he's hard to deal with.

"Is it really okay?"

"No problem, I'm an underworld boss after all. There's no need for Master Rimuru to worry, I can sort things out with my own power!" Myourmiles responded to my worries with a smile.

What underworld?! Where is such a place in Blumund even?!^[There is a pun here in the source and I tweaked it a little bit. "暗黑街" is the phrase used to describe "underworld", which directly translates to "Dark Alley". And the source here is saying "Where is such an alley in Blumund even?"]

I guess he was referring to the slum, but that place was heaven compared to the environment where Youm grew up, considering that the Kingdom of Blumund was a nation with relatively good public order. However, I still had to give him some words of advice.

"Hold on, hold on, you really ought to be more careful since I'm here to give you an important job."

Indeed, I'd consulted many things with Myourmiles. If he ended up getting harmed because of grudges held by some strange noble, I would be really troubled.

"Wahaha! Rest assured. I, Myourmiles, have a lot of confidence in my good luck. After all, even Master Rimuru is in such a good relationship with me!" Myourmiles laughed out loud seemingly wanting to dismantle my worries.

![break]

*I've been defeated, but that's why I like him. It would be too late if something happened to him, so I should send out a bodyguard beforehand to protect Myourmiles, I just have to make sure he doesn't find out.*

I thought to myself while facing the laughing Myourmiles.

"By the way, Master Rimuru, why have you come here today?"

Upon being asked, I recalled my reason for visiting.

.........

......

...

We planned to gather all the monsters from the Jura Great Forest and the leaders of human nations to host a large-scale celebration.

The name of it was---"Tempest State-Founding Festival"^[The phrase for "State/Nation Founding Festival" is 開国祭, which can also be interpreted as "Opening up country for the public festival", hence for convenience I'll be referring it as "Opening Festival" for short.].

The date of the event had been officially decided. Now that we'd made peace with Hinata's party, all of the worries were gone with the wind. The date of Youm's coronation had also been settled, which on the one hand was in hope that he would come to support us during the festival and on the other to promote his crowning to the neighboring nations.

Right now Rigurd and his men were working intensively and sending out invitations to the leaders of the world.

In addition, Rigurd's men were not the only ones working hard. The monsters under my leadership had all heard of the incoming national celebration; everyone was excited, and all my executives had also come up with plans which were announced afterwards.

![break]

Let's take Shuna as an example, who was preparing a variety of new dishes to serve to the visitors. Moreover, she was working tirelessly to create colorful cakes in an effort to open up a cafe of her very own in my nation. I'd also introduced the renowned pastry chef Yoshida-san from Ingracia, who took care of me back then, to Shuna. It was a futile effort to try and convince Yoshida-san to open a store in Tempest. He wouldn't budge no matter how many times I tried to convince him and regardless of what I offered, yet he couldn't help himself once he met Shuna. ~~(Kaijin: Get in line!)~~

"I-I received many people's care when I opened my store here in Ingracia, although I'd love to help you all, leaving this place is still..."

"I hope you may kindly make an exception on that part."

Shuna bowed her head politely to request the favor. Her hands folded beautifully as she bowed, the elegance of her movements was mesmerizing.

Yoshida-san tried to play cool on the surface, yet he was totally wrecked on the inside. It looked like we were about to finally win him over...

"---Uh. There is no chance you can beat me with seduction. If you truly wish for me to move no matter what, then show me how excellent your ability to cook is! If you can make dishes that would satisfy me, I may just reconsider things."

![break]

Due to Yoshida-san's proposal, the whole thing turned into a culinary showdown somehow. But it didn't pose a problem at all. Shuna's culinary skills were, after all, top-notch, to which everyone would agree.

"Shuna-san, go ahead and demonstrate your mastery! Make your best dishes and this arrogant cafe owner will surely run out of words of praise!"

"Yes, I understand!"

"Oi oi oi, master, who is supposed to be this "arrogant cafe owner" now..." Yoshida-san complained to me, which I ignored completely.

Shuna was highly motivated. Yoshida-san's art of cooking ignited her fighting spirit. She used the kitchen to prepare dishes beyond simply "delicious". The dish was---Tamagoyaki^[Or Tamago (玉子焼き), Japanese style rolled fried egg, the phrase used in the passage is "卵焼き"].

This was the ultimate delicacy that is rumored to show a chef's skill from its making alone.

Yoshida-san gulped as he saw her serving the dish. He then began to use a fork to silently place the tamagoyaki inside his mouth.

"Delicious!!"

Instant KO.

After having a taste of Shuna's overwhelming culinary skill, Yoshida-san finally recognized her.

"Thank you."

A smile emerged on Shuna's face. That became the fatal blow. Her smile dove straight into his heart, to which Yoshida-san had completely fallen for.

"Tsk, it can't be helped then! This is my special treatment for you!" the brawny man promised Shuna with an awkward smile. Against the cute girl with light pink hair that was Shuna, I think he was completely mesmerized---or should I call it love at first sight, I'd better keep that to myself. Since he was making an effort to play it cool, it would've been quite pitiful had I pointed it out.

And so, Shuna and Yoshida-san became good partners. Our business would definitely be going through the roof. I had a feeling that they would become the center of attention.

![break]

There was also Gabil. He seemed to have been collaborating with Vesta in hosting a presentation reviewing the history of the healing potion. They didn't intend to publicize any core technologies and their intentions seemed to be focused on attracting people who were interested and would volunteer to participate in their research plans. Right now there were already enough people, but they were simply trying to find those who are passionate.

It was no exception for Kurobee and the eldest of the three dwarven brothers, Garm. They would all be showcasing their proud work.

![break]

Gabil and Vesta, Kurobee and Garm.

![break]

I heard that the two pairs would be displaying their exhibits next to each other and compete on the grounds of who could attract more guests. It was wonderful to see that they were having fun with their friendly rivalry during the festival.

![break]

Kaijin would also return sometime around the festival.

As for Geld, I told him to take a vacation, so the construction work would probably be put on hold for now.

I also told him to give a vacation for the captives as well, so they would probably be hosting a feast on that day too.

Inevitably some people had to work during the holidays, so we made special arrangements to have them rotate so that they didn't have to work the entire time. The feast was planned to last for around a week, so I hoped everyone could have fun.

Speaking of which, Shion wasn't falling behind either, she seemed to be planning something as well.

"Hehehe, please look forward to it, Rimuru-sama!!"

Seeing how confident she looked, I was both looking forward to it and worried at the same time.

In addition, it was the same for Veldora---he had made some bold declaration again. I gotta think of a way to resolve it before he gives anyone around him any trouble...

![break]

Given what my companions were up to, I figured I had to do something as well. And the person who then came to my mind was Myourmiles-kun here.

.........

......

...

A servant entered to serve us black tea. Because of my previous visits, he had gotten more skillful and had prepared the desserts that I like.

I cracked a smile after sipping the black tea. It was tasty as always and could be used to switch up my mood. Let's talk business then.

"Ah, it's really nothing, just that I've got some work here that needs your favor. A piece of cake really, it should be easy peasy for Myourmiles-kun."

"Hehe---have you got some new idea? Young Master's commission has always been interesting, if equally as exhausting."

![exact fit image](image4)

Myourmiles responded to my words with a smile. Although he claimed them to be exhausting, his expression clearly stated his interest in my proposal. We were after all working on the "Fast Food Chain Expansion Plan" to sell food items such as hamburgers. I'd handed that initiative to Myourmiles for his help in executing it.

Earlier, due to the movement of Hinata's party I let go of the plan temporarily, but I was still rather mindful of its progress. In some sense I was checking up on it here since I planned to open that fast food store during the festival.

"Hehehe, don't put it that way, Myourmiles-kun. Regarding the plan I handed to you previously, before shops are set up in Blumund and Ingracia, I hope to open up a shop in my own kingdom to experiment."

"Oh oh, I was just wondering where to put the plan into practice, so the proposal came just in time. Speaking of which, since you've come to make the proposal, does it mean that the problem with the Holy Knight Order has been resolved?" Myourmiles asked worryingly hearing my words.

It seemed that I caused him some unnecessary concern. But even though we were no longer in conflict, the problem of the doctrines of Luminism would still remain. If we were to act in the Western Nations in the future, we could not have ignored the problem of Western Holy Church. Yet this issue had been resolved nowadays, so there was nothing to worry about.

"Hehehe, it's already been resolved. I've made peace with Hinata and Ru---"

"Ru?"

"Rules! Yep, I mean Rules. We believe it was necessary to have a charter of rules and negotiated with their party. So everyone has made peace with each other."

"Oh oh, I see! Huh, I thought that organization of Western Holy Church would have been a bit scarier. I didn't expect them to be so understanding, have I perhaps been worrying too much?" Myourmiles smiled reassuringly upon saying so.

I gave off a forced smile while thinking "That was too close, too close", wiping off my imaginary cold sweat in secret. Just now I almost spelt out Luminas's name. If I had done that, even I would've come to be resented by Luminas. That alone may have been fine, but it was possible that even Myourmiles would be silenced because of it.

The Founding Festival would not only be welcoming Hinata and the Holy Knights, but even Luminas, so I had to be careful with my words. But, whether that arrogant Demon Lord Luminas would attend or not was still unknown.

"Why should I attend such a tasteless festival?"

That did seem like something that gal would say. If she were really coming, reception would probably also take a lot of hard work, so would it be better if she just didn't come?

*Yep, you'd better not come...*

![break]

"Then I'll show you the progress of our training before officially opening stores!" Myourmiles delightfully cut in as I was halfway through thinking about the ordeal with Luminas.

Since I wasn't even sure whether she would come or not, there's no point in worrying about this type of people. I decided to discuss more seriously about the things I intended to push forward.

"Then, has the training been going smoothly?"

"Of course it has. Now they are trained to the point where they can do anything with some level of professionalism."

"You sure are capable, Myourmiles-kun!"

Myourmiles and I locked eyes, and both gave off a chuckle in secret. It seemed that the plan has been proceeding nicely, then there shouldn't be any issue with holding the grand opening during the festival.

"Regarding the shop-opening this time, should we be selling hamburgers, hot dogs, French fries and all types of juice?"

"Good idea. We will be able to attract plenty of customers with that barbecue kabob and its secret sauce alone. If we are selling them with rice balls, the sales would definitely increase."

"Has the kabob been getting good reviews?"

"It has secretly become popular among the employees already."

Myourmiles nodded deeply and commented that the barbecue kabob with cow-deer and chicken-duck^[I still don't know what to call this breed. Cow deer and chicken duck, very epic.] had been receiving good reviews.

"All right! Let's put that in the menu as well. By the way, are there enough people?"

"About that, right now I can imagine a scale of around twenty shops. Although it will cost a lot of money, it is reasonable considering that we will need employees to rotate, so a training fee would be a necessary expense. Given that to be the case, we should have plenty to spare in order to open stores in five different locations."

As expected of Myourmiles, he really got my idea and didn't even spare any expense on training talent. Considering this---

"If that's the case, I'm embarrassed to ask, but could you help prepare five people with the best culinary skill?"

"Five people? What do you plan to do with them?"

"The thing is, I have a friend called Veldora---"

"V-Veldora!"

"About that guy, he's been very enthusiastic about opening a takoyaki booth."

*Was I thinking too much or did Myourmiles's face contort during my explanation?*

"I-I see..."

While replying to me, he had begun to sweat profusely. I was slightly concerned but carried on with my explanation.

"Given that's the case, wouldn't it be quite unsettling to have him handle the shop all on his own?"

"P-probably---"

"That's why, Myourmiles-kun, I hope you can send five of your best chefs to assist Veldora!" I said with a big smile plastered across my face.

Having pushed all the troublesome things to him, Myourmiles tilted his head upward and called out to ~~Veldanava~~ the lord above^[The source states he just "ask the sky/ask above", but basically a bruh moment for Myourmiles.].

"The personal...uh regarding the personal safety of the people who would be assisting, is it assured?"

"Of course! Just talk to me if anything happens. I'll definitely give that guy a good scolding if he tries to act stubbornly again."

"I believe you would. But, about that, is this Veldora you mentioned that 'Storm Dragon'-sama?"

Indeed he was. Wow, even Myourmiles had heard of the name Veldora.

"Is there something wrong?"

"I guess... It's not really a matter of right or wrong, I'm picturing how everyone would be unable to work, given that they would have already been scared to death by the time..."

![break]

*Ah, you have a point. That's indeed true, to the uninformed, they may actually be afraid of Veldora. He's a catastrophe level threat after all...*

![break]

"Uh---so I guess it wouldn't work out?"

"I suppose you can put it that way... At least use an alias so everyone can help without knowing---"

*That's it!*

"That's it, Myourmiles-kun! Let's give him an alias to prevent anyone from finding out his real identity!"

"Eh? Would that actually work?"

"Piece of cake, I'll just tell him 'Do it or no deal'. Right, let's do just that. I'll be sure to give an extra reward for the five, so please help me relay the message and let them know that I look forward to working with them!"

![break]

I was greatly pleased with how the issue was resolved and didn't give a second thought about Myourmiles's shock.

Veldora's stubborn tantrums were nothing new at this point, but there were important figures from various nations attending the festival this time. It would be embarrassing if any of them got food poisoning during the event, so I had to assign verifiable supervision and have people watch over him in order to be reassured. On the one hand it would be too pitiful to reject him without reason, but on the other hand it would be terribly nerve-wracking to let him handle everything by himself. All things considered, I was quite lucky that the people found by Myourmiles had already been trained.

Myourmiles seemed to have something to say, but I doubt it was something important. That's why I should just let him handle all of these things whenever they come my way...

![hard scene break]

Rimuru appeared to be in a very good mood after "resolving" the issue. While on Myourmiles's end, he felt as though he just had a giant bomb forced onto him, his mind couldn't be eased.

*C-can't believe it is Veldora-sama. I've heard that his seal was broken, but I never imagined I would have to cross paths with him one day...*

Myourmiles was getting a major headache at the moment. It was fine at the start when Rimuru first came to discuss things with him. Setting up a stall may be a good practice opportunity, but it was a whole other matter if they had to surveil Veldora. Myourmiles knew things had gotten serious, but seeing Rimuru laughing in front of him with a relieved attitude convinced him otherwise. Perhaps he should just let it slide, after all, he'd been striving to live a life free of regret ever since he was rescued by Rimuru. Myourmiles was cunning, and somewhat greedy, but bold enough to do these things.

![break]

"Speaking of which, if you are hosting a festival at such a large scale, there are probably going to be a lot of participants. From a businessman's perspective, I think this would also be a great opportunity to make some cash," Myourmiles muttered unconsciously.

Traveling merchants, adventurers and so on, there would be many people coming in and out of Tempest Federation. Moreover, given the plans to put on a pageantry, the neighboring villages and towns would likely be coming to join the festival.

*This is indeed a tremendous opportunity to make money*. He mumbled to himself as the thoughts swirled in his head...

"Oh? Is Myourmiles-kun interested too? Hey, heeey. Honestly, despite how I look, I can relate to how you feel. I've already had you working on the merchandise we are selling, but I also wish to have some main featured products for our nation."

Rimuru sipped on the black tea he was served. He must have overheard Myourmiles's words and taken the look on his face as "Please consult with me".

"A main feature, is it?"

"Right, right, eh, speaking of our town, we are planning to turn it into a health resort. We've already prepared hot springs, inns, and hotels to receive noblemen. My only gripe is the lack of recreational facilities."

"I see..."

All right, Myourmiles had decided to listen to his plans.

Picking up on how Myourmiles reacted, Rimuru began to explain with joy.

![break]

The content was as follows---

Many high-grade inns were built in Tempest Federation, which Myourmiles had already checked into before so he was quite familiar with them.

You would find all sorts of facilities for overnight accommodation in those places while experiencing a variety of different themes. There were inns where you could enjoy a beautiful garden scenery and meals at the same time, while others might offer open-air hot springs as well.

It may be different for large nations, but in smaller nations, even noblemen would find it challenging to sustain a personal bathing pool. For nations without a tap water system, filling the bathtub to boil water alone was a difficult task. For Myourmiles, this was almost common sense, that's why he could only use "astonishing" to describe having hot spring facilities that were open for use at any time...

Yet Rimuru was still not satisfied.

![break]

"But, even if that's the case, is it really enough for a health resort to have delicious food and space to relax?"

Myourmiles agreed that it was indeed the case, but Rimuru shook his head.

"You are too naive, Myourmiles-kun. We can absolutely do better than that! I want there to be some programs so everyone can have more fun. For instance, let's say---"

Approaching the topic, Rimuru brought up a so-called sightseeing tour of Jura Great Forest as an example. The program entailed sending guides as well as guards to accompany people on a day-long walk deep into the forest. Other programs would include fishing competitions near the neighboring rivers, hunting conventions so as to get in touch with nature, etc... The items required would all be available for lease; this way he hoped the registered guests would all be able to have fun.

"It sounds quite interesting. This may very well pique the interest of nobles with too much free time on their hands. Also, the ones that are often very busy will surely find this to be a welcome break and a breath of fresh air."

"Will they? That's fantastic. I was contemplating if there are any other programs we could set up for everyone to have fun."

Rimuru hoped that the Founding Festival would convince some guests to return in the future for more consumption. For this to be a success, he had come up with a multitude of programs in hopes that the guests wouldn't get bored.

![break]

*Just how far into the future has this guy planned...* Apart from being utterly baffled, Myourmiles was also impressed.

"How about we take a page from the Kingdom of Ingracia's book? The theatre in their capital seems to be quite popular, I've even heard that they put on an opera and a drama every day. In addition, the martial tournament hosted at the colosseum is rather prominent---"

"Oh-OHOH! Is that the one? I heard that there is a 'Masayuki the Chosen Hero' who is very popular."

"Indeed, indeed. Masayuki-sama has the title 'Shining' and has dominated many martial tournaments. Despite how I may look, I'm actually a super fan of his."

"Ehh!"

It turned out Myourmiles was an idolater too. Completely overlooking Rimuru's repulsion, he enthusiastically set out to ramble about the tournament.

...

"---(He has spoken a ton already) so that's how it was, since nobody could grasp the pattern of his sword swings, it's what earned him the title 'Shining'. They would also fight to the death against captured monsters. The Chosen Hero's companions are also very strong, yet I was so nervous that I got sweaty palms while watching that time. If there is some recreational program like that... Ah, I'm way too passionate about it. Speaking of which, Master Rimuru's subordinates also all seem like powerful individuals, I wonder which one is the stron---"

"STOP! I won't allow you to continue anymore, Myourmiles-kun."

Myourmiles's interest apparently moved on to Rimuru's subordinates---in other words, Benimaru and the rest. That included Rigurd, who he had met several times, his body of muscle didn't seem to be just for show. He'd also laid eyes on a bunch of other strong-looking majins, he must have always wondered which one of them was the strongest.

Myourmiles took the chance to ask Rimuru but was stopped.

"Listen closely, I will only tell you about it here---" Rimuru said, then whispered to Myourmiles, "---If you are to say these words in front of those guys, there will no doubt be armed conflicts. Speaking of which, there was an asshole Holy Knight called Arnaud in the past who asked the very same question you just did ~~perhaps in another version of this story~~^[As happened in the WN equivalent, during the reconciliation banquet.]. Later my lieutenants, one by one, began to argue over rankings and boring topics which almost led to serious conflicts. At the time, not everyone was present, so we managed to settle the matter peacefully, but be warned, you should not say such things that will provoke conflicts."

Rimuru added that it was fortunate that those who were most likely to cause trouble happened to not be present, and so he was able to muddle through. But since then, they'd been deliberately avoiding that sensitive topic. If those executives started a serious quarrel, the town they took so much effort in building would become a victim as a consequence. Such an outcome should be avoided at all costs and so Myourmiles was advised to be cautious with his words.

"I-I see. Apologies for my offense."

"It's fine as long as you keep an eye out for it. But, it's a rather peculiar viewpoint nonetheless."

Unlike the fearful Myourmiles, Rimuru didn't seem to particularly take it to heart.

*This person's values surely are different from any average person's*---Myourmiles thought to himself while quietly waiting for Rimuru to speak.

"There's another empty block in the town, it should be pretty nice to prepare an opera house there. It may turn out that someone is aspiring to become a playwright; it will also complement the new recreational activities. Now regarding a colosseum---"

Rimuru turned to Myourmiles.

From Myourmiles's point of view, Rimuru seemed to be grinning. *Ah, he must have gotten some devious idea again*---that's what he thought, but decided to keep his mouth shut.

![break]

*Master Rimuru, you are an absolute beauty when you are silent, why do you have to put on this deplorable expression...*

![break]

He was thinking something along that line.

"Myourmiles-kun!"

*Here it comes*! Myourmiles's heart tensed up as he engaged Rimuru.

"W-What is it?"

"You seem to be intimately familiar with the whole martial tournament thing?"

Rimuru got up off his chair and moved next to Myourmiles. He whispered next to Myourmiles's ear while giving off a perfect voice of coquetry. And then, he suddenly announced---they wished to host a martial tournament as well and hoped that Myourmiles would help with the arrangement.

"Please hold on, young master! It's far too late to suddenly tell me about such an important thing..."

"We will be preparing the colosseum, could you help me investigate what is required to host a tournament?" While ignoring Myourmiles's protest, Rimuru informed him one-sidedly. Given it had already reached this point, there was no use in resisting.

"Every single time, I can never win against Master Rimuru. I understand. Yours truly, Myourmiles, will sincerely attend to the matter with all my effort!" Myourmiles promised rather helplessly.

But he said so with a thinly veiled smile... Honestly, Myourmiles didn't dislike it. Or rather having entrusted him with such a monumental task, his joy was through the roof.

*What do you need in order to host it?* Not only will he need to investigate, Myourmiles also needed to put his ideas into practice. Never in his life did he dream to be tasked or even work on such a large-scale proposal.

![break]

*I've got to do this one well! T-This must be a once in a lifetime opportunity!*

*It doesn't matter even if it fails*, Myourmiles pulled himself together.

![break]

Regarding people like Rimuru, from Myourmiles's past experience with him, he realized that minor things wouldn't be enough to anger him. Moreover, he kept his promises and was worthy of trust. To a merchant, trust was the most important thing, and Rimuru was the type that garnered people's trust organically.

Just like he had promised, he would definitely prepare a colosseum. Although it was hard for Myourmiles to wrap his mind around it, Rimuru had complete control over the monsters he ruled, they would serve and obey any order he gave.

![break]

*Even though that's how he acts, Master Rimuru is still a demon lord. If this proposal is lucrative, it wouldn't be difficult to gather the necessary materials. And to have me to work on the plan---*

![break]

Myourmiles was extremely moved. While entranced, the joyful voice of Rimuru entered his ear.

"Right, by the way, even though our goal this time is to receive leading figures from different nations, we are allowing normal civilians to attend alongside them. Like in the Kingdom of Ingracia tournament, if you can't involve the public, there isn't really any benefit to reap, is there?"

"Do you mean the average public?"

"Hmm, I plan to build a colosseum that can seat around fifty-thousand people^[For reference, the Roman Colosseum could hold around fifty to eighty thousand as well.]. There is still a lot of empty land left, so it shouldn't be an issue. In the surrounding area we will be opening the fast food stores we just discussed. Sounds like we could generate a lot of sales, right? Wouldn't there be cash flow when there's human flow? We should be expecting a lot of tourists. What do you think, Myourmiles-kun?"

In other words, Rimuru was saying that they would normally be providing recreation that the average public could also afford, maximizing their customer base...

*What do you think, Myourmiles-kun?* Upon being asked this, all Myourmiles could answer was: "That's beyond my imagination." By constructing a colosseum large enough to hold fifty-thousand people, it would be able to rival the one in Ingracia. Or rather, it would be able to accommodate around five times as many spectators. Rimuru had to be really serious about this.

"We can have a standing area for people to watch from, that one we won't be charging anything for. When it comes to the rich, we will direct them to the designated seats and charge entry fees. As for the nobles who are generous with their cash, we will offer them the VIP seats. Then we will prepare box seats for specific guests. Those are my thoughts on it; I hope you can help work out the profit margin per seat, to settle on prices."

And with that, Rimuru dumped all the work onto Myourmiles with a smile.

![break]

In order to allow peasants and townsfolk from the neighboring kingdoms to watch the fights as well, he was preparing areas that don't charge money---that's something even the kingdom of Ingracia wasn't doing.

So that's why they'd planned it like that, Myourmiles finally understood.

"I see, I was just about to say that fifty-thousand people are too much, so that's how it is..."

"Right. This type of event only has value when it draws everyone's interest. Wouldn't seats be more valuable when you can sit elegantly while a bunch of others can only stand and watch?"

"Indeed it does. Reserving seats ahead of time would remove the risk of missing out on one entirely, it's definitely worth it."

![break]

The colosseum in Ingracia acted solely as entertainment for the wealthy, the concept for Rimuru's was fundamentally different. All in all, its main purpose was to garner attention for the tournament in order to draw in huge crowds.

![break]

Myourmiles mulled things over and came to admire the idea. If an entry fee weren't required, peasants during slack season would probably join the fun. As the news spread through these people, average citizens from nearby countries would get interested as well. The point is, if the population of people flowing in exceeded tens of thousands, the inns in the streets would no doubt make a lot of money. It would also be quite interesting to open up the fast food stores as mentioned by Rimuru on the way to offer a place to rest.

Moreover, they could also serve the tourists and provide them with a residence to stay at. If Rimuru was able to monetize them though the restaurants, inns, or hot spring in the town, running the colosseum would be extremely profitable... He couldn't help but imagine how the money spent by the people being attracted there alone would fill their pockets.

"As expected of master, you've calculated it from the start..."

"Eh? Ah, I-I guess so. Yep, it's all part of my plan!"

"It seems that you have plenty of facilities to accommodate people over night. Then the problem will be ensuring regular demand later on, because if we can accomplish that, our profit margin would no doubt skyrocket. Anyway, let's do promotion first. Then our next step is the proposal that you entrusted me to work on?"

"Eh, yep. That's it."

"I see, I see. It will be my job to come up with entertainment that would draw everyone back... Even if the martial tournament this time does not generate any profit, we will make the guests return regardless---if we manage to convince the customers to return, would it mean that our plan was successful?"

"---How impressive that you read my thoughts so well. As expected of Myourmiles-kun, you are the only one suitable for the job!"

The proposed martial tournament that would be used to garner crowds made Myourmiles shiver in excitement. Rimuru said that arrangement and planning would all be handed to him.

*This is too intriguing!* Myourmiles wanted to shout, but he endured.

"He...hehehe, that's making things rather hard on me---"

"Wouldn't such a thing be better handled by the hands of the professional? Myourmiles-kun, could it be, that you are not confident in yourself?"

"HA-HAHAHAHAHA! How harsh, Master Rimuru is quite mean."

"Hahahaha, right, right. But if it's Myourmiles-kun, surely you can handle it easily, can't you?"

The two started laughing out loud. Both giving off a devious expression.

"I mean, then you will be mobilizing a lot of money! Surely you are aware of that?"

"Hehehehe, please be reassured. I am best at dealing with money. So I will definitely arrange the best result for Master!"

"That's most certain. I see that it is the right choice to leave the matter to you."

As they laughed, Rimuru and Myourmiles shook hands with each other.

The event would cost a lot of money. It would be hosted in just the way Rimuru described.

![break]

*Seriously, this guy is terrifying*---Myourmiles thought to himself.

It was horrifying alone to not know how far ahead he had already planned. Myourmiles proceeded to plan out the ideal blueprint in his mind, even though he still had that concern in mind.

"If that is the case, we will have another new usage for healing potions. No matter how severe of an injury they sustain, as long as they don't die instantly, won't they all be healed? That means that it won't matter if the contestants get serious. Moreover, wouldn't it be super effective for promotion if we claim that the injured participant would become fully healed in time for the next match?"

"What do you mean?"

"Ah? Have you not considered that?"

"Hmm yeah...of course I have! I just want to confirm whether your idea is any different from mine, that's all!"

"I see! Hehehe, if it is Master Rimuru, surely such minor matters would be within your expectation. I've got to catch up to you," Myourmiles continued to express his view.

Then they started to talk to each other in "Right! Yes!" and began to discuss all sorts of ideas.

![break]

First was the use of the martial tournament to promote the healing potion to sell to the adventurers. Second was regarding the lending and selling of weapons and gear.

"Speaking of the weapons made by Kurobee, even failed works of his will possess incredible quality. And though they are not good enough to debut on their own, he has trained many disciples---"

It would be fine however to sell items crafted by those disciples, Rimuru suggested. That's why he hoped they would give it a try. Other things include, for instance, running a casino, which would be part of the national enterprise. There seemed to be one running in the Kingdom of Ingracia. Enormous profits would be made just through betting on a winner alone. Not only human versus human, it would be interesting to have captured monsters fight them as well. Of course, there was a need to ensure safety, but right now there were many strong subordinates under Rimuru that could be put to use. That's why Myourmiles wasn't worried at all that it would pose a problem. Or the colosseum could be used as a practice field for rookie adventurers and lend the venue. They could deploy coaches and allow customers to pay for their instruction.

Myourmiles's head was spinning at a formidable speed, he felt that ideas he had never had kept flowing in. With the help of Rimuru, he was able to come up with countless fantasy-like proposals.

![break]

*There are so many ideas*. On one hand he felt that he had been entrusted with a great responsibility, on the other hand he was also immersed in excitement. Apart from shivering, Myourmiles had made up his mind.

"I'll do it then. I'll show you! My soul as a merchant predicts we'll be making a fortune!"

"Wonderful! What splendid confidence, Myourmiles-kun! Indeed, if it is you, you will definitely make enough money to satisfy me!"

Having been praised by Rimuru, Myourmiles flustered a bit. Seeing this reaction, Rimuru followed up: "By the way, if you don't mind, how about you come to our nation after finishing hosting the festival? You are ideal for our commercial department, advertisement department or finance department. Regardless, I hope you will become an executive there under whichever sector. As our nation grows bigger, we will need to finalize a set of laws after the festival. If we are able to achieve something great, surely no one will dare to interject, what do you think?"

Rimuru implies with his words that he was convinced the event would be a success, to which Myourmiles was delighted.

*What do you think?* That line was like a divine melody touching Myourmiles's heart as it echoed next to his ears.

He nodded his head firmly.

"---I have truly been defeated. Young Master, no, Rimuru-sama. I, Myourmiles, will assure the success of the plan no matter what so as to become a subject of Rimuru-sama!"

Myourmiles agreed without hesitation. That was only natural.

![break]

*He has so much faith in me. Failure is not an option!*

![break]

After living for so long, Myourmiles was once again feeling the sensation of having trouble sitting still as he felt his body and mind flamed by his excitement, hopes and dreams combined. This sensation was too precious for him to lose.

![break]

"You are being too dramatic, Myourmiles-kun," Rimuru laughed, the two then proceeded to do more detailed planning, during which Myourmiles's excitement showed no signs of dissipating.

*I'll make this festival a success and become Rimuru's trusted subject*---with this new ambition in mind, Myourmiles swore to pledge his life to Rimuru even at the cost of destroying his body and soul.

![break]

By the time Rimuru had left, Myourmiles gathered all his lackeys and servants.

"Myourmiles-sama, what did Rimuru-sama visit you for?" The ex-Rank C adventurer Bydd who was now Myourmiles's personal bodyguard asked. Myourmiles nodded his head dramatically and said: "Bydd, we are going to be busy soon."

"Is he making any forceful request again? That lord's ideas are always interesting, but we always get ordered all over the place. I really wish he put himself in our shoes for once..." Bydd said with a laugh, but he didn't mean it.

Just like Myourmiles, he was also saved by Rimuru and one of the people who were charmed by this demon lord. While he said that he was ordered all over the place, the person looking forward to it more than anyone was none other than Bydd himself.

"Hehe, Bydd. This time is not like that abusive stuff. The ones in the past were but games with petty margins, this time it's gonna be huge, actually, we are betting our future on it."

Cracking a smile, Myourmiles continued.

He was already born with a villain-looking face, it became much more terrifying with a bit of killing intent. Nowadays his subordinates were no longer scared of his face, but they couldn't hide their shock at Myourmiles's words.

"Master, what do you mean by that?" the butler asked in everyone's place; Myourmiles on the other hand briefly summarized the conversation he had with Rimuru for them. He explained that Tempest was holding a kingdom-founding festival, and during which they would be hosting a martial tournament as a recreational event. They would also be testing the waters for the proposed fast food stores. The reason for the Founding Festival was to put on air for the public after Rimuru became a demon lord. Every single member of the Tempest Federation would be contributing to the festival, so naturally its scale would be beyond Myourmiles's imagination.

He excitedly announced to everyone that he had been given a crucial role during such an event. At the end of his speech, he declared: "I've decided to pledge my allegiance to Rimuru-sama. So the proposal this time has to be carried out successfully no matter what!"

His announcement caused his subordinates to gasp. Myourmiles wasn't planning to come back to the Kingdom of Blumund---after learning his resolve, his subordinates looked at each other, all looking confused.

"Hehe, Myourmiles-sama. Surely you are not planning to go alone, right? I may just be a common thug, but I am also a bodyguard. The lackeys under my command also admire Rimuru-sama a lot, so do bring us along!"

"If we are really going there, you alone won't be able to protect me."

"T-that's so mean!"

"---But, if you are willing to help me, it'd be fine to bring you along."

"Of course I will, I am willing to do anything! I may not be very smart, but I've still got some wits in me," Bydd said, given his past as a conman, witty trickeries were up his alley. But this type of speech only baffled Myourmiles, who on the other hand...

"I'm really hopeless against your type. Right, the more the merrier. That includes those thugs, if they don't have a way to make a living, they seem at least capable of being guards. I'll bring them along."

---With that it was decided; Bydd and the rest would be accompanying him. Next, Myourmiles---

"What do the rest of you think? This house is all yours if you like it!" he asked his subordinates. Upon hearing this, they laughed in response.

![break]

" " "Please allow us to accompany you!" " "

![break]

All of these people were personally trained by Myourmiles, they had no attachment to this kingdom and no hesitation. Having made that decision, they were left with tons of work to do. Myourmiles had gained the official recognition of this nation, Blumund, and was part of the Freedom Association. That's why it was his freedom to leave this one for the next.

Myourmiles's motto was "To act as soon as the target is set", but there were things that he had to resolve first. Remembering this, Myourmiles decided to ensure there was no potential trouble left behind. He turned to one of the subordinates who also wished to accompany him and happened to be the head of a small group^[The phrase here to describe his rank is "若頭" (waka-gashira), a common ranking of lieutenant running small group in Japanese yakuza organization.] under him.

"Oi, you should also be able to stand your own ground. Is it fine if I hand this shop to you?"

"M-Master! Why are you bringing this up all of a sudden..."

"It's nothing really. I'm very happy that all of you wish to accompany me. But do consider this yourselves. We don't have any basis of livelihood on Rimuru-sama's side. I hope to plan this thing right and have Rimuru-sama promote me... But I don't want this to affect you all and give you guys a hard time."

These were all courteous words, Myourmiles however had something else in mind. If he abandoned this estate, he would lose his territory that he put so much effort into building in this country. That's why he hoped to leave a few people behind so they could safeguard the base on this land where they could still operate freely. This lieutenant should be more than capable of handling it.

His name was Bach. He was the son of Myourmiles's close acquaintance, who was first sent to his shop in the hope of him learning things. The man was smart enough and Myourmiles appreciated him a lot too, giving him much care. But, the failure of Bach's family business had changed the situation. Since he then became homeless, he was officially hired by Myourmiles, making him a manager in his shop. Nowadays Bach's family all relied on the income he received as manager, Myourmiles couldn't bear to have him fall on hard times like this. That's why he hoped to leave Bach behind. He was almost perfect when it came to handling work. That's why Myourmiles was convinced that it would be fine to hand this shop to him as well.

![break]

"M-Master... I'm truly happy that you want to hand me the shop. But we also want to---"

Perhaps it's because he was young and energetic, Bach couldn't accept it. Perhaps he wished to gain more recognition from Myourmiles and so he couldn't make up his mind to go independent.

Although how Bach was acting was rather pleasing, Myourmiles didn't think this should go on. Bach wouldn't be able to stand on his own if this continued, Myourmiles would have to find a chance to let him go and now was the perfect opportunity.

"Bach, I'm not your parents. I never mentioned giving you this shop, only managing it. Listen now, even with me gone, you cannot allow this shop to go bankrupt, do you understand? And then, in time you will buy this shop from me! First run this shop to prosperity and get your actual parents here one day."

With a gentle smile on his face, Myourmiles put his hand on Bach's shoulder. His words may have sounded kind, but he would make sure to sign the confirmation document and be very clear with the money. Myourmiles was a businessman after all. He was not that naive. With that being said however...

![break]

*If he can't even make enough money to afford purchasing this shop, this boy will not make it big in the future.*

![break]

In another sense, he was also like a strict mentor.

"Thank you, thank you... I will...I will strive for greatness in order to repay Myourmiles-sama's gracious deeds!" Manager Bach expressed his gratitude with tears in his eyes.

These types of words wouldn't get to Myourmiles's heart either way. He nodded deeply after replying: "Good luck then!"

Soon afterwards, Myourmiles finished all of the procedures. After selecting who to bring and who should stay, he gave some final advice to Lieutenant Bach.

"In case of any trouble, just come and discuss things with me. I have faith that you guys will be successful in running things right. You better not let me down!"

Bach and the rest who were staying at the estate nodded after hearing this. Myourmiles was thorough with his teaching, so no one would dare to be reckless. They wouldn't go so far as to do something rude even against noblemen.

"Myourmiles-sama, everyone here was trained from start to finish by you. Please be reassured!"

Myourmiles nodded after hearing Bach's guarantee.

"Heh, you sure talk the talk. But there's something you guys should know---"

"Please be reassured. We will handle the trade route built by Myourmiles-sama on this land with caution. We will prioritize reaching any of your demands first."

"Hmm. I'll be counting on you!"

Just in case, Myourmiles had made the deal beforehand that if there was ever any emergency use, they would focus on getting rid of (selling) their own merchandise first. He wouldn't get careless in that regard.

And Bach wasn't hesitating either, his thoughts aligned with Myourmiles's without a word and he quickly came to realize it.

![break]

*He's still lacking something for now, but I can tell from his eyes, Bach is already starting to be his own man... Then I can hand it to him with reassurance*---Myourmiles thought to himself.

![break]

And like that, Myourmiles had finished managing everything. With a group of followers, he set off for Tempest Federation.

![hard scene break]

I sighed with relief after leaving Myourmiles's estate.

![break]

*Wonderful, now he has finally taken the task. There should be a lot to look forward to, now that he has made a direct response to my invitation.*

![break]

Our nation didn't have any monster who was good at managing money. Up until now Shuna had been in charge of accounting, but this probably couldn't continue. Right now she could still handle it at village-level, but if it rose to national-level, even Shuna would have to surrender. Lilina from the management department and Vesta who was a minister in the Dwarven Kingdom were there to assist her, but it was undeniable that there remained an inadequacy of talent. It would also be impossible for me to do it since it was too troublesome.

It was then that I recalled Myourmiles-kun. This man was a master of finance even in the human society. He had traded with a bunch of nobles in addition to a few different kingdoms. It was quite the waste to have someone like him be a mere merchant, that's why I thought he would definitely be of use in my nation. And most importantly, Myourmiles-kun knew how to be flexible. If I had him in charge of finance, I could ask him to spare more pocket money for me. I'd collaborated with Myourmiles in the past as well making money in secret, so I looked forward to grabbing tons of cash in bigger actions.

![break]

*Just kidding, there's plenty of that in our nation's treasury! But all the money has been taken by me and not distributed as salary to my subordinates. This makes me feel...sort of guilty and stuff...*^[Cue side story "Payday in Tempest" in volume 13.5]

![break]

*All of this belongs to Rimuru-sama*---everyone said, so I was even more afraid to take anything. I would definitely feel bad afterwards. All in all, I thought that money should be spent on national development. However, we still needed money. Not that I was personally interested, but because I had to bring that brat Gobta to the Night Butterfly again. Veldora was also arguing that he wanted to come along, which was super annoying. Visiting that type of store would cost some money one way or another.

![break]

I was (definitely) not personally interested, but Gobta and Veldora were really giving me headaches. This amount was nothing compared to the national treasury, but if it were just my pocket money, the expense would be so ridiculous that I'd be spending it all in one place. Moreover, Shuna always got my pocket money for me, but as soon as she heard the location I had visited she would confiscate my wallet immediately... Under those circumstances, how could I even dare to ask, "Isn't the money from the treasury my money anyway?"

![break]

That's why I was working on side-projects to earn pocket money so that there would be no such concern in the future. I even ended up with the intriguing plan to host a martial tournament. Myourmiles-kun truly had an outstanding talent. I had no idea how he interpreted my words, but his enthusiasm for planning exceeded my imagination.

Attracting crowds by hosting a martial tournament was his idea, and he also quickly came up with the plan to introduce merchandise as well as selling healing potions and equipment. He was indeed a visionary. These were amazing pitches.

After I returned, I needed to tell everyone to construct a colosseum fast. While Geld was helping the Beast Kingdom rebuild their city, Mildo would need to assist him as well. With the two persons in charge of the construction department abroad, I had practically become the one in charge.

But that's totally fine. It was probably due to the continuous construction projects that our nation had gradually given birth to new engineering talents. That's why nowadays all I needed to do was ask, without any need to do heavy work. There was a craftsman^[The term is 職人, which means craftsman/worker, in this case the role is similar to "engineer"] called of Gobkyu, who was Mildo's disciple. Now he had become a pillar of the town's construction industry. If it were him, surely, he would be able to build a gorgeous-looking colosseum.

![break]

Under normal circumstances, such a project would take up to a dozen years, but with the strength of monsters, the time can be reduced tremendously. With that being said, the time left before the festival was just barely more than two months. The remaining time available was insufficient, it would be impossible to complete all of the buildings. So we should just lay out the stages this time.

As for the design---

![break]

<<Answer. Have extracted master's memory of Colosseum ruins from ancient Roman period. Construction of blueprint based on this information... Successful.>>

![break]

---Just like that, easy peasy.

There was still some paper left, so I started to sketch and add up my ideas on it. Normally speaking, it would take at least a couple of months to reach this level of design. Field measurement, calculation of construction intensity etc. What made it worse was that the time taken for these operations alone would be using the base unit of year, which would be more than common.^[Fuse works in the construction business, probably speaking from experience.] In addition, the design graph of it was supposed to be sketched in a computer for a few days, but now all I needed to do was draw it out by hand... The support of Wisdom King Raphael-sensei on such details had also been boosted in efficiency. Although I still felt that this was somewhat beyond common sense---that is but my belated comment, I should have more of an open mind.

![break]

Next, the design graph was done all right, but I still needed to discuss with Gobkyu. Before that, now that I was in the Kingdom of Blumund, I wanted to drop by the Freedom Association.

I should first hand the design graph to Gobkyu. When he has spare time, he can gather and lead the workers to the construction site.

Then, let's deliver the message.

"Ranga, are you there?"

"Yes, my master!"

I summoned Ranga. He stuck his head out from my shadow and responded.

Since the plan to conquer the Kingdom of Farmus had been settled for a while, everyone except Diablo had returned. But Ranga seemed to have taken my shadow as his designated personal seat and immediately went into it.

I handed the sketched design graph of the colosseum to Ranga.

"Hand this to a craftsman in the town by the name of Gobkyu. By the way, could you help me by asking whether they have time to gather at the west gate?"

"Understood. Speaking of which, isn't Rimuru-sama returning as well?"

"No. Since I've come all the way here, I want to visit Fuze first before returning."

"If that's the case, shouldn't you need a bodyguard to accompany you?"

Knowing that I was not returning yet, Ranga seemed quite anxious. I saw that his tail was hanging low, but you need not worry that much. Despite how I look, I'm still a demon lord after all. At the moment I wasn't getting careless and had 'Absolute Defense' running. If I actually ran into an attack strong enough to break it, wouldn't it be unsafe for me wherever I go? What Ranga was doing is called being paranoid.

![break]

"There's not gonna be any problem. I'll just be going to have a little chat with him. If anyone should warrant any worries, it would be Myourmiles. He seems to have become a target of some strange nobleman. There's no way of knowing what that type of person would do."

"Oh, are you referring to that vulgar man from before? Should I go and bite him to death?"

STOPUUU. *Don't do that kind of thing in towns of other kingdoms. It's gonna cause huge problems.*

"Geez, you must have gotten so aggressive because of spending all that time with Shion. I think you'd better relearn some normal values."

"H-How so!"

Ranga was shocked at my comment. He wasn't self-aware at all.

"During your last battle, did you really adhere to my orders? Have you really not overdone things?"

"T-There's no such thing, master---"

Ranga seemed kind of shaken, could it be...

The only things reported back by Gobta and Gabil was as follows---"N-No problem at all!", "R-Right. We were lucky to have Ranga-san there, he was really reliable!"

I felt something was suspicious but did not ask for details. I had a feeling that it would've just given me a headache if I had asked. Therefore, I left those matters for Diablo to take care of and, since that guy hasn't complained about anything, I'll just pretend everything was fine. ~~(Grigori: It was not okay)~~

This is what people call running away from problems. But, if there really was any problem, someone should have already reported to me, so I just chose to believe them. I hoped Ranga could be more cautious in the future to stay away from getting poisoned by Shion('s mind).

"Ranga-kun? Do it as a favor for me, please don't act too reckless!"

I caressed Ranga's neck and gave him those words of caution.

"I understand---"

Ranga nodded obediently in response, concluding this ordeal.

"All right. Next, I hope you can deliver the message. One more thing, by the way, if there are any people available from the security department, send them to protect Myourmiles. Please confirm the matter for me as well!"

"Understood!"

With that being said, Ranga once again snuck into my shadow and set on his way to return home.

![soft scene break]

I decided at last to send a guard to Myourmiles's side. They would be protecting him from the shadows without being noticed. Although I wasn't sure who they would send, but there were very few individuals in the security department who could operate on their own. It's safe to say it wouldn't be any rookie, the person coming would at least be a seasoned veteran at the rank of squad leader.

The squad leader is the team leader of a five-man squad. In terms of ranking for adventurers that equates to Rank B, tasking them as a bodyguard should not pose any challenge. During my stay in this town, I needed to get hold of Myourmiles's trace so that I would be informed if he encountered any dicey situations. Before the guard arrived, I went to go see Fuze first.

![break]

I opened the gate to the building of the Freedom Association branch in Blumund and entered. I accidentally went overboard last time, which made me concerned about whether I would cause a commotion... But only a sight of "Who are you?" greeted me. Since the person didn't say anything, I successfully made my way to the counter.

Oh right, I came in last time with that mask, so there was no way they would know who I was.

Never mind, this is fine. If they weren't willing to help me contact Fuze, I'd just drop the invitation and leave. With that relaxed outlook on my mind, I walked towards the counter.

"Heyo. My name is Rimuru. Could you help slide a message for the branch leader Fuze-san? Ah, take this, it's my identity card."

As I finished, I took out my identification card from my 'Stomach' and showed the reception lady.

*How is such a young girl an adventurer?* Usually I didn't mind hearing this. All I felt was "~~Ah shit,~~ here we go again".

I'd long gotten used to it by now, but luckily the reception lady still remembered me. She blushed and gazed at me mesmerized.

"Ah, you must be Rimuru-san! Long time no see! How have you been?"

"Hmm? I'm doing fine, very lively! I see you are doing fine as well, how wonderful---"

"Yes! I've been doing fine too. By the way, Rimuru-san, I heard that you've passed the test at HQ and even ranked up to B-plus. Impressive, I truly admire you!"

"Ah, right. I wanted to go through the Rank A test, but I've been busy lately."

![break]

Actually, I just felt it was too troublesome. Since I'd already ranked up above Rank B, my access increased with it, and with it came more responsibility. I already felt there to be too much trouble at B-plus, but I'd go for a higher rank when there was the need.

I wasn't doing it for the salary anyway, yet I still had to move out when crisis emerges. But in return, I got to access all the nations conveniently and I also didn't need to pay resting and dining at different branches. To be honest, it was indeed delightful to have so much convenience covered in so many areas, but it would be really troublesome to have restraints put on me by others. But I didn't need to say such a thing to shatter everyone's dream.

![break]

"If it is Rimuru-san, surely you will make it! I'll be cheering for you!"

"Ah, is it now? Thanks a lot, hahahahahaha..."

It was also very troublesome when she was gazing at me with those shining anime eyes---yet upon thinking so, the reception lady immediately dropped the shocker.

"By the way, Rimuru-san, won't you be very troubled that you have the same name as the demon lord? There's something called 'Rename System' that if you are truly troubled by it, you can re-register your name at the association. If you visit a location where no one knows you, you would be able to operate with the disguise of a lower-level rookie, what do you think?"

I-I totally forgot! I'd become a demon lord, and was using my name directly in public...

Nowadays, the name of the member of the Octagram Rimuru Tempest the "New Star (Newbie)" was known by the world, wouldn't it pose a problem to be an adventurer with the self-proclaimed name of Rimuru?

I should just stay away from the adventurer career. I'll wait until whenever I am forced to move out as an adventurer to use my "Rename System". It seemed that for me I could move out when lowered to Rank B, that should be enough. By the way, I never knew there was such a convenient system.

![break]

"Thanks. I've picked up a good bit of advice today. I'll have to trouble you if I need that. Anyway, are you able to reach Fuze-san?"

"Ah, yes. Please come by and register by that time! Then, I shall lead the way for you."

With all the other topics cleared, she immediately let me go. Seeing that someone was personally guiding me, commotion began to spread behind my back.

"Is this serious?"

"Who is that young girl!"

There were some conversations mixed in the voices, the one talking seemed to have witnessed my prowess in battle last time.

"Eh, you gotta be kidding! That fellow turns out to be such an adorable little girl?"

"Unbelievable... So that's what the Rimuru-dono who defeated the lesser demon with ease looks like..."

"I heard he shares the same name as the demon lord."

"Could this be the real deal---"

"Ya idiot, how could that be possible!"

"I guess you have a point, ahahahaha!"

Something along those lines. It seemed more and more people were spreading rumors about me, though there was nothing to worry about, it was all within what I expected. We only shared the same name; it was fortunate that no one appeared to realize that I was the actual demon lord.

Perhaps the name "Rimuru" wasn't that rare after all. ~~(Veldora: Am I a joke to you? Everyone: Yes!)~~ As I thought so, I walked towards the room Fuze was waiting in.

![break]

I entered the room casually. Upon seeing me, Fuze was holding his head. I didn't give much thought to it and greeted Fuze.

"Heya! I've come to play. What's wrong with you, did something happen? What's that distressed look on your face?"

"Uh... Everything was so peaceful up until just now, but a demon lord suddenly showed up..."

"Eh? Really? That would be terrible. Aren't you being too casual?"

"No no no, that demon lord is right in front of me. Now then, what should I do...?"

"Eh, is that so? Hmm, I suppose you should serve him a cup of tea? And if there is any cake or food like that around, I think the demon lord would be pretty pleased to eat them too!"

"What cake! Do you think it is that easy to get luxurious food like that! Seriously, why does Rimuru-san, even after becoming a demon lord, enjoy coming and going wherever you please?"

While complaining, Fuze didn't forget to prepare tea for me. You can't judge a book by its cover, he was a serious man.

I said my thanks as I took that cup of tea. With a sip down my throat, we began to discuss business.

![break]

"Rimuru-san, I'm really sorry this time. We weren't able to successfully stop the Western Holy Church which led to the march of the Holy Knight Order..."

"Ah, that really couldn't be helped. The masterminds seemed to have been the 'Seven Luminary Clerics'."

"Really?"

"So no matter how hard we have emphasized that the people of my nation are harmless, they would probably not listen."

"It's the 'Seven Celestial'...? Those people were the guardians of mankind, they were great heroes in the past---"

"So I heard. They had Hinata in their sights too, so after a series of incidents, she is luckily still safe and sound and our misunderstanding was resolved along with it. But unfortunately, there was one casualty. One of the captains called Garde went missing."

"Garde of 'Fire'---Although he was not as good as Shizue-san, he was still talented in launching elegant spear moves combined with the magic of fire spirits. That man was one of the Ten Great Saints who are the protectors of mankind..." Fuze muttered regretfully.

The Garde I saw was an illusion created as a disguise by the Seven Luminaries, so I wasn't able to meet him in person and had no idea what type of person he really was. But since he appeared to be quite famous, Fuze would naturally know given how well-informed he always was.

While I said that he had gone missing, I suspected he had probably been murdered. I felt really sorry for Garde-san, but all I could say now was "rest in peace..."

![break]

I then recounted the events up until today. Just now Fuze had been worried about me, so I also told him about the Walpurgis Banquet. I mentioned that the demon lords had been reduced to eight people and their name changed to "Octagram". I also told him about my conflict with Hinata and how the Seven Luminaries died. Mindful of my promise, I vaguely brushed over the part about Luminas's true identity. Although people may say that my lips were never sealed tightly enough, I was not thick-headed enough to have revealed such an important secret.

"I see how it was... No matter how we had approached or tried to contact them, it would have all been obstructed on the outset. I even sent people to the Church headquarters after communication with the Western Holy Church branch failed. But I couldn't get in contact with anyone higher than the rank of priest... I never imagined that the Seven Luminaries would have been plotting behind the scene."

"Hinata said so too. But, their faith towards Ru---correction, the God Luminas was true, that seemed to have also been confirmed by Hinata."

"Humans are too fragile, that's why we want to rely on the power of god---"

"Does Fuze do that too?"

"Haha, I'm not like them. When I run out of my last breath, it would be the end of me. I've lived all my life with that resolved in mind. Although I do pray for miracles, I do not pray to any 'God' that I've never met."

I see, so Fuze was an atheist. In this world, monsters with supernatural strength were often worshipped as earth deities to be respected by man. But they would only do so after meeting said beings. It was no exception for Luminas: in the beginning she seemed only interested in protecting individuals that she had known well. Fuze had never met such a god before, that's why he relied on his own strength. It may sound very pragmatic, but it was easy to understand.

"I can indeed understand how people feel the need to pray to god. But in reality, what god is capable of doing is probably only within their own abilities. To put aside God Luminas, it is sufficient to say that the incident has brought us and the Western Holy Church together in peace."

It was precisely because I knew the true identity of the God Luminas that I knew praying was a meaningless action. But at the end of the day, it is but empty talk. Sometimes prayer alone would bring people strength, it is not something I could just simply rebuke.

"That's right. I personally feel as if a huge burden has been taken off my shoulders."

Fuze smiled as he finished. He seemed to be quite troubled by achieving pitifully little while struggling to persuade the Western Holy Church in accordance with our deal. Seeing how much he cared sparked joy within me.

I'd talked from start to finish about all of the events as we chatted. I rose up as I brought the conversation to a close, but suddenly recalled something.

"Then it is about time for me to leave, here's something for you."

I took out an envelope from my pocket and handed it to Fuze. The envelope contained the invitation for the Kingdom-Founding Festival that was planned to be hosted in my nation. I almost forgot about it during the intense exchange. This was my purpose of visiting today after all.

"And this is?"

"We are hosting a celebration for the presentation announcing my inauguration as demon lord. Being titled a Founding Festival, we plan to have some fun. I've also sent out invitations to the royalties and noble in the neighboring nations, Fuze, you've got to attend it as well."

"Huh? Hold on, Rimuru-san. Even if I attend---"

"It's all right. We have an invitation for the king of Blumund as well, so help me deliver it along the way."

"Why don't you just directly---Ah, is it not convenient..."

"Indeed. I have people directly sending the invitations to the Dwarven King and Duke Elalude's side, but I'm not familiar with the people in other nations. A monster running directly towards them may cause a commotion, so I've had people send them to the Freedom Association branches in their respective kingdoms. I did meet the king of Blumund once, but is it really okay for a demon lord to go there in person?" I said with a smile, Fuze grasped the invitation with a wry smile, "Things are already bad enough when a demon lord comes here."

"I've now indeed got the invitation. I'll make sure to hand it over to the king," Fuze changed his expression and made his promise.

Now that my business was done, I did plan to leave for real now, but this time I was interrupted by Fuze suddenly speaking up upon recalling something, "By the way, the head of Freedom Association has been worried about Rimuru-san as well. He was drained during the negotiation with the Western Holy Church, I'll inform him later that the problem has been successfully resolved."

So Yuuki had been worried about me. A lot had happened since I last met that guy. I got a nostalgic feeling.

"I see, it seems I've given Yuuki some unnecessary trouble."

"It's not unnecessary. Honestly, the Association doesn't wish to antagonize the Western Holy Church, so he judged that it would be most ideal to find a way to peacefully negotiate."

Fuze told me not to worry. But I kinda wanted to give something to Yuuki in return---

"Speaking of! Let me invite Yuuki along. Or would it cause some problems?"

"About that, I'm not exactly sure. Although I'm not qualified to say so, he is still quite the busy man. I'm not sure if he can find the spare hours..."

"I'll cover his transportation for coming and leaving, is it possible for him to have one day off? If he can't then I won't push it, I'll just go play with him later. That's all, please help me deliver this to him as well."

As I finished, I started to write a letter in front of Fuze and put it into the envelope along with the invitation. I handed it over to the shocked Fuze.

"Rimuru-san, where did that paper come from... Uh, never mind. Besides, if it's only a letter I can do the favor utilizing the magic of 'Teleportation'..."

Fuze seemed exhausted. I may be a little bit too casual with asking people for favors.

"Ahaha, sorry. Then, I'll be counting on you."

"I understand, Rimuru-san."

"Ah, just one more thing, Milim is coming to the Founding Festival too."

As I confirmed Fuze had taken the envelope, I delivered such an astonishing statement.

"Milim? Ehh, do you mean..."

"I'll be leaving first then, that's just how it is!"

I smiled widely as I bid him farewell to quickly flee the scene.

"Hold on! Is that supposed to be THE Demon Lord Milim??? EH, OIII!"

Some tormented voice seemed to be projecting in my direction, but I'll just pretend I heard nothing.

![soft scene break]

After leaving the location of the association branch, a man jumped out of my shadow to greet me while kneeling.

"My name is Gobemon, I've come to answer to my liege Rimuru's summon."

The man called himself Gobemon and was one of the hobgoblins that I named. He was quite ambitious, I recalled hearing news about him fighting with Gobta over the seat of vice-captain back when Rigur was still captain. Naturally, his strength was guaranteed...

"Eh, didn't you become a centurion? And didn't you move to another corps because Gobta became the captain of the goblin riders?"

If he was able to become a centurion, it meant he was more than capable of being a commander. No squadmate has been given the title^[Not exactly sure what this is referring to, source: 隊員がいなくて与えられゐのだが], and he doesn't actually have a hundred-men as subordinates^[Based on the term "Centurian" which has both the literate kanji meaning of "Hundred-men Leader" and its roman origin being the commander of a squad around a hundred men.]. But of course, it is a higher position than squad leader, compared to a squad leader who can lead five to ten men, the strength of a centurion is far beyond that.

"Yes. Honestly, I don't want to work under anyone. Right now, I'm trying to work on my own. I want to recruit direct subordinates that only answer to me and build my own troops."

*Oh oh.*

This guy's got some bone in him. Good, because he didn't want to work under Gobta, that's why he was not interested in the position of vice-captain of the popular Goblin Riders, so having such ambition was as expected.

"I see, then I hope you can learn well. Myourmiles-kun is someone I really rely on, so please protect him vigorously and avoid being noticed. In addition, his way of manipulating people's hearts is worthy of studying. Even though most people work for him due to the temptation of profits, that is definitely not the only factor. You can learn from him while protecting him."

"Yes! I'll keep my liege Rimuru's words in mind and carry out my duty with dedication!"

Gobemon was fully motivated.

According to Benimaru's observation, Gobemon tended towards being too confident in his abilities and often looked down on the flawed traits of his subordinates and companions. That was also the reason why, despite his constitution and other results being superior to Gobta, he didn't make the part of the captain. If this mission could teach him to care about his subordinates, it would be fine to hand the whole corps to him. Therefore, I hoped he would undergo some growth through it.

"If you complete this mission well and learn something along the way, report back to me then. As your reward, I'll gift you this dachi (sword) that I'm using right here."

Kurobee had informed me that my special sword had been crafted. Which means, I'd be bidding farewell to this dachi. At first, I only had someone make it as a replacement, nowadays its quality had become incredible after being intensely submerged in my youki. I had it repaired once after the battle against Hinata, even Kurobee was shocked by it then. It would be pretty appropriate to make it a reward.

"R-Really?"

Gobemon was flattered, his eyes opened wide, bursting with excitement.

"That's right. Considering your abilities, you should be able to wield this sword. But you must work harder to get my approval!"

"Yes sir! I, Gobemon, will meet my liege Rimuru's expectations!"

Departing with these words, Gobemon ran off to guard Myourmiles. I intentionally dangled the reward before his eyes to lure him into doing my deeds; I wondered if Gobemon got the message or not.

Winning a subordinate's trust isn't a trivial matter. Just like the concept known since ancient times---the Feudal system, if there wasn't any mutual benefit, the relationship between the ruler and his subjects would inevitably fracture. Speaking of this, I was concerned about getting better myself, so I really shouldn't be seen as a role model. I hoped Gobemon would prove himself in his own way and meet my expectations.

![break]

All right, now all the invitations had been sent. Next, all we needed to do was to ensure our preparations wrapped up before the festival. I hope we can host a grand festival.

With my mood flying high, I outlined the necessary matters in my head.
