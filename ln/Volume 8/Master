**Translator's Note**

Volume 8 is finally done, kept you waiting huh?

![break]

There're not many major note-worthy things in this volume, most of such will be annotated in the book. These include lines and phrases I'm not entirely sure of or explanation of phrase/term origin etc.

I've tried to proofread the volume as much as possible with the JP source this time, though it would be good to have a JP proofreader separately. Again, special thanks to Mimisan for his contribution in Volume 7 and 8 with the Japanese proofread.

There's one particular issue however I wish to address at the front, that is the issue with websites sharing our work. Since our work is totally free and available to anyone online, obviously there will be websites sharing our work, if you are not using them for any commercial means, we appreciate the sharing. However, I've come to notice some websites have published our work with edits of their own, whether it is a watermark of their own, changing the paragraph format or in some worse cases removing annotations.

There's really not much we can do to address this, but to whom it may concern, please do not downgrade the readers' experience by removing texts that are meant for clarification. If you somehow are able to convert the epub file back to word doc to edit our translation, do the readers a favour and either compile the footnotes into a different section or just leave them as they are... If you really would like to edit our work in some particular fashion, we strongly encourage you to reach out to us through either email or discord. And once again, I'll reiterate, any of our work should not be used in commercial means or ways that encourage commercial gain for an individual or group. Just putting this in the front for the you-know-who people to see...

By the way, this note will not appear in our Slime Reader^TM^. What? You've never heard of [Slime Reader^TM^](https://tensurafan.github.io/)? Pfft, you know it's fun right? You can read all of our work online or on your phone with footnotes embedded. You can even select the translated phrase of your preference including names and terminologies to read the entire volume with, read it and you can tell me if "Lord of Wisdom Raphael" sounds better than "Wisdom King Raphael" or not ~~(it doesn't)~~. Not convinced yet? I'll cut you a deal then, it's available online for free, and that's a great price. Visit our [blog](https://tensurafan.home.blog/) to get a [bonus tutorial](https://tensurafan.home.blog/2019/06/26/slime-reader-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/) and extra uwu from its creator muggy.
