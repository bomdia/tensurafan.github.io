# Chapter 4: The Blue|Demon's|Monologue

Nice to meet you all, my name is Raine.
Huh? Don't know me? Come on, cut the crap, or do I need to slap some sense into you? Go back to school and study again!

.........

......

...

Whoops, sorry. I guess I just snapped a little. I'm usually a ladylike person, but I do go wild sometimes. I mean *sometimes*. Anyway, since you don't know me, I guess I should introduce myself to you. Like I said before, my name is Raine. I'm a servant---no, a faithful maid of the Demon Lord Guy Crimson-sama.

I've known Guy-sama for a long, long time, even before the creation of heaven and earth maybe? How long ago was that? Who knows? I mean, do you even remember exactly the time you were born? No? That's it. These mundane questions are a pain in the ass, just ignore them. Back to the topic. I am invincible because I was derived from the Great Spirit of Darkness...or so I thought. I'm not going to deny I got a little carried away because of that.
I made a huge mistake. I teamed up with a like-minded person and attacked whoever looked stronger than I was. Looking back now, I was such a dumbass. That one bastard was too strong. I thought I could beat him two-on-one, but he just wiped the floor with both of us. That guy who beat us was Rogue, the Red Primordial a.k.a. Demon Lord Guy Crimson-sama.
By the way, it was Vert, the Green Primordial or Mizeri, who challenged Guy-sama with me. We are very good friends. My job is Mizeri's and Mizeri's salary is mine.

"Raine! Stop slacking and get your cleaning done!"

Tsk. I was introducing you to her but she's being an annoying bitch.

"What did you say?"

"N-no, nothing."

"No? You better not."

Phew, that was a close one. Mizeri is very perceptive. She always catches me slacking off and it's difficult to pull one over on her. I'll just keep on cleaning before she gets mad at me.

![break]

So, yeah, I still haven't finished my introduction. Mizeri and I lost to Guy-sama, but this revealed one important fact. A demon will be extinguished when its heart core is shattered. However, we, the Primordials, can recover from any condition!

I heard that the True Dragons inherit memories while losing their personalities upon death, but in our case, our personalities remained intact. Guy-sama's partner, Frost Dragon Velzard-sama, used to re-educate her younger brother by resetting his personality, but that doesn't apply to us Primordials. Seriously, isn't that amazing?

I would love to brag about it, but unfortunately there are some drawbacks. First, it takes a long time to recover, but you know, that's the least of the problems. What's important is the other one. Immortality is nice and all, but among demons, the loser must become subservient. In our cases, that was to Guy-sama. This revelation had thrown a wrench into the balance of power among the demons, creating a distorted equilibrium.

Is it because of our fault or our help? It's hard to say. What was that? Mizeri's opinion was the former, and mine was the latter, huh? You knew that? You...you're not prejudiced against me, are you? Stop looking at *me* like I'm a problem child. Well, that's beside the point. I'll tell you some secret information about demons, or rather, how to kill one.

![break]

The Primordials cannot be destroyed, but they can be made subservient. However, since that is not as enforceable as servitude, it is not quite an absolute obedience. We can also disobey Guy-sama if we want to. I don't, though, and to a certain extent, he has the power to force us to do so. It's a hassle to go against it.

Moving on to the Primordials' direct descendants. Normally, except for that idiot Noir the Black Primordial, Primordials spawn many dependents. They are useful as maidservants because they obey every order from their superiors of the same color. Well, "spawning" may not be the most accurate term here. It's too complicated to explain in detail, so I'll give you a quick explanation.

A newborn lesser demon is colorless. It has knowledge but no ego, and it is weak. Most of them are typically summoned by humans, and are called "servant types." When these demons have their egos developed, they're called "autonomous types". When one evolves into a greater demon, it is characterized by its nature and personality, and the color of its lineage can be easily identified.

Sometimes, the higher-ups would scout them out and bring them to their factions. In fact, this is probably the usual way to do it. Mizeri, for example, is diligent and very good at managing her own faction. They've even infiltrated human society and run several groups, such as the Apostles of Verte.

Me? Nah, I'm good. I'll pass on that hassle. What? I'm just like Black? Hey! Stop messing around. Are you kidding me?! I have my own faction! Black pisses me off, so don't ever think anything stupid again! Dammit.

Back to the topic at hand, most newborn demons don't have factions, but by the time they evolve into greater demons, they're color-coded and assigned to a faction. Some of them are born with colors, but those usually are reincarnated demons.

Since demons are immortal, they will reincarnate after they die. Demons are stubborn and can resurrect even with their souls shattered, especially the close associates of the original colors. Even so, these dependents will disappear if their heart cores are shattered. So, if you're lucky enough to beat one, you'd have to crush the core if you want it *gone*.

As a side note, you don't need to be as careful with those weak-willed, newborn "servant types." Those are small fry that only have knowledge of battle but no experience. So, they might "die" just by destroying the body. Well, don't worry about that.

![break]

Well, that was our secret. Since we figured this out, at least we can get something out of our defeat. If anything, I'd say we did a good job there.

![hard scene break]

So we served Guy-sama out of altruism, and that's a lot more fun than it seemed. Guy-sama has apparently decided to leave the struggle for supremacy in the underworld and work on earth. Guy-sama is ostensibly a very disciplined person, so we were with him.

"You can do whatever you want with your life, too," he said, but I don't care about that. I want to be on the winning side all the time. Since Guy-sama can't be defeated, I think the position I'm in is the best. Well, if Guy-sama ever loses, then that would be interesting.

"No. My mission is to be of service to you." That's what I said at that time. What do you think? It's almost like a perfect maid, don't you think? You won't find a maid as loyal as me anywhere else---at least I thought so...

"That's right. You are the king. We are your subjects. That is the eternal and immortal truth."

Mizeri...you acted so well! No, she's probably being honest here. This is bad. I guess this rival of mine is not so easy to deal with after all. While I've been living my life with a selfish sense of rivalry, Mizeri seemed to trust me, so I had to stop showing her things. Oh well, what can I do? And so continued the rotten relationship between Mizeri and I.

![break]

We wandered from place to place and settled in our current base. It's the most frigid place a creature could ever live in, but I'm a demon, so I don't mind---no, I do. When I was trying to wash the clothes, they just froze over. Then I got angry and poked at them just a bit and they just shattered to pieces! That just pissed me off.

Well, I'm fine, despite those failures.

"You ought to be more careful about what you do!"

"Raine, I think you should be a little concerned about that, don't you?"

Guy-sama warned me about this, so I started to care a little bit. That's where the servants came in. I have them do their best to make it easy on me! So, I haven't failed once since then.

I have grown up, too. And so, our job is no longer only washing clothes. We are so good that we are rumored to be the all-purpose maids in town. We also do cooking, singing, dancing, playing musical instruments, and fine arts to meet Guy-sama's needs. Well, there may have been some failures in cooking and laundry. But we all learn from our mistakes, just like other demons do. So let's put the past where it belongs.

![break]

My specialty, frankly, is painting. I love abstract painting. I painted Mizeri as a model the other day and she was moved to tears.

"I was furious."

"Then it was a great success!"

"You're such a..."

Mizeri was exasperated, but I didn't care. Her rage means that her emotions were in turmoil. That's a big deal to a demon, a spiritual life form. I was scared of my talent. Needless to say, when I paint Guy-sama or Velzard-sama, I have to choose a concrete painting. It's always a big hit because they're so perfect.

"I knew it. You really can draw if you put your mind to it. That's why I'm even more annoyed..." Mizeri mumbled something, but as always, I'll just let it slide.

![break]

By the way, let me tell you about one of my hobbies. The extreme cold is so harsh and inhospitable, there's literally a snowstorm outside. With such an all-white backdrop, the inside of the 'Barrier' is in everlasting summer mode. We even changed the terrain to create a lake and a white sandy beach. I would then put chairs on the beach, lie down, and let the dependents serve me food and drinks. It was the best kind of entertainment.

I wonder how much energy is spent on my hobby. I can't stop smiling just thinking about it. This is also very popular with Guy-sama.

"Raine is the best when it's about getting people to think about these things."

"I admit it. I knew you were great, Raine."

Ufufu, Mizeri also gave me a compliment. At this rate, I think I will continue to put my hobby to good use at work!

![hard scene break]

Oh yeah, I have an important job, not to forget. Occasionally, I am a guide for the Walpurgis---the banquet of the demon lords. What is it, you ask? In the early days, as the name suggests, the three demon lords got together to enjoy a meal. Guy-sama and Milim-sama, oh and also Ramiris-sama.

Milim-sama is the niece of Velzard-sama and her power is immense. There was a time when she lost control and went on a rampage, and it was beyond description. We could have joined the battle because we would not die, but doing so would have destroyed the planet itself, so in the end, Velzard-sama, Mizeri and I were tasked with containing the aftermath of the battle.

We're not going to do it again. If Ramiris-sama hadn't helped us, we would have fallen before the battle was over. So that's why we love Ramiris-sama as well as Guy-sama. Of course, we respect Milim-sama, so we are very excited to have all three of them together.

![break]

The definition of "Walpurgis" has changed over the years. The number of demon lords is on the rise. Guy-sama's job was to keep mankind from dying out, but he's been recruiting more people to help him do it.

The first person to become the fourth demon lord was Dagruel-sama. Actually, he was the one who suffered the most when Guy-sama and Milim-sama fought. He also helped us prevent the earth from being affected. Even so, Dagruel-sama's dominion has turned into a barren land...well, that doesn't matter, not my problem. He's managed to live with magic, but it didn't stop the desert from expanding. It's all settled now, but it seems to have been harder back then. I just said good luck and cheered from afar.

The next demon lord was Luminas-sama, the "Queen of Nightmares." She is the only daughter of the vampire ancestor, and is very strong, but I think we should start speaking of the ancestor itself.

![break]

It was supposed to be the ancestor of the divine humans created by Veldanava-sama. Veldanava-sama sought a wise being to speak to him. With the birth of angels and demons, his need was satisfied. That's why he tried to bring civilization to earth, and it seems that the ancestor was expected to play that role.

Well, that was a failure. Maybe because it was immortal and didn't need to produce any offspring. Maybe like us demons, the ancestors didn't have a gender. So it seems it had to wait for tens of thousands of years or more for a race to be born that could thrive on earth. I heard it all before, but the ancestor didn't give up.

It kept running these forbidden experiments to fulfill Veldanava-sama's expectations. That bastard loved experiments more than the prosperity of its descendants. Whether that was a good thing or a bad thing is difficult for me to say, but I can tell you this---it was an annoying asshole! I don't know how many times the human race nearly went extinct because of that idiot's experiments!

However, it's also true that because of that idiot's experiments, true human beings, the high humans, were born. Although the eternal divine humans could not be created, it contributed to the birth of mankind.

You don't believe that, do you? That's right, I didn't see it with my own eyes, so I don't believe it either. I heard that the ancestor created two races by analyzing its own body. They were the high humans and the vampires. It's not the way they were supposed to be born, but it's just as well they were born. By the time Guy-sama was summoned to earth, the human race had already spread all over the place. The high humans built a huge nation, larger than the human beings today.

However, it seems that both races had their strengths and weaknesses. Although the high humans inherited strong magical power, their spirits had problems. As you can see from the stupidity of summoning Guy-sama, they thought that they were the best of the best. There's a saying in other worlds that "Those who are arrogant have not been around long enough" and that's exactly what happened. They were destroyed in the blink of an eye.

And as for the vampires, they had their own problems. Perhaps that's a good thing, because they're still around until this day. Possessing a strong body and powerful magic, high immortality, and a mature mind, it's a good thing they had all these things, but they were always vulnerable to being out in the sun. They couldn't truly be the supreme rulers of the earth.

That ancestor asshole continued to experiment. Well, I was there at the time, so I can generally remember what it was doing. At that time, spirits from the Great Spirit of each attribute had already split off and filled the earth with the four major elements. Those spirits took in magical elements and materialized, rather, incarnated. In other words, it was the ancestor who helped those spirits materialize.

From the "earth" attribute, the earth spirits, High Dwarves, were born.
From the "water" attribute, the water spirits, Sirens, were born.
From the "fire" attribute, the fire spirits, Enki, were born.
And from the "wind" attribute, the wind spirits, High Elves, were born.

Up to this point, it was still within a semblance of reason, but from here, the ancestor's recklessness really kicked off. That asshole experimented with breeding these races and gave birth to various species. To be honest, for a lady like me, it was quite a shock. The result was the birth of various species such as dwarves, ogres and beastmen, which were successful examples. There were many failures that faded into obscurity and later deteriorated into goblin-like monsters.

Guy-sama was also worried that this couldn't be left alone. But as long as Veldanava was left alone, we couldn't punish the Ancestor. As a result of its experiments, the diversity had certainly increased. One might say that the world had become more complicated, but it had also become more interesting. Not my problem, but *his* problem.

"I don't suppose you enjoy watching me get in trouble, do you?"

"No way, no way! That's a misunderstanding, Guy-sama. I'm Guy-sama's faithful maid," I said with an elegant curtsy. The fact that I was able to get away with it must be the result of my daily training.

Well, I was troubled by the Ancestor as I survived such a critical situation. However, its experiments led to its downfall.

"Ah! My daughter! You are my masterpiece---"

"It is time for judgment 'Disintegration'!"

Having its own body turned into dust by its own daughter like that, I guess it had it coming, huh? Between you and me, this is the secret episode of the fifth demon lord, Luminas-sama.

![break]

After that, the sixth one to become demon lord was Dino-sama. By the way, can I be frank with you? What? I already am? Well then, guess I don't need to be shy. Here goes.
I don't like honoring Dino with "-sama". Why? Because he's a lazy turd. He just doesn't work. He's the perfect example of depravity. I could have forgiven him if he was merely lazy, but no, he also makes *me* do *more* work! That is unacceptable.

I can't let him keep getting away with this. If he's going to do this, he should just go to Mizeri, and I will forgive him in a heartbeat. And when I asked him that, do you know what that guy said?

"No, because I'll get in trouble if I ask Mizeri, right?"

Of course! Screw this! This is not just pissing me off, this is also like saying that Mizeri is scarier than me. Well, I get pissed off a lot, too, but not that I don't have bad things to say about Mizeri...

What? Similarity? Are you stupid? Do you think you can handle a Primordial? Here are Raine's words of advice: In this world, there are things that are permissible to say and things that are not. People who don't understand that deserve to get beaten to death.

![hard scene break]

In this way, six people became demon lords, and the Walpurgis started to become more like a business debriefing session. Before I knew it, what was supposed to be a mere tea party had turned into a business meeting. It sounds cumbersome, so I'll pass.

"Raine!"

Uh, I was kidding. I will do my duty as a guide. Everyone seems to be very busy, except maybe that one person who's been slacking off all the time. If you look closely, there are a lot of people working, but that important task of managing the human race hasn't diminished at all, has it?

![break]

First of all, Guy-sama. What a madhouse he is already in. Except for Walpurgis, Mizeri was also helping desperately. I have to support her. I ended up taking care of the cooking and laundry, unwillingly, mind you.

Next, Milim-sama. Here, too, she is also more serious than you might think. If there are skirmishes between nations, she would go to them and teach them both harsh lessons. If a country is under attack by a large magic beast, she would go there to help people. She doesn't always act like a demon lord, but that's typical of Milim-sama.

And then we have Ramiris-sama, the social recluse. She doesn't come out of the labyrinth of her own making, but that's okay. I owe Ramiris-sama a debt of gratitude, so I can forgive anything. Dagruel-sama is in the same situation. After all, it seems to be a huge mess to clean up after that carnage. He doesn't have time for anything else, just slowing down the desertification would already be a great help.

The amazing one is Luminas-sama. She's exemplary, a far cry from that Ancestor. Before I knew it, she had complete control over the vampire forces. On top of that, she is protecting the humans who have lost their strength. The vampires who used to see humans as prey, now follow Luminas-sama's orders to protect the human race. No point mincing words, how is that even possible? That's seriously a great accomplishment.

And next, in contrast to Luminas-sama, is that piece of crap.

"Dino-sama, why don't you work a little harder?"

"I don't need you to tell me that!"

I don't understand. Was there ever a greater insult than this? No, I guess that's why Dino is a natural enemy of mine. In any case, under the circumstances, six people wasn't enough. Therefore, I started to recruit more people.

![break]

But then Luminas-sama retired. The reason for this was that the new recruits were too stupid to read the room. Many tried to pick on Luminas-sama and Ramiris-sama. Finally, they went on a rampage to show them what they were made of, but by then she had run out of patience with them.

Luminas-sama is a beautiful girl, and those small fry that failed to see her true strength would think she was beneath them. In order to break through this situation, she may have decided that it would be more advantageous to have a more dangerous looking being as the demon lord. As such, Roy was instated as Luminas-sama's substitute.

"I shall now go behind the scenes to support everyone," she said. "I'll put Roy in the front as the demon lord, is that all right with you all?"

If this were Dino's statement, he would have been accused by everyone of trying to slack off. However, this is Luminas-sama, the trusted and proven leader. With things being what they were, everyone accepted it willingly. So that started a new era where powerful majins began to rise in prominence as demon lords. By then, anyone would become eligible simply by acquiring the Demon Lord Seed. Having fulfilled this requirement, ambitious majins, such as Kazalim, became demon lords.

![break]

Once again, the purpose of Walpurgis changed. It was decided that a meeting would be held with the endorsement of three people to make a treaty or an agreement between the demon lords. It was also decided that it would be at this meeting where new demon lords would be approved or not.

Personally, that was a funny development. But, well, Guy-sama seemed to have no complaints about it, because it served its purpose. If Guy-sama didn't mind it, then I cannot complain either. Therefore, a new system was established.

![hard scene break]

While looking after Guy-sama's personal matters, I served as a guide for the occasional Walpurgis banquets. A number of demon lords have come and gone. Before long, the name of the Ten Great Demon Lords began to stick among the populace. And then that slime came onto the scene---Demon Lord Rimuru-sama.

I first saw him in the Walpurgis started by Demon Lord Clayman. Oh, I still miss Clayman, kind of. Even though he was weaker than me, I can admit that he had quite the courage to call himself a demon lord. Besides, he was good at coordinating and was surprisingly useful. If I pushed him a little, he'd take care of the troublesome work too, how convenient. Oh dear, I wonder where he went wrong...

I guess he picked a fight with the wrong person, what a shame. Mizeri, who went to pick up Rimuru-sama, came back and said "Clayman's luck is running out," and that's exactly how it turned out. I was the host of the meeting, but once I gave the floor to Rimuru-sama, it became a one-sided affair.

It was refreshing to watch, but there was one thing that bothered me. It wasn't so much related to Rimuru-sama, but rather, Ramiris-sama's servant.

"Isn't that one from the black lineage?"

"Right. I felt his presence when I picked up Rimuru-sama, so I'm sure of it."

"No way. He's so free-spirited and selfish, how could one possibly follow someone like that?"

"Well, I don't know, do you? I don't know what he's thinking, and I don't want to know or care what he thinks, but..."

Well, that's right. I think it's as Mizeri says, that Noir the Black Primordial is both selfish and whimsical. He's one of us Primordials, but honestly, I don't want to get involved with him. Why? Because he tied with Guy-sama!
Even if Mizeri and I challenged him together, we would have had a difficult time. That fact made me feel a sense of weakness, even though I had never fought him in person. No, that's giving ourselves a little too much credit. Not just having a difficult time against him, I honestly believe that both of us can't win together against him.

Guy-sama and Black weren't serious at all. The two of them were just playing with each other, but the battle was in a realm we couldn't follow. Well, I have my pride as a Primordial, so I won't ever admit it. If possible, I really don't want to get into trouble with Black.

![hard scene break]

This is the worst. I'm going to fight with Black. What did I do... I had always been a good girl, I wonder why. Maybe they found out that I stole Mizeri's treats? No, I chalked it up to one of my archdemon's doing. So why? I wonder, but stuff happens.

I decided that this was an opportunity, because I don't like him. He doesn't have any factions, he does things on his own, and he's willing to stand in Guy-sama's way. He could incarnate if he wanted to, but I'm annoyed that he wasn't interested in it. In other words, I was pissed off that he didn't evolve and remained an archdemon for a long time, as if he had no interest in the world.

By the looks of it, those three colors are still locked in a stalemate. That too was probably Black's handiwork agitating them. If he's any bit a demon, then he should follow the rules and aim for the future of evolution!

Indeed, I gotta give him a good beat-down. He's strong, yeah, but so am I. I don't think I could win, but *maybe* I can win. Fighting is also about compatibility. Black doesn't know what I'm capable of, so I think he might let his guard down. So, if I go for it, there's a chance. Positivity is one thing I have going for me.

Fully armed with theoretical backing, I was ready for the battle with Black.

.........

......

...

"I could feel such a fierce killing intent, it's just that I couldn't withdraw myself for a few minutes until now. By the way, I'd prefer you call me Diablo, Bleu---excuse me, you've already gotten the name Raine."

I was a little happy to hear that.
I thought he wasn't interested in other people, but now he even remembers my name.
Hehe, maybe I should rethink that a little.

"Yes. My name is Raine. It was given to me by the great Guy-sama the Red Primordial, the strongest of our Primordial breed. Not like you, who was named by some demon lord mutt of some unknown species."

I felt a little better and tried to rile him up a little. So, I called Rimuru-sama a mutt. Personally, I like the slime because he's cute, and Rimuru-sama seems to be a good demon lord, so I thought it would be a good tactic against Black---I mean, Diablo.

Well...now that was a *bad* idea.

"Huh? Do you have a death wish? Actually, you are asking to disappear from this world, no? Kufufufufu, allow me to grant you your wish."

Wow, he looked really serious. What a surprise. You know, Diablo wasn't the type to let everyone know what he's thinking. I didn't expect him to get *that* pissed off and show *that* much emotion.

"Let's fight, Diablo! Oh, I'm looking forward to it. I've been wanting to fight you ever since I've sensed you fighting the White Primordial in the east."

![break]

What a relief it was that I was using the Skill 'Mist'. Since I split up my body beforehand, I could come back even if one of me died. Otherwise, I would never want to fight an opponent that I might not be able to beat.

By the way, I was indeed really interested in the battle between Diablo and Blanc the White Primordial, because I had also fought her. The reason was, you know, jealousy. For some reason, Diablo had respect for the White Primordial. I wanted to see what that power was like.

As I recall, I was able to bring the fight with Blanc to a draw thanks to 'Mist'. To put it the other way around, that was a loss---no, it was still a tie. A **tie**. Only to Guy-sama can I admit defeat, because I'm a capable girl.

As I was thinking all this, the battle began to heat up. Maybe I was too serious as I hunted down Diablo with everything I had. In terms of magicules, we're evenly matched in quantity, I may even have more than him---not. I'm not stupid enough to be so careless. Diablo said that he didn't need to be serious against me. It's frustrating, but I think he meant what he said.

"Are you a sore loser? I know you just incarnated and can't give it your all, but that's no excuse, okay?"

I tried to tell him that, but deep down, I really know. I know that this pervert is not that stupid. He's one of the top two guys I thought were trouble. He would never make the kind of mistakes that some small fry would make. However, what happened next was beyond what I expected.

Before I knew it, a stacked magic circle painted with glowing spells had appeared around me. Wait, what? Isn't that spell holy magic, which demons are not good at? Luminas-sama's signature 'Disintegration' spell was aimed at me from all directions. It was at that moment I knew, I ~~fucked up~~ might have lost.

.........

......

...

Now you must be worried. Of course I'm fine. Didn't I just say that I have the 'Mist' Skill to be safe? Girls will hate you for that kind of nitpicking. Don't think, but feel. Just sympathize with them and they'll be happy. Same goes for me!

That Diablo guy is beyond rude. He took it upon himself to bring up another person in the middle of a battle. Testarossa? Who is that? You gotta bring her here. I was so indignant, but I was surprised to find out later that he was talking about the White Primordial. I mean, what? Let's calm down for a minute. Wait a minute, why *does* Blanc have a name?

I was still trying to set up Diablo, though I knew he would see through my act. I thought that would happen, because he's been a very tricky character since he was the Black Primordial. It pisses me off, though. Even the multi-stage 'Disintegration' wasn't a secret to him. If it weren't for this guy, I would have laughed at him for being a sore loser.

For now, the Testarossa case is more important. This is a very serious situation indeed. Not just for me, but also for Guy-sama who was hiding with me at that time. For a while now, Diablo has been proudly talking about Demon Lord Rimuru. It was annoying with all the *Rimuru-sama* this and *Rimuru-sama* that and so on and so forth. It's too much of a distraction to talk about important topics. What annoys me is that he's doing it for real.

Guy-sama seems to be annoyed, but I have to put up with it because he is my partner. I managed to get out the shocking story of how Demon Lord Rimuru has taken on other Primordials as his subordinates. I don't want to believe it. As soon as you are made to believe that, you have strategically lost the battle. Unfortunately, it seems to be true.

![break]

This is the worst.

The White Primordial Blanc is Testarossa.
The Purple Primordial Violet is Ultima.
The Yellow Primordial Jaune is Carrera.

Until now, we've had all of the powers hanging in balance for the longest time, but now it's collapsing in an instant. This kind of change is something I would like to see happen over the next few decades or centuries, but the reality is cruel. I sometimes think that living freely without constraints is the right way for a demon...but shouldn't we be competing with each other? No matter how you look at it, isn't it wrong to be united by a single force? Then one side is too strong, and there would be no competition.

He had done it, hadn't he...Demon Lord Rimuru? I think he's dangerous from the bottom of my heart. Until now, the Ancestor asshole and the annoying Noir---I mean, Diablo---have been the top two on my list of problems. But today, right now, Demon Lord Rimuru has taken the top spot by a landslide.

He is the one I should be worried about at all costs. Hostility should be avoided, even if it means rubbing salt in the wound. Unlike Guy-sama, I'm a good girl. I would never want to offend him, and I will go with the flow and call him "Rimuru-sama" like I really mean it. I decided in my mind that it was the way to go.

![hard scene break]

We pulled back, leaving things to chance. This was very unusual, because Guy-sama's real purpose was to deal with the very serious force he sensed being activated on the spot.

"Yes. No matter what happens here, Rimuru-sama will take care of it."

Diablo was boasting, but I can't believe that Guy-sama accepted it. However, as his maid, it is out of the question for me to question Guy-sama's decision. In the end, I left the situation to Rimuru-sama, and I was relieved that it turned out to be the right decision.

Guy-sama was worried about Luminas-sama. Her control of Western Nations has made Guy-sama's job much easier. Of course, he should be worried about it. The same goes for me. There's no way I'm going to take over. Anyway, I'm glad to hear that everything worked out fine. It's a shame that Mizeri failed her mission, but what can you do when you're dealing with Testarossa the White Primordial.

![break]

"Was she strong?"

"I didn't fight her, but she looked nasty. Having a name and a body made her a demon peer. She's a lot stronger than a third-rate demon lord."

Yeah, I guess. Even when I fought her, she was already giving me a hard time. Now that she's evolved, she might be too much to handle. In the first place, she didn't care much about winning or losing. She's willing to accept tactical defeats as long as she can get the result she wants. That's why that woman is unfazed by defeat.

She was number three on my top secret troublemaker list---now number four. Oh, actually, she's still number three because the Ancestor was vaporized. Wow, looking at it this way, the top members of the trouble squad are all in Rimuru-sama forces. Carrera is also dangerous, and Ultima is a landmine if handled incorrectly. I have a lot of respect for him, controlling those guys.

"Let's try not to pick a fight with Rimuru-sama."

"I'd like to say something all of a sudden, but I understand what you mean and I agree with you. Rather, that's the line I also wanted to say to you."

"How rude. I'm not going to cross that troublesome guy, either."

"Really? You're the one who wanted to challenge Guy-sama to a fight. That's unbelievable."

That was, well, a youthful indiscretion. I'm growing up and I won't make the same mistake. And so, that's how we came to look at Rimuru-sama.

![hard scene break]

This is bad, This is bad! Rimuru-sama, he's really bad! It's the first time I met him, but he's seriously dangerous! What? I already met him at Walpurgis? Shut up. I'm telling you that Rimuru-sama is so bad that it doesn't matter! All I can say is, "Oh, no!" but so would everyone in my shoes. Why? Listen to me, Rimuru-sama evolved us as well!

Unbelievable, isn't it? But it's true. Even though I'm a demon, I'm a good girl who tells the truth. But with this, I can be of service to Guy-sama now. In terms of strength, I had barely been acknowledged by Guy-sama. In fact, if I had to take on the Octagram guys, there wasn't a single one among them that I could beat.

But now that I think about it, the current demon lords are impeccable. I think I could beat Ramiris-sama, but I'm a bit iffy on that. If she gained her true form, I'd be looking at a loss. I want to hurt that jerk Dino, but if I do, I'll end up being the one who cries. That's why I'll forgive him, and want him to be thankful for my generosity. Oops, but I digress.

.........

......

...

It all started when Diablo called Guy-sama. That's why we came to visit Rimuru-sama's country, but Guy-sama was not happy because he was pushed around by Diablo. I thought, "wow, I'm going to be dragged into this, and I want to stay at home..." but no dice. However, it was the right decision to be there.

Rimuru-sama hadn't met Velzard-sama before and they were exchanging greetings. Afterwards, he greeted me very politely, *soooo charming*. I thought about pretending to be a misunderstood girl and going for him. Of course, I'm not so dense as to not be able to read the room. I'm pretty sure it would have been over for me if I did that, and I was right in the end.

And then, the friendly tea party began. I had been observing him behind Guy-sama. Surprisingly, Rimuru-sama somehow seems to be similar to Guy-sama. I saw that they reacted the same way and had a hard time with Diablo. I saw him and Guy-sama having the same reactions. Needless to say, it made me like him a lot more. But there were other things that bothered me, too.

First, Rimuru-sama's servant. That one seems to be called Benimaru, but why does he look stronger than some demon lords? The other one is Shion-san. She's become much stronger since the last time we met! I can somehow feel a hint of evil in her. Does she have an advantage over a demon?

What is this? Can I even win if I fight seriously? However, for me to admit my defeat would be to lose the meaning of my existence. No, that's not going to happen. I had no choice but to keep a cool face. But you know, that's easier said than done, because those two are not the only ones with those hints of strength.

Wait a sec, these aren't coming from Testarossa and the others. Then there must be at least three or four other people here besides them. Why are there so many demon lord class subordinates under a single demon lord's command? I thought that it was only possible for Guy-sama to do that, but it seems I need to change my mind.

![break]

As I was making up my mind, the aroma of tea wafted through the air.

Is it break time?
As the maids, it's bad manners for us to have tea together with everybody else. It's unfortunate, I guess we'll have to pass on this. We were whisked away to another room, which, to my surprise, had a cake prepared for us. Now that's what I'm talking about, Rimuru-sama! Just look at this attention to detail! I have to admit that he's more than qualified to be a king!

And then, we got our opportunity to taste it. Is this a strawberry shortcake? I may not look the part, but I am a professional chef. I even captured a head cook from a top-class hotel to learn his skills, so I'm proud to say that my cooking skills are second to none. In other words, I will not be satisfied with half-baked efforts.

"It's so good!"

![full page image](image13)

Are you kidding me?! This is so good! It looks simple on the outside, but it's a complex harmony of flavors. There are several layers with different kinds of cream in between. Hold on, aren't these the kind of things that take a lot of time and effort to make? The fact that the flavors are so evenly distributed shows that all the ingredients have been carefully planned out.

"So wonderful..."

Mizeri was also impressed. Our specialty has always been fresh fruitcakes and sugary pancakes that rely on high quality ingredients. I didn't expect to see so much technology being used in a single cake.

"Is this technology from the otherworld?" I asked absent-mindedly.

"That's right," Shion-san answered. "This is a strawberry shortcake made with three kinds of cream, developed by Mr. Yoshida and Shuna-sama during the competition. It also contains a small amount of black rice powder, which is very popular among monsters."

Yoshida-san is an otherworlder, isn't he? I knew who Shuna-sama was. She is the person who showed us around and even served us. With her smooth, refined movements and an unassuming, yet imposing demeanor, even a "perfect maid" like me couldn't resist rating her highly for her excellent customer service. On top of that, her cooking skills were also quite impressive.

While enjoying the cake, I talked to that damned Diablo.

"By the way, aren't you stronger from the last time I fought you?"

I had been wondering. I had always wondered if he had gotten stronger since the last time I fought him. I couldn't ask him in front of Guy-sama, but now I could ask him in person. I can't miss this opportunity. Because ever since we evolved into demon peers, we haven't been able to gain any more strength.

We are getting stronger because we are gaining experience, right? Well, yes, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the existence itself that could not evolve. And yet, this Diablo guy did so easily...

"Kufufu, you're as clueless as ever, aren't you?" he chuckled.

What is this annoying feeling? I wonder why... Can I just give him a good smack? Yeah, sure---and my inner conscience is all for it. I think I should just go for it. Just as I was about to act on that idea, Diablo interrupted me again.

"Kufufufu. It is all thanks to my lord, Rimuru-sama. He has rewarded me for my services!"

Damn this bastard! What a showoff! I get it, I gotta respond in kind, then.

"Oh, I see. So then you're not much better off either. I agree with you that Rimuru-sama is great and all that, no doubt about it, but that's beside the point. *You* are relying on Rimuru-sama, aren't you?"

Well, that was my comeback for him. What do you think? It's only because of Rimuru-sama that he had evolved, so his own skills are not that big of a deal! However...

"Yes. That's right, want to make something of it?"

This Diablo bastard just nonchalantly admitted it. What's more, he's happily looking at me with eyes like, "You know that too!" Argh, this is *sooo* annoying. I don't even know who's the idiot at this point.

"Raine, don't do it. I don't think even Guy-sama would be able to win an argument with him. You're not going to make him cry, either," Mizeri chided me.

Unfortunately, she really did have a point.
I stared at Diablo in frustration. Then something unexpected happened. Shion-san smacked Diablo on the head, making a nice thwacking sound. That made me *so* happy, you don't even know. Moreover, she even preached to him.

"You're being cheeky, Tea-boy! You are not to be rude to our guests."

When I heard that, I couldn't help but pump my fist. Glancing to the side, I saw Mizeri smiling happily. Of course she did. This is just too funny not to laugh! Then, leaving us alone, Diablo and Shion-san started fighting, which continued until Shuna-sama came onto the scene.

![break]

Shuna-sama. I have no qualms in adding the "-sama" for her anymore. While Shion-san quarreling with Diablo is already amazing, Shuna-sama, who can yell at both Shion-san and Diablo at the same time, was the most wonderful, in my point of view. There's a lot to learn from her. By the way, the "fight" between Diablo and Shion-san really was just a verbal fight, which surprised both Mizeri and me.

Shuna-sama then came to call us, so we obeyed quietly. She told us that she would teach us the recipe for the cake. We were very grateful. I must tell her how I feel when I am shown into the parlor where Rimuru-sama is.

"As expected of Demon Lord Rimuru-sama, the cake was wonderful."

I also expressed my gratitude while being flustered by Mizeri stealing my thunder.

"I am deeply moved that you have been so generous in teaching me your recipe."

Then Rimuru-sama laughed and said it was no big deal.

"Thank you. I would be glad if we could continue working together in the future."

Did he just call that cooperation when we only received it unilaterally? That's very generous of him. However, it seemed like my recognition was still insufficient.

"You guys, Rimuru will grant you strength. You should be more grateful," Guy-sama suddenly told me...that Mizeri and I were given the honor of evolving into Devil Lords.

.........

......

...

See? That's dangerous, right? Really, just what is Rimuru-sama? Looking back on it now, all I can think of is that he's dangerous. We will make effective use of the power he's given us, and if he's ever in trouble, we'll be happy to help him. The amount of magicules is increasing day by day, and we can be of more help to Guy-sama than ever before. We owe it all to Rimuru-sama, and it is only natural that we should return the favor. However, there is Testarossa in his country, so I doubt there will be a day that requires my help...

That's enough self-deprecation now. It's time for today's mock battle with Mizeri. We have to train every day to get used to our own strength. Well then, to the training grounds---oh? I'm afraid I'm not in the mood for such joking around at this hour.

"Raine! Someone just broke into the 'Barrier.'"

"I know, I know. But this is---"

This is no longer a time for mock battles, let alone for idle chatter. That's it for me. I look forward to seeing you all again.
