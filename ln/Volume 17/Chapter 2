# Chapter 2: Distant|Memories

Velgrynd took her first leap into the strange space between unknown worlds. There, she found herself unbounded by time and confronted her inner self. By doing so, she made the Ultimate Skill 'Divine Flame King Cthugha' completely her own. The Ultimate Skill 'Divine Flame King Cthugha' had the power to track Rudra's soul. Strictly speaking, the effect was to discover an entity once specified. Velgrynd can now find pieces of her beloved Rudra's soul, no matter how remote or far away they are, even beyond time and space.

All she has to do now is 'jump' for it. It is a perfect combination of Spacetime Manipulation and Dimension Leap, a technique that is only possible with the Ultimate Skill's ever-growing power. However, it was impossible to jump to a specific time and place because the target coordinates could not be determined. In other words, the 'Spacetime Leap' is only possible when there is a destination.

However, this does not apply if the time and space are the same. Even 'Instantaneous Movement' was possible because it could travel over any distance without regard to time. That is why Velgrynd relied on her own authority to pursue Rudra.

![break]

First, she found herself on a starry continent where civilization was still in its infancy. A barbarian chief with bronze skin. The young, blond-haired youth was the one who had a fragment of Rudra's soul in him. The young men were hunters and had eventually settled in the Great River Valley. Velgrynd helped them without her own weight. She brought rain and conquered the great rivers and made the land fertile. It was around this time that she began to move away from hunting and pursued agriculture. Their food situation improved greatly and the number of mouths they could feed increased. Soon the village became one that was feared by the surrounding villages. It makes sense for the rich to be targeted.

So Velgrynd prepared her next move. She gave them a high-temperature furnace hot enough to withstand the melting point of iron, which could be called out of place in that era. This allowed the people to skip bronze ware from stone tools, and take possession of iron tools instead. It was decided that the surrounding villages would be swallowed and combined together, and the land eventually developed into a kingdom. The throne was passed on to sons and grandchildren. Velgrynd stopped helping the kingdom and simply stuck with what she loved. No matter how much they begged her, she did not exercise her authority. Because that's what her beloved wanted.

"I am indebted to you more than I can ever repay. But I don't want more. It will be too much power for those fools when I retire as king."

"Yeah, okay. Rudra."

Velgrynd had no reason to help the king's sons and grandsons, since they lacked a trace of soul. She could help on a whim, but as the king's desire was for his children to be independent, Velgrynd would respect that will.

"Tsk, not 'Rudra' again. My name is---tch, if I have other lovers, is it any wonder if I'm not taken seriously?"

"Hmmm. Jealous? You're so cute."

"Shut up. I'm going to kill you alive in front of such a superb woman."

True to his word, the man who rose from barbarian chief to the first king of the Kingdom of Arcia, the founder of the Great River Civilization, treated her like she was his goddess, but he never embraced Velgrynd in his arms. Velgrynd was fine with that. Her role is to watch over. Loved ones beget children and the bloodline is inherited. And so she waits for another piece of Rudra's soul to dwell in their offspring.

That was Velgrynd should be. A time of growth and prosperity. The good times pass quickly. The young man had grown old and was now an old man waiting for his death.

"I was happy. Goddess. You---you called me master, but did I live up to it?"

"Yes, enough. I was happy, you know."

"Well, I'm relieved to hear that. Bless you."

Those were the last words of a great king. With a muffled cry, he gave his soul to Velgrynd. In this way, Velgrynd got the 'soul' she desired. But it was only a fragment of it. The journey has just begun, and Velgrynd leaps toward her next destination. The Kingdom eventually conquered the surrounding nations and became an empire. Those who remained, left it for posterity in the form of biographies.

And so, a myth was born. The young man's blood runs through the veins of the Holy Arcia Empire, where Velgrynd has long been revered as the Goddess of Creation, who controls the flames.

![hard scene break]

Velgrynd had a series of encounters and goodbyes. Through it all, Velgrynd came to understand that there is no single world that Veldanava has created. He created many worlds. There was one world, and there were no parallel worlds. But there were other worlds.

There were 'otherworlders,' so she was aware of that fact, but Velgrynd had never imagined that there were so many different worlds. They were governed by completely different laws, and there was no causality. It was a material world within a great spiritual world of many different civilizations. From the familiar world where swords and magic are the norm, to the world where magic is non-existent and cannot be used. There was also a rare world where scientific civilization had developed and humankind had become mechanized. There were weak worlds that could be blown away by a True Dragon if it unleashed all of its strength, and there were desolate worlds where angels and demons comparable to awakened Demon Lords were in constant conflict.

Velgrynd had traveled through all those worlds. But all of it was not of her own intention, but by what she was guided to. There were different levels of civilization, and Velgrynd had no way of guessing which dimension or timeline she was in. Also, because parallel universes do not overlap, it is impossible for the same entity to overlap on the same timeline. In other words, just because you went there once does not mean you can go to the same place. If the Velgrynd exists in the same dimension at the same time, the exact space-time coordinates can be recognized. However, as there is already a Velgrynd at that time, 'Spacetime Leap' cannot be used to jump there, even with the Ultimate Skill 'Divine Flame King Cthugha'.

![break]

So Velgrynd remembered all worlds, all of Rudra. The fleet commander of the interstellar world. The minister of a small country in the world of swords and magic. The rare scammer in the world without magic. The poor scientist in the civilized world. Velgrynd is often called upon at moments of crisis when one who possesses a fragment of Rudra's 'soul' is in danger. It is only when he is on the verge of death that his soul shines forth.

Some people died as children because they couldn't get help in time. It was a very sad event, but Velgrynd is convinced that it was fate. And there was no need to mourn, because then the soul shards would gather quickly. But she didn't take it upon herself to hasten the time. It was the Velgrynd's pleasure to watch over Rudras of various personalities.

She realized early on that bloodlines were meaningless. Even physical characteristics meant nothing, some had dark hair, some had red hair. But all of them were 'Rudra' to Velgrynd. And it would continue to be that way for many stars. The pieces of soul she had gathered were growing in size and regaining their beautiful form. Just by intuition, Velgrynd was convinced that there were only a few pieces of soul left. The next one or one after that would be the last. And so, she did as she was called, and jumped into the world.

![hard scene break]

It was called the Empire. In the Emperor's room, Velgrynd appears from time and space. She is dressed in a silk robe. It's a deep blue color that suits her very well. Velgrynd was noticed by the old emperor, the owner of the room.

"---Who are you?"

The Emperor, frail with age and infirmity, is lying in his large, luxurious bed. A suspicious woman had suddenly appeared in the room, so it would only be natural to be surprised. The emperor's courage was considerable, as he only spoke out. Velgrynd didn't care.

"Oh? You're an old man this time. It's been a long time ago. You remind me of the barbarian king by the looks of it."

![full page image](image6)

To Velgrynd, 'old age' is irrelevant. It's just a form of the human condition. So she reached out and brought her hand affectionately to the old man's cheek and whispered to him.

"Velgrynd. That's my name. And you are?"

"Have you no fear of me? And are you a god or goddess of power?"

Suddenly, a sword slashed at Velgrynd's throat, but it was interrupted by a white-fish-like finger which held out without looking back. The sword strike of brutality that slashes the evil spirit was received without even a drop of blood flowing. Of course, it was not done by the Emperor, but by one who stood by as a guardian.

His name was Araki Gensei.^[Translation kept coming out as "Arcane Wood," but the hiragana reads as "Araki Gensei"] He is the guardian and sword bearer of the kingdom who wards off evil spirits. He is the greatest swordsman of the present generation and is the current head of the Oboro Shinmei Style.^[Kanji/hiragana seems to read as "Oboro Shinmei-ryu" so "Oboro Shinmei Style"] Although he was only in his early 30s, he was appointed as the 'guardian of the emperor' because of his strength. Not even Gensei's sword could hurt Velgrynd. That was only natural, but from Gensei's point of view, it was an anomaly that was beyond comprehension.

"Who would have thought that my sword would fail me?---You are in charge of protecting His Majesty!"

"Got it!"

The one called Minamoto by Gensei was a young man, still in his early twenties. Minamoto Sanrou. Like Gensei, had completely disappeared and was on the Emperor's guard. Even among Gensei's disciples, he was the third most skilled master.

"Oh, you don't have to be so careful. I know you guys must be great, but it's just cute from my point of view."

"Let me tell you. I may not be able to match you, but I can at least buy some time."

"That's true. It would be hard to tell me to trust you. Well, okay, but I hope you won't take that person out."

Velgrynd shrugged her shoulders. Even if she wasn't trusted, the burden on the Emperor was unacceptable. Velgrynd saw that the Emperor's life was running out. It would be a shame to put out its last fires for her own sake. She wanted to let him live out his last hours in peace. It was Minamoto who took the blame. Just Velgrynd's stare was enough to make him stiffen his whole body. Just feeling the pressure of her gaze was enough to make him realize the vast difference in their abilities. No, it's not even that level.

The monsters and demons they've dealt with are so obscure that they almost seemed cute in comparison. As soon as his master Gensei's sword failed to get through, he knew that the Velgrynd was trouble. He had no choice but to realize that even that was still a naive perception.

*I'm not going to be able to do my job*, Minamoto thought ruefully. So, at the very least, he summoned up all the courage he could muster and glared at Velgrynd.

"Are you the demon's head, Gai?^[This was confusing, but it looks like '妖魔の首' means the 'demon's head,' and 魁 means 'Gai?' Not sure, so sorry.] Did you get tired of the skirmishes and have come to us yourself?"

He was just talking in a cold sweat. It's a statement meant to expose her, but Velgrynd sees through it and replies without a care in the world.

"A demon? So, there are demons in this world too. They really spring up everywhere, don't they?"

"Oh, so you have nothing to do with demons?"

"No, it's not related. In the first place, I'm not sure if the demon you're talking about is the same ones I know."

Velgrynd can parse and speak any language from any world with fluency. It is a special skill that does not rely on authority because it can read the 'thoughts' that fly around in the world. However, some similar concepts can be confused, and care must be taken not to make a mistake. In this case, the word 'demon' is important. What Velgrynd knows is that it is a phantom race with the demon king Feldway at the top. He was an Aggressor tribe in every dimension and had many collisions with the Velgrynd throughout her long journey. Velgrynd was disgusted that he was there this time as well, but at the same time, she also considered the possibility that he might be different.

"A demon is a demon. I myself do not know much about them."

The answer to Velgrynd's question came not from Minamoto, but from the Emperor himself. Gensei immediately changed his mind when he saw that Minamoto was unable to move. While Minamoto was attracting his attention, Gensei tried to get the Emperor to flee. Gensei and his team's trust in each other was at an all-time high as they changed roles at a moment's notice. Although there was no chance of success, the plan to let the Empeeror escape was worth a try. But the Emperor himself had stopped it.

"Your Majesty?!"

"It's all right. Why do I get a familiar feeling from this person? And where in the world are we going to escape to when we're already in the safest place in the heavily fortified Imperial City? This person evaded all security measures to get to this place. I don't think we'd be able to escape."

It was just as the Emperor had said. The Empire, the country of the Grand Duke, was now at war with a formidable enemy. That's why they were on high alert, and any attempt to sneak through it would be tantamount to defeat. Besides, the Emperor couldn't bring himself to be wary of Velgrynd. As he said, he felt a nostalgic feeling, which was somewhat comforting. So the Emperor decided to believe in Velgrynd. He decided to tell her what was going on, and if it was possible, he wanted her to become his ally.

![soft scene break]

The current location is still the Emperor's quarters. He had ordered the maid to prepare tea and snacks for us.

"Let me introduce myself first. My name is Velgrynd, as I said before."

"I am Araki Gensei. I am the guardian of the kingdom and the protector of His Majesty."

"I am the third-ranked member of the Imperial Guard, Minamoto Saburo. I have been appointed as a captain of the Imperial Guard Swordsmen."

"Yeah, nice to meet you. And Rudra?"

Velgrynd was not interested in those two. She brushed off the greetings from them and turned her attention back to her beloved.

"At my age, I never thought I'd be stared at by such a beautiful woman. I don't feel bad about it, but I can't help but feel sorry for my younger self."

"Well, Rudra also flatters me. It's a rare experience."

"Huh, it's not flattery, but oh well. I have been known as Sakura Akira.^[The Japanese name in Kanji was 桜明 which can translate as Sakura Akira. The hiragana next to the Kanji was おう はる which basically sounds like Ou Haru. Sometimes I've seen the name translated as Ou Akira, but I think using the Kanji Sakura Akira works okay for now until a Japanese speaker can actually translate.] I thought it was reasonably well known, but I guess I just liked it."

It was a posthumous name, widely known as the wise empeor, but it was a taboo. It is the true name of the emperor and should not be casually spoken. Even those closest to him would not call him by that name. But it was a name that everyone in the land knew with respect. But to the Velgrynd, he was Rudra. She had no intention of calling him that from the stat, let alone not calling him 'Sakura'.

"Ufufu, well, it's no wonder I don't know you. Because I came into this world the moment I first met you. The 'you' who I know is named Rudra, so that's what I'm going to keep calling you."

To the others, she seemed rude to him. But it was officially allowed. The Emperor laughed it off.

"Allowed."

"Your Majesty?!"

"It doesn't matter. If it will buy the goddess' pleasure, it's a small price to pay. However, I can't allow her to stand next to me in public."

"Oh, why is that?"

"I, too, have my position. It would only cause my subjects unnecessary anxiety if there was someone calling me by a name they don't know."

If Velgrynd showed her power to everyone, it would be disruptive. The Emperor wanted to keep things quiet and out of sight. Velgrynd understands this and stops asking for more. She would have listened quietly if Rudra had asked her, so she agreed for now. For now, it was more important to listen to the situation.

"Then let's think about to would do if we had to go out in public. So, can you explain to me what the situation is now?"

Velgrynd is no dead weight. If Rudra is in trouble, she'll do her best to help. The two guards got a headache from such a transcendental attitude.

*That Velgrynd is an unfathomable competitor. His Majesty was right. She may be a kind of god or goddess. Perhaps it's better to ask for cooperation rather than to humiliate.*

Gensei thought. Minamoto, on the other hand, is more complicated.

*It's not an attitude towards His Majesty, but why? It just seems natural, doesn't it? This disqualifies me from being a bodyguard, but if the Emperor allows it, it's not my place to speak. But I don't know how I would explain it to His Highness or Her Highness.*

More specifically, he was thinking about the problems that would arise. As an emperor, he can't be blamed for one or two mistresses and vice versa. The birth of a child would also involve the issue of hereditary succession, so she must be a woman of strong family background. It was also necessary to make the position clear; there was an insurmountable difference in status between the empress and the concubine. In this case, the Velgrynd must be convinced to be a member of the household.

*Is she really thee kind of woman who can live with that? If she insists on being the empress, there's nothing we can do...*

Minamoto is the kind of person who worries about such things, but his real job is to protect the Imperial Palace. No, he was not overly concerned, as any trouble the Velgrynd might have with the Empress or her entourage would be a disaster. There was a big difference in the psychological burden between Gensei, who only had to protect the Emperor, and Minamoto, who had to look out for the safety of the entire palace. Nevertheless, right now, Minamoto thought it was time to answer Velgrynd's question.

"I'll explain that myself. The environment surrounding our country, the Empire, is very tense. One of the biggest enemies we have seen in the past..."

![break]

The Imperial State means the state ruled by Emperor, and is different in meaning from the Empire, which is the state of the Great Conquest. Unlike the name of the present, it was a title passed down from generation to generation in the eastern island nations. The emperor and his guardians protected their subjects from demons. But apart from that, the world was in turmoil.

In the east, the Empire. In the south, the United States of Azalea. In the north, the Great Roziam Dynasty. In the west, the Holy Arcia Empire. In the center, the Middle Kingdom of China was working together with a Japanese country.^[Confusing to understand, but I think a portion of the raws said "Sino-japanese" referring to Chinese/Japanese working together.] In each region, they emerged as the standard-bearers of the five major powers. Decades ago, they competed for supremacy, but eventually they came to an equilibrium. While looking with an eye on the decline of the other forces, the economic relationship had been maturing for some time. When this happened, conflict no longer surfaced, and peace seemed to have returned to the world.

However, dissatisfaction amongst the major powers has not disappeared. If there are those who make profit, then there will be those who will lose, and dissatisfaction will accumulate. And so, four years ago, it exploded.

The catalyst was a great drought in the middle of China. Water shortages led to famine, and epidemics were rampant. Humanity was understandably distressed, but the Chinese government, in order to protect its own position, turned its discontent to the outside world. And this is what the whole world is caught up in.

The Chinese first turned their attention to the South, which was as rich in grain fields as their own. The National People's Congress unanimously voted to invade the United States of Azalea. This was the signal for the start of the war. And in the blink of an eye, warfare spread throughout the world. Seeing the Chinese move their armies, the North moved next. The Great Roziam Dynasty began its invasion of China. The aim was clear: to secure a rich granary and a perennial port. The country was suffering from the natural disaster of drought, but that would subside in a few years. Under such a decision, the Great Roziam Dynasty resurrected its hegemony.

The Chinese would not allow it. It was decided to gather its remaining forces to counterattack and plunge the country into full-scale war. The empire was caught in the middle of this. Their dependence on the Chinese for food imports compelled them to send their troops to China in the name of humanitarian aid. It was an effort to bring this war to a quick conclusion, but the Great Roziam Dynasty was furious. Relations with the United States of Azalea were also deteriorating. Faced with a choice between Azalea and China, the Empire has chosen to ally itself with China, its lifeline. Thus, the Empire is plunged into war with the United States of Azalea. The Holy Arcia Empire did not budge at first, but that peace did not last for a year. This time a famine broke out in their own country, and they became unable to provide aid.

Bad things continued to happen. There was an accident at the oil storage facility. As a result, three years' worth of fuel was burned down. From the trail left at the site, the culprit was determined to be an agent of the Great Roziam Dynasty. The public sentiment in the Holy Arcia Empire was turning toward the anti-Great Roziamism. With that, the Holy Arcia Empire was able to take advantage of the momentum and take military action.

There were those who questioned this course of events. Mystery Monk Pulcinella is a member of the Holy Spirit Sect, one of the three major religions of Buddhism, Holy Spiritism, and Free Spirit^[Liberalism or Freedom are also other possible translations]. He said he sensed someone's malice and left the oracle. After hearing these words, the Holy Churches around the world began to investigate and found a clue to the existence of the demon. But it was already too late.

![break]

"You've had your desires stimulated and anger inflamed for the right reasons."

"It's a shame, but you're right. On second thought, this was obviously a strange turn of events. But the people's anger, once kindled, was not going to go away easily."

"I don't need to mention the Holy Church, but the leaders of the nations also sensed the anomaly less than a year after the war began. And yet, there were extremists in the military as well. Even those people took advantage of the enemy's machinations and began to be active, and by the time they found themselves in a position where they realized it, there was no way to stop it."

To Minamoto's explanation, Gensei added, "The same is true in other countries."

The same was true in each country, and now it is out of line with the upper management. Those units that have been dispatched are now close to being out of control. And just a few days ago, across the sea, a great naval battle was fought between the U.S. fleet and the Imperial Navy, the pride of the Empire. The result was defeat. According to preliminary research, they were evenly matched in strength, but by now, the gap between them was nearly three times greater.

"The reason for this is the betrayal of the Chinese fleet. And the trouble is, it had nothing to do with the home country's intentions."

Since the Chinese leadership didn't know about it, there was no way for even our intelligence officers to know about it. By the time they found out, it was too late, and they had already caused a painful loss. But the defeat was not in vain.

"This information was brought to you by my apprentice, who risked his life for it. It was given to me by a man named Kondou who launched a suicide attack against the enemy fleet and dispersed with great fanfare before his death. The enemy commanders had been taken over by a demon."

Gensei said that David Reagan, commander of the United States Grand South Sea Fleet, and Li Jinlong, commander of the U.S. Eastern Sea Fleet, had played Kondou with their unorthodox powers. Kondou realized that he was beyond his power and tried to gather information until the end. And then he lost contact with them. Gensei seriously said that he might have made his life ephemeral.

Hearing that, Velgrynd understands. The man in Gensei's story is Lieutenant Kondou, whom Velgrynd knows well. That Kondou was fascinated by Rudra because he felt the same way about Emperor. Kondou instinctively knew that Rudra and Akira Sakura's 'soul' were one and the same. And so, for the first time, Velgrynd felt a closeness to Kondou. Finally, she could believe that his loyalty had been genuine. And so, this is not only Rudra's case, but also Kondou's regrets.

*I remember now that Kondou seemed to regret not being able to defend his country. That's why he worked for Rudra, no matter what he had to do, to make sure he never went through that again.*

After all this time, Velgrynd wonders if there is anything that she can do for Kondou. There is only one answer. There is only one way to get rid of Kondou's regrets. With that in mind, Velgrynd switches her mind to listen more intently. Unknowingly, Minamoto continues to explain. The existence of an alien entity that has the ability to possess and control people was quickly communicated to the world leaders. However, the leaders who were not on the scene had no way of knowing who was actually being controlled.

It was suspicious of those who deviated from the norm, but it was also difficult to recall the generals who were on the ground operations. There was even the possibility of going public with the truth, but that would have definitely caused a panic. There would be people who would wonder if their superiors were demons, and if that happened, even the chain of command could be destroyed. It could also lead to a domestic witch hunt. That must be stopped, so a secret investigation had been conducted. As a result, they learned that unlike most monsters, these creatures were organized. Moreover, they were active behind the scenes all over the world, with a clear intention to invade.

"Besides, they are strong. In our kingdom, we use a monster class ranking (Gai class)^[Hiragana says 怪 (かい) which is pronounced as 'Gai.'] to describe the strength of monsters, but even the weakest of them are equal to the top monsters. They are so formidable that even the most advanced swordsmen and martial artists can't stand up to them."

"The six levels of the Gai class are, from the top to the bottom are: God/Buddha, Mythical/Dragon monsters, Heavenly monsters, Advanced monsters, Intermediate demons, and Lower monsters.^[The translation for this was super confusing for me with MTL. I used the term "monster" instead of demon because I don't think they are just talking about the demon race (like Diablo and the primordials), but either one can be considered the correct term for Youkai. Also, the Mythical/Dragon class can also be translated as demon dragon or ogre or mythical depending on the translation. Just take it all with a grain of salt.] The middle and lower levels are called the Chimimoryō^[The term 魑魅魍魎 translated to Chimimoryo, or Malevolent/Deceptive Spirits of Mountains and Rivers] (Malevolent Spirits of Mountains and Rivers). The Advanced monsters to the Heavenly monsters, just before the Mythical/Dragon monsters, were called Evil Demon Rakshasa.^[The term 悪鬼羅刹 also translated as "Evil-doers" "Devil's Ramble" "Evil Demon Rama" "Akukirasetsu," etc.]"

Even the weakest of the monsters that had appeared this time were of Heavenly Monster class. Kondou and his men had revealed their true identity when they attacked the enemy fleet. They were defeated by the ringleader when theey passed on this information.

"Kondou-san believed that David and Li Jinlong's 'Gai-class' were higher than the Mythical/Dragon class. I'm sure he was right in his assessment."

"Why?"

"That's because Kondou-san is one of the strongest men here in Hinomoto."

Even at the time of the suicide attack, Kondou's skill level was top-notch. His mastery of the Kifuo-ryu style (spirit fighting style), the secret of Oboro Shinmei-ryu, enabled him to attain a high level of fighting ability at the Mythical/Dragon level. Still, the reason why he was defeated was because there were two enemies.

"Yes, that man was indeed a good one."

"---What?

"Huh?"

"Do you know Tatsuya?"

"Yes, Rudra. Kondou served you in the world I came from, too."

"For me? Well, Rudra, or whoeve it is, has the same soul as I do."

"That's right. And Kondou fought and died proudly for you over there, too."

"..."

The Emperor is speechless and dumbfounded. He was deeply disappointed in the death of a man who had been his loyal servant.

"Oh no, Kondou-san..."

Minamoto was incredulous as he muttered. Kondou was such an outstanding swordsman, and he wondered if he could have been the trump card against the demons had he still been alive. Now that he was confronted with the fact that he was dead, he didn't know what to do.

"I was hoping that Kondou was still alive, but it's a shame."

Master Gensei remained calm as he said this, but inwardly he struggled to hide the sadness that had arisen from the small amount of hope he had lost.

*It is out of the question to be distracted as someone in a responsible position. I have to calm myself down, he thought to himself.*

Everyone believed Velgrynd. It was unusual, but strangely enough, they felt her words were true. Velgrynd let everyone hear the story of Kondou's end. At the same time, she tried to figure out who the enemy was, given Kondou's strength.

*The only thing that matters is that Kondou could be defeated before he crossed over into the world. I think the word 'demon' refers to the phantom race, but if that's the case then my enemy---no. I can't be too sure. I don't have any standards to conclude anything, so I guess I'll just have to wait and see for now.*

Velgrynd was a confident being, a True Dragon at her best, but her loss to Rimuru had made her cautious. Although she didn't think it was the enemy, she would reserve her judgment until she had more information. In fact, her guess at this point was both right and wrong. The concentration of magic is so low in this world that there is no such thing as a remarkably strong monster. It was as if they had arrived from the other world and were so fierce that they were known as gods.

Even such individuals were no match for the violence of numbers, and through the cooperation of swordsmen and sorcerers, the numbers were reduced to an almost unseen level now. That's why there was no magic element pooling occurring. Therefore, it was difficult for powerful monsters to occur naturally. Unlike Veldora, the current Velgrynd completes her own mana circulation. It does not need to be replenished from the atmosphere and does not leave her body.

*This is a skill I learned when I crossed various worlds, that's why I was unaware the concentration of monsters and magic in this world.*

In the first place, crossing over worlds would normally be impossible. Even through the 'Underworld Gate', you are limited by the size of the gate. A person like Velgrynd, who can use 'Spacetime Leap' without any restrictions, is outside the laws of the world. Thus, compared to Velgrynd's magic-filled homeland, the standard of strength in this world was far inferior. That would soon be revealed.

![soft scene break]

With the help of the Emperor, Velgrynd was able to get a general idea of the situation. This world cannot be brought back to life and will soon fall into the hands of the invaders. The leaders of each country are aware of this fact, but they have allowed the military, which embodies the will of the people, to run amok to the point where there is no longer anything that they can do about it.

"So, what's going on with your enemy's movements?"

The enemy coalition fleet had defeated the Imperial Navy, of which Kondou belonged, but its subsequent movements are unknown. There were supposedly some remaining Imperial ships, but they had completely lost contact with them.

"Originally, they surrendered when their defeat was confirmed. That information should have reached the home country as well, but that is not the case."

"As for our own judgment, we are guessing that they were captured by the demon. It is possible that the enemy is not bound by the rules of humanity and therefore did not allow them to surrender, but..."

"I'm also curious about Kondou's words. Based on the expression that he was taken over, I wonder if the demons have a propensity to possess people. If so, the survivors are doomed."

Someone was assigned to bring back information. And yet we haven't heard from them. That explains the situation if they were all possessed by demons.

"There's nowhere to run, on the Great South Sea. Each country has approached their fleets, but they haven't responded. There's no reason to lie here, so I think it's safe to assume that our forces have been taken."

It's one of the possibilities, but if that's true, the situation was bad. Even mankind's greatest swordsman is no match for the enemy leader. Moreover, elite soldiers could be sacrificed to the enemy monsters. Moreover, the army won't be able to intercept them. There was nothing they could do. That's why Gensei and his team had decided to focus all their efforts on the defense of the Imperial Capital.

"It's only a matter of buying time. You understand that, don't you?"

"Of course. There's only one thing we can do now. I've sent people we trust to find out what the enemy is doing. And then we will gather the world's best forces to defeat the ringleader."

"I know it's a low success rate strategy, but it's the only way to go... If only Kondou-san could have defeated one of them, we would have been able to defeat them! Because there were two Mythical/Dragon-class players, they wouldn't even allow him to escape. So, if Master Araki, myself, plus Amari^[Text had あま り Ama -- Ri so I just went with Amari.] and all the other heroes from other countries teamed up, we might even be able to defeat the demon leader!"

The man named Amari Masahiko^[Text said 天(あま) 理(り) 正(まさ) 彦( ひこ). So Ama-Ri-Masa-Hiko? I could be wrong though because I'm not fluent in Japanese.] was the brother of Minamoto, who was the only one to compete with Kondou. Moreover, this man had mastered not only swordsmanship but also the art of law. He excelled in espionage and still works in secret missions. Moreover, there was another strongman hidden here in Hinomoto. Although Emperor Akira never talks about it, there were other 'Emperor Guardians' besides Gensei.

In addition, there are also famous heroes in each country. Not only those who had infiltrated the surface of society, there were also those who were in the 'Gai class' and even higher than the Mythical/Dragon class in the underworld. The famous ones are the aforementioned Mystery Monk Pulcinella of the north, and Fist Saint Xianhua of China. Just from the stories passed down in the Empire's own people, they know that these two men are extremely powerful.

To confront this global threat, these heroes must work together. If they can't do so, they will be destroyed. But that was also a pipe dream, as Akira was keenly aware. And that wasn't the only problem.

"The problem is that there are more than just two ringleaders of the enemy. And, as much as I hate to think about it..."

"You feel like there will be trouble if you go further, do you?"

"Exactly."

To Velgrynd's point, Gensei nodded bitterly. In order to defeat the monster of the Mythical/Dragon class, he wanted to double the number of warriors of the same class or higher. But with the size of the enemy unknown, it was impossible for the heroes of the world to assemble together. The Empire, too, must protect its own dignitaries as the first priority.

The problems kept piling up. It would be best if they could lure the monsters of the mythical/dragon class individually. Even if that was not possible, they still have to fight only the number of monsters they can win against. If they were outnumbered, then they would be defeated. However, this is when things changed. Gensei was puzzled, but Velgrynd helped him.

"Hmm, you've got problems. Okay. I'll help you, so show me what you've got."

"What? What do you mean by that?"

"If you don't know your enemy, you can't make a plan. In order to do that, I need to know how strong these demons are."

"What are you talking about?"

"It's simple. You said it yourself Gensei, if you are Kondou's master, then you must be more than equal in strength, right? I'm new to this world, so I don't know what the standard of strength is. As such, you're going to have to..."

"I see, I understand. Kondou and I are both better at this level of skill. I have profound secrets that I have yet to show you, and I have supreme secrets that should only be told to the head family. However, that man's conviction was admirable. His spirit was fierce and his determination to win was extraordinary. You must leave it to chance if you are serious about this."

In short, it's an even match. A little difference is an error for Velgrynd. It was good enough for the standard though, so she decided to try it out.

![hard scene break]

The location has changed... It's the training grounds. Gensei excused Minamoto from the room because he couldn't show his supreme inner secrets to him, so no one but the Emperor is here to witness the event.

Velgrynd remains poised and stares blankly at Gensei. Gensei shows slight hesitation, his favorite sword in hand. The silken robe doesn't impede her movements, but it is unsuitable for combat by all accounts. And it wasn't likely to have much defense. If Gensei were to make a serious move, it would be a deadly one. He was unlikely to win against the Velgrynd, but he thought it might hurt her. Gensei decided to ask Velgrynd.

"I want to ask you one question. I know this is rude, but are you sure you're serious? You may not be safe when you're dealing with the inner workings of our school."

Velgrynd understands that this is a question out of concern to her. She could have ignored it, but decided to reassure Gensei. There is also a speculation that that person will be able to demonstrate his abilities.

"That's nice of you. But don't be alarmed. Your weapon, the sword? It looks pretty old and good quality, but I'm afraid it doesn't work for me. So, don't worry about it, just come at me and give it your best shot."

In fact, Gensei's sword was only less than unique-grade in performance. In this world where magic was weak, swords could not evolve. Then Gensei responded to Velgrynd's challenge.

"Yeah!"

Concentrating his explosive fighting spirit, he unleashed the supreme profound effect of Oboro Shinmei-ryū, the Eightfold Sakura---the Eightfold Flower Flash. But alas, the flower did not bloom. The great technique was stopped by the tips of Velgrynd's fingers.

![full page image](image7)

A shapeshifting sword streak, but not a split. Even if it was too fast for an ordinary person to catch, it was too slow for Velgrynd.

"If you're serious about that, that's enough."

"Kuh, I'm here..."

It was too late to put it to rest with words like 'ability gap'. There was an insurmountable gap between Gensei and Velgrynd, between heaven and earth, or even more so. This result made it clear. Thus, in exchange for Gensei's disappointment, Velgrynd had obtained the correct information. Gensei's Eight Flowers, an art that had been passed down only to the original family, had never been taught to Kondou. There is no doubt that it is the greatest and most powerful weapon in this world. Therefore, it was thought that just by looking at the amount of power it possessed, it could surpass the Mythical/Dragon class and even reach the divine God/Buddha class.

"Are you really a god?"

"Although it was my brother who created the world, he's not a god."

"Well...in our perception, we call it a god."

"The concept of God is one that is perceived differently at different times and places. I don't care what you think, but you have to remember that there are some beings that can destroy me..."

Velgrynd was reminded of a laid-back slime. It's annoying to think that she lost to that thing, but there's no doubt in heer mind that she wouldn't win another fight.

*That doesn't make Rimuru a god, does it? I guess the bottom line is that his category doesn't exist, right?*

And then Velgrynd thought about it. Honestly, thinking about it won't give her an answer, so she switched her thinking immediately. What's important is the enemy of this world. It's about the demons.

"All right, thank you for your help. This made me realize how immature and small I am. I'll use this experience as an inspiration to work harder in the future."

Gensei just shrugs off such comments. And Velgrynd quickly put together a theory. Gensei and Kondou are roughly equal. However, his strength was far less powerful than Kondou's was when they first met. Most of the humans in the material world die from the dense concentrations of magical elements once they cross the world. But a few were reborn by remodeling, transforming their bodies into powerful beings. These were the otherworlders of Velgrynd's homeland.

*That's right, I've forgotten. This world is very low in magic. That's why it's harder to cast a spell, and the level physical strengthening is low. Their physical strength is innate, so it's rather amazing that they can even be this powerful.*

And so Velgrynd made her decision, remembering the shock she felt in her fingertips. Back home, it was as powerful as a rank A. She was impressed by what he can do with a rare-grade weapon. Now then, you can imagine the strength of the enemy.

*I guess the demon class is about B rank to A-minus rank. The Mythical/Dragon rank is about A-minus rank. If so, the demon must be a 'phantom-race'.*

The phantom-race is an Aggressor tribe, a half-mental life form. In the material world, it could only be active for a short time without incarnation. Particularly in this world where magic is scarce, its energy efficiency would have been too low if it had not possessed a human. Therefore, if it uses its true strength, its human body would not be able to withstand it.

*He's getting weaker. Well, this world isn't protected by magical elements, so if you use too much power, it might destroy it. If they're destroying it, or even invading it, do they control its power? That's probably why Kondou's current strength was so important in a fight.*

If the phantom-race is serious, then the inhabitants of this world don't stand a chance. Velgrynd concluded and smiled at her good fortune to be here now. Velgrynd was confident that with her, they could better manage to deal with the demon king Feldway, the leader of the phantom race. However, it was unlikely that Feldway would be sent to this invading region, so that concern was unnecessary.

In fact, it was just as Velgrynd had predicted. The men who were invading this world were an advance force of monsters under Cornu's command. Also, the size of the Underworld Gate that spontaneously appeared in this world was so small that it was impossible for Cornu's main body to appear. It was currently in the process of expansion, giving them a little more time to take over the world. She hadn't been able to see that accurately, but it was enough for Velgrynd.

![soft scene break]

Gensei appears to be maintaining a sense of normalcy, but he is actually depressed. Naturally. It was as if his swordplay, which he believed to be the strongest, was completely useless against Velgrynd. Even his secret techniques couldn't reach her. Even though he understood that they were on different levels, it was difficult to convince his emotions. Even so, Gensei used his well-honed mental strength to keep his mind from being disturbed. Velgrynd smiles at Gensei.

"You should be proud of yourself. In a world where there is little to no magic, few people can reach that level of strength. If you could have taken in some magic element and sublimated your body, you could have become not only an Immortal but a Saint. It's too bad about that."

"A Saint, that's a far cry for me."

"Not really, but yes. I'm going to reward you for helping me. Can you accept it?"

"A reward?"

"Yes. If you want, I'll reforge your sword with my power."

Velgrynd smiles at that. She could use 'Matter Creation' to create a mythical-grade weapon. In this case, she had poured magic into Gensei's sword, hoping to encourage its evolution.

"You don't mean that..."

*Is it possible?*

Gensei was confused, but then reminded himself that it was too late. Gensei was convinced that the Velgrynd was a heavenly being beyond his comprehension, and that if she said she could do it, then she could do it.

*An ancestral heirloom...it would be fun to trust Velgrynd-dono with it.*

With that resolve, Gensei bowed to Velgrynd and held out his beloved sword.

"Please..."

"Yes, let me take care of that."

Velgrynd nodded widely and accepted the sword. Normally, she would casually create a blue dragon sword, but this time was different. Carefully, she assessed the composition of the sword and poured her magical elements into it, making delicate adjustments. Velgrynd's work continues with a more serious expression than the one she had in battle. Then, about thirty minutes passed. With an old blacksmith's skillful technique and the magic that Velgrynd controlled completely, together, they gave the sword a mythical glow.

"Finished."

It was a weapon evolution that would normally take hundreds to thousands of years, but in such a short time, Velgrynd had forged Gensei's beloved sword into a mythical-grade sword.

"Th-this is?!"

"This is the best weapon in the world now, isn't it? Even so, you can't possibly use it right now... Still, the sword has a will. If the sword approves, it will help you a bit. I don't know if that will be you, or one of your descendants"

Velgrynd laughed. The smile was so beautiful that it bewitched Gensei's heart.

![hard scene break]

The time was now evening. It was time to eat, so Akira went back to his room. Velgrynd was also invited to join. Since she was here, she decided to join. The maids of the palace are handpicked from a carefully selected group. They are well-trained and unaffected by anything. They prepared the meal as if it were a matter of course, without batting an eyelash at the sight of the Velgrynd. Minamoto is on guard duty outside the door, while Gensei stands behind Akira Sakura and waits. Only the two of them will take their seats.

"So, what do you plan to do now?"

"I will be by your side, and I'll protect you."

"I'm glad to hear that, but can I assume that you'll be on my side?"

"Yes, you're right."

Velgrynd smiles in reply and is happy just to be by Rudra's side. Confused by this Velgrynd, Akira Sakura asks

"Huhu, then you will eliminate conflict from this world and reassure me?"

Of course, that was a joke. And yet Velgrynd laughed and replied.

"All right."

"If you want, I can give you this world. We'll wipe out the countries you don't want and silence the ones who complain. But first, we have to destroy the demons that are in our way."

Everyone in the room was stunned to see Velgrynd answer with a very innocent smile. Even the maidservant who was on duty unintentionally spilled some of the soup. They all knew in their guts that she meant what she said. That doesn't mean it's true, or that it's a big deal. The words would be laughed off if someone else had said them. But there was something about Velgrynd that made it so. And Gensei and others who know the essence of Velgrynd know it's not a joke and that it's possible. The same was true for Akira Sakura.

"Hahaha, I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. You've done well to joke around so much that the maidservants take you seriously. Your joke was amusing, but I'll just take it as a compliment."

They managed to cover up the situation. It was clear now that Velgrynd was not an ordinary being, as the conversation at dinner made clear. Not only is she strong, but her train of thought is tricky. Akira finally understood that she would do anything for him. If she was ordered to destroy another country, Velgrynd would do it. To her, right and wrong were of secondary importance, and only Sakura's will was what mattered.

To be honest, this was the first time in his life that Akira was so confused. He had been born as the next Emperor of the Empire and had lived a life of ease. But he didn't have freedom either, he was taught from an early age that it was the duty of a king. He had everything he needed, but he had to give up what he really wanted. Love was an illusion and he had the duke's daughter as his wife to back him up. It was like a contract and he couldn't refuse her. The wise Akira knew it before he became a young man. Transience is the truth. The world is like a dream.

Because it is fleeting, you can strive to make your dreams come true with all your might.

On the other hand, it is beautiful to surrender to fate and accumulate the small amount of happiness that exists in those days. It was the latter that Akira Sakura chose. To do what you love is a luxury that never comes true, even for the Emperor who has everything. It was precisely because of such an Akira, that Velgrynd was a surprise to him. That freedom will not be bound by any man. And yet she is beholden to only one person, Akira. A strange woman. No, a goddess. Even if he was acting as Rudra, a simple favor is always better than a simple one. Feeling this way, Akira Sakura enjoyed a peaceful dinner for the first time in a long time.

![hard scene break]

It is now next morning after dawn. Today there will be a meeting by the Imperial Headquarters. The issue here is how to handle Velgrynd. As Akira declared, acting like a lover in front of a third party is strictly forbidden. So, it was necessary to figure out how to explain Velgrynd's status first. Then there was the question of clothing. Exotic clothing is out of the question. One had to dress appropriately for their status. While all the best maids gathered to arrange the various costumes, Akira Sakura, with input from Gensei and Minamoto, pondered the question of Velgrynd's status.

"As for the maid..."

"A lady-in-waiting can't attend a meeting, you fool."

Minamoto's idea is dismissed by Gensei before he can finish.

"The escort is going to be difficult too."

"Your Majesty, I've considered that, but Velgrynd-dono's appearance is too eye-catching. By all appearances, she is a foreigner, so she will be suspected of being a spy."

If she was Japanese, they wouldn't have to worry about it so much. But Velgrynd was too beautiful and seemingly of northern European descent to stand out in this country. Even if he wants to introduce her as a bodyguard or a spy, they'd be asked why they are using foreigners so heavily. That said, Velgrynd won't be happy if he asks her to stay at home. Besides, it was a shame to let Velgrynd's forces go to waste when she was supposed to be on their side. Just when he was wondering what to do, Velgrynd herself voiced her opinion.

"It can't be helped. I don't really like it, and I don't want to, but I'm going to change my look. Is that okay?"

And with that, Velgrynd's appearance changes. Dark hair and dark eyes. Her skin had become a pale yellow with just a hint of red.

![full page image](image8)

"Wow, you can even do tricks like that!"

Minamoto was impressed with the tone of voice that was unexpected, and Gensei agreed that it wasn't that strange.

"I guess I didn't have to worry about it."

And Akira Sakura was slightly distracted. Just by changing the arrangement of the coloring, the impression was very different. Although this still made her look less Japanese, it was not too much of a distraction. The uniform given to Velgrynd was the same as Gensei's. In order to attend the meeting, Akira Sakura had assigned her 'Personal Guard'.^[The word used is "Konoe" (近衛) which can mean near/personal guard, close defender, imperial guard, etc.]

Incidentally, the Emperor's Guard consists of three organizations. The first is the Imperial Guard Swordsman Corps. It is the only unit in the palace that is allowed to be armed. However, only the captain, Minamoto, is allowed to enter the Emperor's quarters. The second is the Imperial Palace Guards. This unit magically protected the Emperor from magic and witchcraft. They maintained a spiritual guardian barrier and were inferior to the swordsmen in terms of individual combat ability alone. Only the captain has access to the Emperor, but he has been so busy defending the capital that he hasn't been seen in the past few days. And the last organization was the Personal Guard, an individual group called the 'Emperor's Guardians'.

Not all of them, like Gensei, were well known to the public. There were those who lurked in the shadows, warding off evil. Those who had harbored supernatural powers. Those who have split from the imperial family so that they can play the part of the Emperor's shadow warriors. These men of many purposes served in the shadows, guarding the Emperor. No wonder no one knew who they were. So now Akira decided to give Velgrynd a position as Emperor's Guardians'.

"Velgrynd, I will appoint you as a 'Guardian of the Emperor'. With that title, it shall spare you the trouble of explaining to the others."

"I accept. Then I will behave like a proper vessel in front of the others."

Velgrynd, who wore a military uniform, replied flirtatiously. Everyone was worried about the situation, but there was no other plan. Even if something went wrong, it was nothing compared to the invaders, the demons. Under this judgment, preparations were being made.

![hard scene break]

One by one, people began to gather in the main conference hall. Akira was watching them from the waiting room. The Imperial Headquarters is the supreme commanding body that reports directly to Emperor. It is the army of the Emperor and is composed of both a Navy and an Army. At the top of both camps are the Minister of the Navy and the Minister of the Army.

Both ministers were required to attend the Imperial General Meeting. Substitutes are allowed, but they are rarely present as it is considered a disrespect for the Emperor. As is customary in the past few days, most of the contents of the meeting are now reported. In the Great South Sea, the Imperial Navy was soundly defeated. Even the whereabouts of survivors are unknown, and each camp is pulling out all the stops to investigate. The army, however, seemed to be someone else's problem. They make excuses because they don't have the means to go to the sea, but Akira Sakura thinks that's because they don't really understand the threat.

*You idiots. Now is not the time for our people to be competing with each other for credit.*

But the Emperor is someone who cannot say that. Because his authority is too great, his words are too heavy. If it was in private that would be one thing, but in public, he has to be careful of what he says. Unaware of Akira Sakura's anguish, an officer in the army calls out,

"Who are you?! Who do you think you are?! This sacred headquarters is an outrageous place for a woman to enter!"

"Oh, so I knew it was going to be like that..." said Sakura Akira.

Those whose only have inflated pride are bothered by hierarchy and etiquette. So it was natural for this to happen, but if Akira Sakura had accompanied here, there would be more of a fuss. Since they all agreed on this, Gensei was given the responsibility for Velgrynd.

*As I suspected, a man with a lot of blood on his hands is making things difficult. If he should offend her, he would not only destroy himself, but this city as well.*

Letting out a big sigh, Akira Sakura let out a big sigh. Perhaps it was the fate of those with Rudra's soul to be pushed around by Velgrynd.

"Could you be talking to me?"

"Can't you even understand that, you fool?! This is why---Mogaa!"

Suddenly, the officer's ranting stopped. It was because Velgrynd had grabbed the man's chest in an unnoticeable move and plunged her pistol into his open mouth. With a thin smile, Velgrynd says

"I don't think it would have mattered whether you were a man or a woman in this day and age, when you could kill someone by pulling the trigger, if you fought with a sword or a spear in the olden days. What is important in today's warfare is the ability to analyze the situation and to make a calm and rational decision without emotion. You don't deserve to be here. I wonder if you are not qualified to be here, screaming like that?"

To begin with, he was no match for force, but seeing the violence of a gun, which anyone can understand, caused a commotion among the people in the hall.

"Keh, you! Let go of the Chief of Staff!"

"You can't have guns in here! Guards, someone call the guards!"

Velgrynd laughs mockingly.

"Silly you, fussing over a single toy! How can you be considered a glorious soldier of the Empire for that?"

Many faces turned red when they heard that, and many people looked at her angrily. Regardless, Velgrynd shoved the chief of staff aside. Then she pointed her toy gun and pulled the trigger. A stream of water spurted out, wetting the Chief of Staff's crotch.

"Ufufu. It looks like you just wet your pants. Why don't you go home and change?"

"You, you sly..."

He was shaking with humiliation, but as soon as he looked into Velgrynd's eyes, he gulped down his words. It was a horrifying stare.

'I will kill you if you make any more noise unceremoniously...' the Chief of Staff felt as if he was being told that, and all at once the blood drained from his veins.

"Hahaha, excuse me. I guess I got a little too excited myself. I do miss the water pistol. I felt like a child again, and my head was cold."

"Well, that's good to hear. If you're going to be in the meeting, you're going to have to behave yourself a little better."

The Chief of Staff nodded coyly. He was short-tempered and a bit arrogant, but he was no fool. He had failed in their first encounter, but he hadn't made a mistake in his subsequent responses. If he had still growled at her, he would have had a heart attack from Velgrynd's fury. Rudra is the only thing that matters to Velgrynd. She was not amused by the idea of an incompetent man serving Rudra. So she tried to get rid of the incompetence, but she was just a little pending on the Chief of Staff's punishment. Just because he was short-tempered and misogynistic was not enough of a reason to eliminate him.

*Phew, I'm getting nicer. Maybe it's because I've been through so much on this trip.*

And so on and so forth, Velgrynd praises herself. Needless to say, it was an overestimate. She was just happy that Rudra is with her, otherwise the result would have been different. Each time she leapt for the pieces of his soul, there were times when she couldn't find her next goal. In such cases, she had to wait for the reincarnation of Rudra to be born, which could take years or decades.

For Velgrynd, that time after seeing her loved ones off was like torture. In her own mind, a man's fate was sealed if he came under her influence at such a time. The Chief of Staff had been lucky. When the scene had calmed down, the naval minister spoke up to change things up.

"So, Araki-dono. And who is this woman?"

The naval general looks at Gensei with a commanding gaze. He's in his fifties. Gensei also got in a word.

"Excuse me, I'm sorry I'm late in the introductions. She is a colleague of mine, and it has been decided that she will attend the Imperial Council meeting today, by permission of His Majesty."

"My name is 'Ryuo.' Please to make your acquaintance." Interrupting Gensei's introduction, Velgrynd nonchalantly took a false name. The name was a random combination of the character for dragon from 'True Dragon' and the character for phoenix from the divine beast that controlled the flame in this world---Ryuo (the phoenix).^["Ryuo." - She uses a pseudonym that combines '竜' from 'dragon' (pronounced Ryū in japanese) and '凰' meaning 'phoenix.'] However, that was a big problem.

"Wait, phoenix for dragon?"

"Taking a dragon for a name is insolent. This is really insulting to the Emperor!"

"Or are you related to Your Majesty by any chance?"

They had calmed down now but there was now a great deal of confusion. Gensei regrets his mistake.

*Did she do this on purpose? No, no. Velgrynd-dono doesn't care what we do. Since she even disguised herself, we should have considered a pseudonym...*

It was his fault, Gensei reflected. Akira also let out a sigh in the other room. I've lived a long time, but this is the first time I've been pushed around this much. That's why I'm somewhat amused. Akira stood up and stepped into the chamber.

"This is a critical time. Isn't it strange to be disclosing our hand?"

He chuckled as he said this before those who noticed him stood up and hung their heads. Now that the lord had told them so, they have no choice but to accept it. Even if they had a complaint, they could not say it openly. Thus, Velgrynd in this world came to be known as Ryuo.

![soft scene break]

"Let's get started."

With a word from Akira Sakura, the main conference began.

"Then I will give the report."

That said, it was a naval intelligence officer who stood up. The last few days had been pretty much the same, but today was different.

"The enemy coalition fleet has made a port call at Atlantis."

"Are you sure?"

"Yes, sir. The call came from a local intelligence officer, so there's no doubt about it."

"It's still the largest military port among the several supply areas, you know. But how can you be sure it's not a deception?"

"As you say. There are several archipelagos in the Great South Sea. There was also a report that Azalea is setting up a secret base there. Have you sent agents there as well?"

The general asks, and the Minister of the Navy follows suit. The intelligence officer answers those questions without hesitation.

"There are too many of them to reach all the islands, sir. However, the number of enemy ships remaining in port at Atlantis matches the information we received prior to our sortie, and the possibility of a separate fleet has been eliminated. An Imperial Navy warship has been captured. They're planning to stay here and work on their maintenance, to frustrate our will to fight."

The Imperial Navy's crushing defeat was already known to the Imperial Headquarters. So no one is surprised now, but they can't keep quiet when they hear that their ship has been captured.

"The enemy's movements were superimposed. And, um, have any of our ships succeeded in escaping?"

"No, of course not. If there was, they would have contacted us long ago."

The surprisingly brazen Chief of Staff pointed out. He seems to have cooled off, as he said he would, and his point is accurate.

"As you say, Mr. Chief of Staff, I believe it is safe to assume that every ship in our fleet has been captured."

"Tch! Then it's as if we've already increased the enemy's strength!"

"It can't be helped. We were dealing with an unknown enemy, a demon. Even if it were me in the room, the result would have been the same."

The Chief refutes the Army Minister's statement.

"Excuse me. I didn't mean to insult the Navy. It's just that I'm frustrated..."

"I accept your apology. We all have the same regrets."

The meeting was tense. They are in the tightest situation since the beginning of the Empire's history. The Imperial Fleet, which had prided itself on being the strongest in the world, had been defeated. Moreover, many ships, including the most advanced ones, have fallen into the hands of the enemy. Everyone was anxious and worried about the unprecedented danger. There was no point in complaining, but even a whine would still pop out. If the commander-in-chief hadn't acted like a grown-up, the situation would have been even bleaker. In a slightly relaxed atmosphere, Akira Sakura, not missing the opportunity, opens his mouth.

"So, are our soldiers still being held as prisoners of war?"

That question makes the naval participants tense. The safety of their comrades, their loved ones, is a cause for concern. Of course, they were important to the army as well, a matter of great importance to their comrades and also of great consequence for their future plans. If this were a normal war, the wartime agreement would have guaranteed the safety of the prisoners of war. But this time, that premise could be undermined by the involvement of an unknown invader. If it was the same as before, fine. If it wasn't...

His gaze fell on the intelligence officer.

"That is..."

"What's the matter? Get on with your answer!"

The stagnant intelligence officer stammered, but was urged by his superior officer to continue.

"According to eyewitness reports, a group of Imperial Navy generals were steering the captured vessel with their own hands. There were also enemy soldiers on board, but they were in very small numbers. There was no sign of gunfire, and it appeared as if they had turned over of their own volition."

It was natural to stammer, everyone thought. And the same was true of Akira. A proud soldier of the Imperial Guard would never abandon his duties so easily. And moreover, it was unthinkable that he would turn over to the enemy.

"That wouldn't make Kondou-san, who risked his life for it, any happier..."

Minamoto's murmurings echoed through the silent chamber.

'It is better to believe in the possibility of being controlled by a demon.' That is the true feelings of everyone present. And Velgrynd cheerfully affirms that thought.

"Hmmm, silly. Don't worry. None of your friends are going to betray you."

It was Velgrynd. The naval officers could not believe that their comrades had betrayed them, and they were puzzled by the circumstantial evidence that suggested it. That's why they found hope in Velgrynd's statement.

"What do you mean by that, Ryuo-dono?"

The Minister of the Navy asks on behalf of everyone. Velgrynd smiled and replied.

"It's simple. Demons have the ability to possess people. They're new and don't have much power in our world, but by possessing people and taking their bodies, they can slowly become more and more powerful. They don't have much magic element as a source of power, and it will take some time for them to fully assimilate, don't you think?"

That was exactly the hope.

"I see. So they're being controlled after all!"

"If it takes so long to assimilate, does that mean we can help them now?"

"We can't allow them to mock our friends! We will destroy you, demons!"

"We must immediately launch a rescue mission---"

"Wait a minute, things aren't that easy."

The chamber was in an uproar. Some wondered how she knew so much about it, but then they reminded themselves that it was no surprise when she was Emperor's trump card, and they accepted her word with open arms. Then they all agreed on rescuing their comrades, but then they remembered that it was a conundrum and regained their composure. To begin with, the empire has just lost the war for its own survival. A rescue mission is not something that comes easily to mind.

First of all, there weren't enough ships left in the kingdom. Six aircraft carriers. Four battleships. Four heavy cruiser ships. Two light cruiser ships. Eighteen destroyer ships.

After losing so many ships, even if they could gather them from all over the Empire, they could only gather less than half of these ships. They would only need to assemble a single fleet. If they were sent to rescue everyone, then the defense of the mainland would become a challenge.

"But the world's leaders are aware of the current situation. Shouldn't we make peace in secret and concentrate on the true enemy, the phantoms?"

"Everyone knows that. This is impossible with the army in its grasp."

"Other countries are not happy, but they are the same as us. We have not been able to keep track of the army troops we have sent to China."

"And more importantly, we've just been robbed of our decisive force..."

Even if the leadership had made peace, it wouldn't have solved anything. There's no way to announce an end to the war if the military is still out of control. Therefore, the first step in resolving the situation is to deal with the demon. Before that, there was a concern that everyone was aware of, but couldn't say anything about. What was it?

"Is there anyone here in possession of the demon?"

It was the Minister of War who finally uttered it. From the way he stared at the naval participants, it was obvious what he was thinking.

"Huh! Do you doubt us?"

"No, no, I don't think that's what I said. But from what you've just told me, I'm sure you can't blame me for suspecting it."

"Don't be ridiculous! If you say that, then so does the army, they're running amok in China!"

"Nuh-uh, that's..."

The atmosphere in the chamber was almost engulfed in a terrible atmosphere, but it was interrupted by Akira Sakura.

"The good news is that our brave soldiers are safe. It is only natural that we should rescue them, but can we really achieve this by squabbling here? I'm sure you know the right answer, brave men."

" "Yes, Your Majesty! I beg your pardon!" "

With those words, everyone became calm. It's a very dignified thing to say, but for Akira, he still felt like he was walking a tightrope. Simply being upset won't solve the situation, so there is no choice here but to strongly rebuke. He can understand the anxiety of the officers, but Akira Sakura also felt frustrated at his inability to do anything.

"Ryuo-dono, I understand the War Minister's concern, but are you able to distinguish between humans and demons?"

It was Gensei who asked this question. If they couldn't tell friend from foe apart, then they couldn't talk about anything. That's the premise for all of their countermeasures. It was quiet again in the chamber as everyone waited for Velgrynd's answer.

"There's no way any of them are. If there were, I would have told you first."

Everyone was relieved to hear that.

"Yes, that's right."

The same was true for Gensei. If a demon of the heavenly demon class had transformed into a human being, there was a chance they couldn't tell them apart. If even Velgrynd here couldn't do it, then there would have been nothing left to do but give up.

'There was still hope,' Gensei felt. But Velgrynd was different.

"I'm surprised. Can't you even tell if you're one of them or not? Demons, I call them phantoms, but they possess people because they have to. So that they can live in this world. And once they've fully assimilated, they can no longer be considered human."

If assimilation isn't complete, the 'Barrier' guarding this imperial city should be enough to see through it. They may be able to transform into humans, but their very nature is foreign. It's because of such instability that they won't go out until stable, Velgrynd explained.

"And you see, the lowest-ranking 'grunts' are wise, but not self-aware. They're small fry who follow orders from their superiors, so you can figure them out with a quick questioning."

The memory of a possessed person can be read, but it is only the surface level. If you ask about the deeper parts, they will not be able to answer and will get messed up. When Velgrynd explained this, the mood in the chamber was one of relief. The explanation continued further. It was until this time that the meeting was serious. From this point forward, Velgrynd was on her own.

"Since you don't seem to know anything about it, I have to tell you that there is a definite hierarchy of ranks among the phantoms. That 'soldier' you just mentioned is a small fry. And since they're only one level of strength away from being fully assimilated, they're only as strong as the most advanced demon (youkai)."

It's easy to say that it's an advanced demon, but it's a level of danger that requires a task force. However, the Velgrynd could not care less.

"R-Ryuo-dono, does that mean that if they fully assimilate, this 'soldier' will become a heavenly-class demon?"

The Minister of the Army asked, to which Velgrynd replied firmly.

"Clever man, you're right."

"Huh?!"

The Army Minister's exclamation wasn't because he felt ridiculed. He was speechless at the desperate situation of the lowest-ranked soldiers being the equivalent of the Heavenly Demon class. The temperature difference between him and Velgrynd was so great that it was pitiful. There was no one here who could laugh at the Army Minister. They all felt the same way.

"Why are you surprised? If that was the case, even Gensei can beat it. If you're a 'commander class' who commands a group of soldiers, they may have a hard time, but they can't beat him."

The lower-ranked 'commander' class is equivalent to the A rank in strength in the other world---but until their possession is complete, they are only slightly stronger than the B rank. Once it was fully assimilated into the mythical/dragon class, it would be an inevitable struggle. But even so, Velgrynd decided that Gensei would be enough to defeat it.

"It pains me to say this," he said, "but against two of them, even Kondou lost. I don't want you to get your hopes up."

"You shouldn't be so weak. Kondou stuck to his beliefs until the end, you know."

That reminds Gensei. He realized that he had been weak. Then, he realized how blind he had been. He could feel the heat of the sword at his side. That primed Gensei to regain his confidence.

"Yes, you're right. If we act weak, we will lose battles that could have been won."

"Right. Well, if you're feeling weak, I'm here, so there's no way you can lose."

It was Velgrynd who ruined Gensei's resolve.

![soft scene break]

Just like that, the flow of the main conference has changed. Velgrynd's explanation continued.

"The higher up they are, the stronger they are, but their energy is too high for them to come into our world. Maybe they're only here now up to the lower echelon, the 'general' level. So..."

"Wait, wait, wait!"

"What is it?"

The explanation was interrupted, and Velgrynd grimaced. Had it not been in front of Akira Sakura, she wouldn't have forgiven anyone for interrupting her.

"Well, the ranks of the phantom, are we to assume that they are the same as those of the military?"

"Are you doubting my language skills?"

"No, I don't mean to, but it does raise the question of whether there is a 'lieutenant' or 'colonel' rank between 'commander' and 'general'..."

It was the Minister of the Navy who heard about it, but this was on everyone's mind as well. It may be insignificant to Velgrynd, but to the inhabitants of this world, they are a desperate opponent.

"If Gensei-dono is going to have a hard time, would the 'commander' class be the equivalent of a mythical/dragon demon?"

"Yes, I think that's the same opponent that Kondou lost to, so it's almost certainly true."

"Then how strong is a 'general'?"

He's as strong as a mythical/dragon class or even a god/buddha class. Since it cannot be beat by humans, it is classified as a god/buddha class. If such an opponent attacked, any resistance was meaningless. One by one, their faces grew pale as they realized this.

"So perhaps Kondou had been defeated by this 'general.'

"Maybe so, but I'm not interested. I don't care either way."

It doesn't matter who you lose to, Velgrynd doesn't care. All that mattered was the fact that you had lost.

"Oh yeah, and since I remember, I should tell you that there are only two ways for a phantom to appear in this world. Either you go through the Underworld Gate, or you're summoned by a superior. I'm guessing he was summoned because there would be no 'gate' at sea."

"The General could have called in more than 10,000 of them", Velgrynd said in a light-hearted tone.

To the listeners' point of view, it was a hopeless number. Everyone could only stare at the Velgrynd in awe.

"Would Ryuo-dono, I mean, can you win?"

'That was the only hope,' the Minister of the Navy asked.

*That's a ridiculous question*, he thought to himself and started laughing. Even against an enemy general-level unit, this enemy would be powerful enough to destroy mankind. And now that it leads its subordinates, there is nothing they can do about it. No matter how strong the mysterious woman who called herself Ryuo was, there was no way she could take on the Legion individually.

"Isn't the opponent an army of god class with unimaginable power? In all times and places, we have only heard of stories of man's victory over the gods in myths..."

"Isn't there no choice but to pray that the world will not be destroyed?"

The Chief of Staff and the Army Minister felt the same way as the Navy Minister, and so they followed suit. Velgrynd snickered.

"Silly you. If anyone could beat me, it would be only Feldway, the king of the phantoms, wouldn't it? But I don't intend to lose, and he won't be able to manifest himself over here."

Why do you know the name of the enemy king---and so many other questions. But no one was there to point them out. It occurred to them that this woman should be no different. There was one thing they had to make sure of.

"I don't doubt that you are strong, Ryuo-sama. So I would like to ask you..."

It was the inspectorate general of education who had been silent the whole time and had watched the proceedings with great courage. He was one of the three Secretaries of the Army and a mediator in the event of a conflict. Velgrynd turned to the inspectorate general.

"What is it?"

"This country is on the verge of extinction, so will you then go out and take on the enemy?"

"No, I will not. Because I have only one life left."

Of course, that was a lie. With her 'Parallel Existence,' it is possible to defeat the enemy while protecting the Emperor. But there's no reason to tell them that. Velgrynd used her identity as the 'Guardian of the Emperor' as a shield and declared that she would devote herself to his protection. For one reason only. It's a calculated decision.

One cannot grow further if they only look to others for help in times of trouble. She doesn't think a country like that would have a future anyway. If that was the case, then it would be the same even if everyone died here. Velgrynd is affectionate and has not yet abandoned this country, or mankind. If this were Velzard, she would not have let those with such a feeble mind live. Before she set out on her journey, she would have thought that she would take care of everything until Rudra died, but anything after that was of no concern to Velgrynd. But now she can see the bigger picture. This, too, was a change that came about because of her encounter with Rimuru and his perspective.

All that mattered to Velgrynd now was Rudra and his beloved people. And to protect the bloodline that goes on and on. That's why, as always, she makes sure that the people left behind will be able to do something when she's gone. The words are harsh, but Velgrynd declares that she will not move out.

"But don't worry. Your Majesty will be safe with me. So I suggest you do the best you can."

In short, it was a matter of showing some guts.

![soft scene break]

Now that the strength of the enemy is known, the direction of the Congress will be shifted to future measures. With Velgrynd's help, the Emperor's safety was assured. The officers in the main camp are not stupid and they understand what Velgrynd is saying. That's why they decided to take care of it themselves first.

"Then keep a strict eye on the movements of the enemy fleet."

"Yes, sir. I'll double and triple my hands and give orders not to miss the movement."

"How much time do we have before the demon possesses a person and completely assimilates with them?"

"Well, if there are a lot of demons, it won't take more than a week, but over here, I think it'll take at least two months."

In front of Rudra, Velgrynd also answers honestly without hiding what is asked. As a result, the policy was set without hesitation.

"It will take at least a month for the enemy fleet to finish replenishment and maintenance and leave port. The timing is consistent, so can we assume that the enemy won't move until a month from now?"

"I'm not so sure about that. It may take some time to re-organize our freshly captured fleet, but with both the Azalea and Chinese fleets now in operation, wouldn't it be possible to launch them with just a refueling run?"

"If that's the case, then it would be less than two weeks from Atlantis to the Empire. It'll depend on the weather, but..."

"It won't be done. Weather control is so basic, so think of it as sailing at maximum ship speed."

"Huh... Yes!"

By this time, the officers had begun to grasp Velgrynd's personality. Although she had an arrogant attitude, she had a surprisingly caring side to her. She answers questions seriously and will give advice. She's a great ally. If there is no way to take advantage of it, the talented ones will ask questions everywhere. And as a result, they had developed a general plan of attack.

"Oh. We could intercept them on the mainland, but that would make it impossible for us to rescue our brave brothers and sisters who are being held captive. Perhaps we should strike out and destroy the enemy ringleaders."

"That's right. I agree with you, but there is the question of who should go."

"If Ryuo-dono is protecting His Majesty, there will be no hindsight. I'll come with you."

"Oh, if Araki-dono will join us, it's a good thing."

"The entire swordsmanship squad, please join us!"

"Minamoto-kun, I'm counting on you!"

And so it seemed that the conversation was settled. That's when Velgrynd interrupted.

"...Are you guys serious? Or are you just having suicidal thoughts?"

"What do you mean?"

The Army Minister looked at Velgrynd with a shine in his eye. He had hoped that maybe she would join them, but that was too sweet an idea.

"I'll give you credit for showing that you are willing to work hard on your own, but that's not enough. The enemy is powerful, so we have make sure to do our best."

Most of them thought, *What are you talking about?* but some of them figured out the answer. One of them was the army's Chief of Staff.

"Am I to understand that we need more than our own country?"

This was surprising to Velgrynd. He had been the first one to turn on her, so she was under the impression he was more impulsive.

*Good thing I didn't give up on him too soon.*

Velgrynd nodded, disguising her true feelings.

"It is true that this is not the time to see this global crisis as an opportunity for nations to fight each other. We understand that, but as I have just explained, our military is in overdrive."

The army chief of staff says that he is frustrated too. But then Minamoto says,

"As I thought, we should also get cooperation from other countries! If we're only half-hearted, we'll be defeated and possessed by demons. That's why we're taking on the challenge with only our own elite troops, so we have no choice but to ask other countries to send their elite troops as well."

Hearing that, the others agree.

"It's the only way to go. This isn't a war anymore. We're locked in a race for survival against monsters, so this is no time to choose our bets. Before the outcome of the war, we must drive the demon out first."

"Right. This isn't just an imperial matter anymore."

"That's right. We should contact you as soon as possible and keep in step."

Just because it was the only way, he expressed his opinion.

"Correct. You guys are weak, and you need to use your brains more."

Hearing this, Velgrynd smiled with satisfaction and replied. But from the office's point of view, it was an absurd story.

"Please wait! I'm sure the world leaders understand that things aren't going well. But that doesn't mean they'll join hands and cooperate."

"Hmm, that would be difficult. No country is going to nod yes to an offer of a ceasefire out of the blue."

"We don't want that kind of suggestion in our country, do we?"

Those are very sensible opinions. Anything happens during the ceasefire is a disaster. For that to be possible, they need to at least get control of the military, which is out of control. Besides, there are many other problems. Even the popular opinion of the people won't be convinced. Some countries might use this as an opportunity to plot. The doubts were endless. Some argued that they could not move forward with suspicion, but if those fears are not cleared, then it is impossible to go hand in hand. There is no such thing as a partnership in this situation, but Velgrynd smiled and said,

"Will you give up without trying? Well, that's okay, then. I'll protect His Majesty and this Imperial City, His Majesty's home."

When she says that like he's a fool, the diplomatic officer has no choice but to retort.

"Okay. Then I'll try to contact them. Let's show our utmost sincerity and at least arrange for a meeting!"

Although he was close to retorting, he was still successful in meeting Velgrynd's challenge.

"That's right. Either way, we must do it, or we will perish."

"It may destroy me if I try, but I'd like to show my determination anyway."

"That's right. Even if we lose, we're going to have to fight back with everything we've got."

"I'm sorry for my people and my family, but..."

"It can't be helped. I don't care if they're under agreement, the enemy is a demon. It's a race for survival. A loss means the end for our nation. We must do all we can right now or we'll regret it."

And all the officers were well agitated. Velgrynd is happy to have it her way.

*That's fine. Act before you argue about whether or not you can do it. And if you make a mistake, I'll do something about it.*

She whispered the words in her heart and smiled. Everyone knew what to do and acted accordingly. Thus began the last stand of the empire.

![hard scene break]

Atlantis continent. It is the smallest continent located at the eastern end of the United States of Azalea. The climate is of a tropical rainforest. Most of it was heavily forested and jungle-like. But this continent had a more significant characteristic. There were iron ore mines and oil-producing wells. By harnessing its rich reserves, it had become the largest military base in Azalea's sphere of influence. And that was the beginning of the misfortune.

There was an ancient ruin near the military base, but unluckily, there was also an 'Underworld Gate' that led to the other world. Long ago, there was a ceremony performed by the native tribes. They may have attempted to communicate with the gods, but as a result, a small rupture in space-time occurred. It was discovered by a phantom race and is now firmly anchored as a stable Underworld Gate. The phantoms welcomed the indigenous Azalean people as their new targets for possession. They stole the military facilities they had built and used them as a foothold for their invasion.

A man in a reddish-brown military uniform in the national defense guard, commanded a multitude of men of various races. His black hair was brushed back. His thin, narrow eyes gleamed intelligently behind his glasses. He is Cornu's second in command from the heavenly realm. Before he mutated and became a phantom, he was active as a cherub. He didn't have a name, but he now calls himself Amari Masahiko. It was the name of the man whose body he incarnated when he appeared in this world.

Incidentally, the three phantom leaders may name their subordinates after themselves. Cornu didn't value the bond between the demons and their followers, which is why the demons in Cornu's group didn't have names. Race was of no concern to the Phantoms, but Amari Masahiko was Japanese. He was an agent who had come to explore Azalea's military facilities and was a rival to Kondou. He was a brilliant but unlucky man. There was no news of Kondou's defeat, and by the time he learned of the enemy's full extent, it was too late. He was outnumbered and defeated, and his body was taken over.

The body of Masahiko was strengthened by the 'Ki Fighting Method (Battlewill)' and was the best material for a phantom to use. More than a hundred days had passed since his manifestation, and the senior-ranked, second-in-command, had become fully capable of exerting his power even in this world. His unparalleled power could reach 10 million EP. This was the result of his own knowledge and skill level, and his power had increased greatly.

"Hurry up with the expansion work. The gate is too small for Cornu-sama to descend."

Originally, only those who had a magicule amount less than the size of the 'Underworld Gate' could fully manifest from the Otherworld. Those who did not had to leave their main body in the Otherworld and send out 'split bodies' linked by a 'Soul Corridor' to gradually regain their power. But...

The only ones who do not apply to this description are the Three Demons^[San (three) Youkai (demons)]. The power of the three demons is so great that an Underworld Gate wouldn't do them justice. It must be at least a million-level gate to make them appear. Incidentally, as long as the main body remained in the otherworld, they could be resurrected even if the alter ego died! However, because that gate hasn't fully manifested, they can only display a weakened power of less than half at most. Also, even if they were revived, only memories and experiences are inherited, and it is necessary to find another possessor.

There were advantages, but the disadvantages were greater. By expanding the 'Underworld Gate', they could return to another world even if they are incarnated, so the phantoms were aiming for complete manifestation. The 'Underworld Gate' was expanding day by day, and it was expanding faster than Velgrynd had expected. It was about 100,000 in existence value, so a low-intermediate level 'lieutenant' would be able to fully manifest without any problems.

The mental-controlled captives were lined up in front of the Underworld Gate. One by one, they are possessed by demons. The greatest advantage to the incarnation is that the phantoms can take their names. As half-mental life forms, they are unstable beings. By acquiring a body and a name, they established a strong sense of self. As a result of the knowledge they gain from the body they possess, even the lowest-ranking soldier had become useful in their own right.

"There's no need to be so hasty Masahiko-sama. Our plan is on track. I've surveyed our world's strength and found few who pose a threat."

It was David Reagan who advised Masahiko to use the demon lord's powers. The demon that possessed him was of the rank of General, one of the highest-ranking Demon Lord Seeds. He is one of the strongest demons to achieve full manifestation, with an existence value of up to six hundred thousand. No wonder Kondou couldn't win. David's opponent, Li Jinlong, is the one to complain about this.

"I told you many times. Do you remember, Fist Saint Xianhua is still here? The way I remember her, she's as good a match as any officer could have."

An 'officer' is a mid-range phantom rank. In the Otherworld, they are as powerful as Demon Lord Seeds and were the leaders of a thousand-man regiment that was the key to the invasion. Unlike the lower-ranked ones, they were a formidable force, and losing them would seriously affect their plans. Li Jinlong's advice was right. But David laughs.

"It's all right. That man, Pulcinella-sama, has been sent to take care of him. Xianhua is no match for him."

Li Jinlong is surprised to hear this, but was convinced with a grin. Mystery Monk Pulcinella, one of mankind's best hope for the future. He left the oracle behind and went on a quest to find out what happened. There he fought fierce battles with demons, but was cruelly defeated and captured. There was only one reason for this. The only reason he was taken prisoner was to have a demon of the same rank as Masahiko and his 'chief strategist' as an excellent retainer. That tragedy was fulfilled. He was now a demon of the same rank as Amari Masahiko.

"Seriously? I was going to go in there, but I was beaten to it. It's easy enough to kill them, but we'd destroy them too. Well, Pulcinella-sama won't have a problem with that."

David agreed, if a little irreverently. Humans in this world were weak. In such a situation, Xianhua, who has outstanding strength, can withstand as a substitute, enough to stand in for their chief, Cornu. It's because everyone thinks so that they are hesitant to leave it to the subordinates. They were too strong, even for their own rank, against humans. It wouldn't be a fight if they tried, but it was hard to go easy on them in these unfamiliar bodies. Cornu's lieutenants are on a different level, so they should be able to carry out the mission without difficulty. Because of their absolute trust, David laughed that Xianhua's fate was as good as done.

"Well, if Cornu-sama doesn't want a woman's body, then we'll find a replacement and I'll take Xianhua's place. The man who owned my body was very attached to her, and I couldn't stop thinking about her."

"Soft and tender. Cornu-sama won't care about your gender, so you won't have to worry about that."

Thinking that the problem was already solved, Li Jinlong and David started a silly conversation. As he listened to them, Masahiko couldn't help but feel uneasy. It's not that he was dissatisfied with the results at this point. He was not satisfied, but he could say that they have launched an invasion of this world. Under Cornu's command, the two top general counsels and the four generals have already been revealed. The expansion of the Underworld Gate was on track, and a replacement for Cornu was on the horizon. The machinations of Pulcinella and the two remaining generals have come to fruition and the world is on the verge of ruin. All that remains is to reveal Cornu to the world.

*That should be the case. There's nothing to reverse from here. I haven't overlooked anything...*

After calmly analyzing the situation, he had come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong with it. However, the anxiety of Amari Masahiko was correct. It was impossible to assume that Velgrynd had appeared.

"Human resistance is insignificant, but we must not be caught off guard. There are still some finishing touches to be made. Everyone pull together and get to work."

As if to shake off his uneasiness, Masahiko ordered everyone to do so.

![hard scene break]

After the main conference was over, the first thing Velgrynd did was to go to the main library. It is no exaggeration to say that the library had a huge collection of books on its vast floor. The reason why she went there is because there was something that was said in the meeting that bothered her. It was the names of nations and some of the names of people. For example, the Holy Arcia Empire. This seems to have some connection to the Kingdom of Arcia she led. Or the name of the president of the United States of Azalea George Hayes, apparently, is the same one she had contact with before the space-time leap.

If Velgrynd's memory was correct, his father was the owner of as piece of Rudra's soul. His name was Laurent Hayes, and she was with him from his youth until he died a mortal death. There are many other things she was curious about, but she had to look into those matters. If they were in the same world, she could be sure that they were the same nation and the same person, but there are also similar worlds in other dimensions.

Since there are clear differences in the origins and laws of the world, it is concluded that it is not a parallel world, but for some reason the names are similar. Again, the possibility of this being a coincidence was undeniable, so Velgrynd decided to look into the history. The first thing she looked up was the origins of the Holy Arcia Empire, and the description of the Kingdom of Arcia was confirmed. She recognized the name of the king and his chief advisors, and she was convinced that this world was descended from the Kingdom of Arcia. Next, she looked up George Hayes

"Oh, that's right. His father's name was Laurent Hayes. He was the president seven generations ago, so that must be it. So...George-kun could have been president, too."

Velgrynd smiles, remembering the respect George had for his father. He wanted to be a great president, just like his father. Laurent died at the age of 62, while George was only 27 then. Today's George is fifty-two years old, so in this space-time leap, she appeared 25 years later in the same world. Twenty-five years ago, Akira Sakura would have been alive and well, so someone with a piece of Rudra's soul must have existed at the same time. That is a very rare pattern, but since the soul reacts strongly to death, it was not absolutely certain. That is why, while doubting the possibility of another person, she went to the large library in this way.

By the way, Laurent was surrounded and almost killed by a gang. It was there that Velgrynd was called in to rescue him, which is how she got to know Laurent. Remembering that, Velgrynd feels nostalgic. She switches her mind and resumes her research.

"George-kun had a little boy, right?"

Velgrynd gave her blessing, so there's no doubt about it. She checked the names in the book of names and found his son's name was listed. Emile Hayes---she was convinced that it was no longer doubtful because it matched the name she remembered. Velgrynd nods with satisfaction. It was then that she discovered an entry in the Biographical Directory that bothered her.

"Eh?! Was it my fault that Laurent's marriage was delayed?"

She grumbled in dissatisfaction.

*Don't be ridiculous*, she thought. Laurent Hayes had a shadow of a beautiful woman who had always followed him around, and so on, according to the biographical data. It was true, but Velgrynd was neither aware nor malicious in heart. Therefore, she dissatisfied with this. She always said he was free to fall in love, and she never meant to hold Laurent back. But there are certainly not many women who would court a man with such a beautiful woman at his side. By all accounts, it was Velgrynd who was responsible for the considerable delay in Laurent's marriage.

"I don't know who wrote this, but I'd like to complain about it..."

The author was long dead, but that may have been fortunate in a way. Even after she had finished her research, Velgrynd was enjoying her free time. There was no one to stop her. The only one who could, was Akira, but he was the one who let Velgrynd do what she wanted. Because he instinctively knew that this would lead to the most benign outcome. Of course, there were those who would get involved with Velgrynd. Not the soldiers who knew her true nature, but their wives. The Empress, Akira's wife, was one of them.

"What a mess. A woman who doesn't know the bones of any horse approaches His Majesty before he knows it."

It was a fight from the very beginning. The Empress, from the Duke's family, was fifty years old. The Empress was still full of energy at this time when the average age was about 60 years old due to the development of medicine and magic. Nevertheless, for Velgrynd, she was still pretty. This had happened a lot during the long time she had spent with Rudra.

"Oh my, you'll ruin your pretty face if you get so angry. I think even Akira Sakura would want his wife to always be beautiful."

And then she refused to fight with her. And then she even patted the Empress' face. It was so fast that the empress didn't even have time to try to escape, but lo and behold, her skin was instantly rejuvenated. Before long, the empress's skin was regaining its freshness.

"See, you're beautiful now. But it's important to keep it that way. I'm going to teach you a breathing technique to regulate your energy, so you can practice it properly."

"---What?"

The Empress was stunned. This is exactly what it means to be unable to speak. The wives of the high ranking officials who followed her are looking at her the same way. After all, the Empress had regained her beauty right before their eyes. They were right to be amazed.

"You don't think...that's the secret of rejuvenation?"

They muttered to no one, but Velgrynd laughed and denied it.

"That's not rejuvenation. This is just a way to revitalize your cells and make you look better. It doesn't change your race, and your lifespan remains finite."

There is a finite lifespan. Velgrynd explained that she only activated the cells by manipulating the spirit of life, and thus could not extend their lifespan, but this was misleading. From the perspective of Velgrynd, it is a small margin of error, but the life is extended. It makes the body healthier and cures it of most diseases. The energy intake would be more efficient and one would have a perfect resistance to aging (anti-aging). As a result, the life expectancy of the Empress was more than doubled. If you learn and practice breathing techniques from Velgrynd, you will live a longer life.

"Ryuo-sama, I'm afraid I was wrong about you."

The Empress instantly fell in love with Velgrynd. Of course, the same was true of her attendants.

"Me too!"

"I as well!"

"I'd love for you to teach us how to breathe!"

They shouted out tried desperately to regain their youth.

![hard scene break]

It has been a few days since Velgrynd arrived in this world. Teaching the ladies breathing techniques and enjoying tea times, Velgrynd was gracefully at ease. The military, on the other hand, has been busy. Discussions with the leaders of each country were difficult, and the prospects for meetings were unclear. Due to lack of progress, the main conference has been canceled. Instead of wasting time on useless meetings, it has been decided that the effort should be focused on something constructive.

Akira Sakura has given his permission. So Velgrynd has no complaints. But the frustration is growing. They were losing valuable time. Even while doing this, it seems that the demons are ready, so if they don't do it early, they will not be able to hold international meetings. In that case, they would have to leave before humanity could come together.

*Well, okay. If that happens, the war won't end even if we do something about the phantoms...*

That would be a problem, Velgrynd thought melancholy. So she decided to help out a bit. After all, Velgrynd is a very caring person.

"Are the negotiations going well?"

While asking that question, she rushed into the Foreign Ministry's intelligence office. It's a quiet time in the afternoon, but the intelligence office is a scene of chaos. The bureaucrats are in a panic because of the intrusion. But Velgrynd was unconcerned.

"You're not supposed to be here. This is a restricted area..."

"Shut up. It's been three days now, and I wonder if any country has agreed to meet with you yet?"

"Well, I don't think so..."

The person in charge opens his mouth heavily. The reply from China was a conditional acceptance on the condition that the other nations would join. The same was true of the Great Roziam Dynasty, which was synonymous with reluctant refusal. This is because the United States of Azalea and the Holy Arcia Empire responded that this was not the case. Under these circumstances, it is out of the question for the leaders to go abroad. Even if they were holding a communications conference, they could not afford to do so, that was the truth of the matter.

"We are patiently trying to persuade them to do so."

And the person in charge sounds annoyed. Hearing this, Velgrynd is puzzled.

"That will take a long time. It can't be helped, so let me help you with that a little bit."

From the point of view of Masayuki and others, it was the very definition of tsundere. But the hard-headed and proud bureaucrats are not convinced.

"But---"

"If you listen silently, you'll be fine! I agree that you're strong and beautiful, but information strategy is our domain. I wish you'd keep your mouth shut."

Even though he was angry, he had to admit that Velgrynd was beautiful. It was understandable that such a high official didn't want to be interfered with by amateurs, but this was a bad reaction.

"If it's left up to you, we won't be able to make a move in time for the enemy to come to us!"

And well, it made Velgrynd grumpy.

'Just switch seats,' Velgrynd said, and took her place in front of the communications equipment. She knows how to use it with a quick glance. She can easily make the connection to Azalea's U.S. intelligence in one motion.

<You hear me, don't you?>

Velgrynd calls out from above without even checking the other party. The other party won't have to answer, but it responds uncomfortably.

<You are persistent. I've told my superiors what your country wants, but the President is busy. Please understand that there is no time for negotiations.>

Although it's an enemy country, it was the same in that they were used by demons. That's why they didn't despise them, and they handled it well. But they still couldn't get to the meeting because of the turmoil within the United States. The Imperial side knew that, too, and that's why they couldn't push it through. But that was none of Velgrynd's business.

<Come on, call your president, George-kun.>

<I don't understand you. And it's not polite to mention the president's name so casually. You know he is busy here--->

<If you tell him that Velgrynd is calling, I'm sure he'll listen to you.>

<What did you say?>

There was a hint of confusion on the other end, but Velgrynd cut the communication. Since the alleged enemy president of the United States of Azalea is acquainted with her, there is no way to take advantage of that. The rest is up to them. If she can get a message to President George, then they can move quickly. Otherwise, she would be going to go to them herself. That is where she was twenty-five years ago, so she has the coordinates for George's country. The space-time lapse was also reflected in the coordinates, so 'Spatial Transportation' could be performed without any problem.

*If I don't hear from him after a day of waiting, I'll go to him.*

![break]

So Velgrynd decided to approach the Holy Arcia Empire this time. She had an idea of how to handle those negotiations as well. She precisely manipulated their magical communication circuits and connected them to the channel in an instant. She called up the number and made her demands unilaterally.

<Tell the emperor that he must do as I ask. Then I will provide you with another sacred artifact. Sword, spear, bow, whatever you wish. I, Velgrynd, will make you a promise so you should move quickly.>

The person being told is puzzled. They don't remember being obliged to obey a woman who calls herself Velgrynd, but the call is on a formal international line. There was no option to ignore it. However, there was no way he could see the Emperor as a communications officer, even if he wanted to. The real intention was not to make a mess. But he still reported to his superiors. The reason being the word 'sacred artifact.'

In the Holy Arcia Empire, there was a fighting group that was well known in other lands. As a national force, they are known as the Seven Sacred Vessels. These seven possess abilities beyond human knowledge...but it is their weapons that are the most famous. Only when they are chosen to be owners of the weapons can they call themselves one of the Seven Vessels. This story has been handed down since the beginning of the nation's history and is known to all of Arcia's people. Of course, others knew it, but it was a great sin to speak of it so casually.

That's more than one man would ever say in a conversation on the phone between nations. Since the contents of the communication were recorded as evidence, it was no wonder the war had escalated because of it. That is why there was no choice but to tell them. Anticipating this, Velgrynd's negotiating skills were evident. But it was awful for those who were listening.

"You! It was enough with the United States of Azalea. No, it's not good, but I would argue that you're not the only one responsible. But there's no excuse for the Holy Arcia Empire!"

"Yes, that's right! Moreover, using an alias is a brazen thing to do. It'll be found out, and we'll be in big trouble!"

Velgrynd had no intention of using a false name, but to an uninformed person it seemed like she was trying to deceive them. It was a misunderstanding, but Velgrynd was too lazy to explain, so she let it slide. Either way, it's up to them. There was no point in making a fuss here.

![hard scene break]

That's how Velgrynd finished her preparations. Ignore the complaints. Gracefully, She prepared a cup of tea and enjoyed it while waiting for word. The Ministry of Foreign Affair's chief of intelligence fell silent, looking furious. Depending on how the other side responds, he'd do whatever it took to blame Velgrynd.

*I'll give you credit for being strong, girl. But I'm not fooled. I kept silent because I was in front of His Majesty, but I imagine that she has a mind to deceive us with her grandiose lies while everyone's minds are weak.*

He was engulfed in fumes during the main conference, but in retrospect, Velgrynd's story is too wild to be true. If they are true, there is no hope left for mankind. No matter how powerful Velgrynd is, they are no match for the mythical army. With that in mind, the official's hostility toward the Velgrynd was growing. It was the flip side of his fear, but he was unaware of it. He just drowned his fears in anger. And then he waits for a while.

<Velgrynd? It's me, Velgrynd!>

The call was from the United States of Azalea. This is surprisingly fast compared to usual. And there's no doubt in her mind who the caller is...

<Oh, George-kun, right? I hear that you're the president now? I wish Laurent could have seen you as a grown-up.>

It was President George himself.

<Oh, you really are Velgrynd! I'm so glad. I didn't think I'd ever hear from you again.>

Those who were listening to the conversation were amazed beyond words.

*Ah?! Wasn't 'Velgrynd' a fake name? No, that's not important. I seriously don't understand how Ryuo-dono could know the President...*

The senior official was also confused. He was about to dismiss her as an insolent liar, and now he's developed respect for her. Velgrynd didn't care what people thought.

<So, George-kun. I'm sorry, but we have to get to the important stuff first and can catch up later. Do you understand the situation?>

<Yes, you're right. I've got something I want to talk to you about too. Can you listen to me after this matter?>

<Of course. You're Laurent's pride and joy, so you're like a child to me too.>

<Thank you. That's a relief to hear. So, it's quite a situation, but I think we'll have to reconcile it.>

<I agree. So, then, can you agree to what we ask of you?>

<Not a problem. When will the meeting take place?>

<I'll check with Rudra---the Emperor---and get back to you.>

<Well, so there was another one at the same time as my father, wasn't there? All right. I can't wait right here, but I'll make arrangements to be available at any time.>

And so, the call ended. Velgrynd had successfully made an appointment with the President. It wasn't long before word from Arcia arrived.

<Is Velgrynd-sama there?>

<It's me.>

<Excuse me. I am Bright, First Chair of the Seven Vessels of the Holy Arcia Empire. I have the honor of speaking with Velgrynd-sama, but I would like to confirm one point.>

<...What is it?>

<Is it true that you are the Goddess herself?>

<What? What's the point of that question?>

He was talking about how he was going to find out if Velgrynd's words were true or false.

<Or is there anyone still alive who can judge the truth of my words?>

<No, that's not...>

<In the first place, I didn't think the king wouldn't respond to my name when I mentioned it. It's pathetic. Shin's descendants have become so small.>

<Shin? You mean, His Majesty Shin, the Emperor? You are insulting the Imperial Family of Arcia--->

<And I've been wondering, why are you called the Seven Sacred Vessels? I left you twelve mythical-grade vessels. I don't think it's true, but were they lost or stolen? I mean, what makes you think that there isn't someone out there who's qualified to be a mastermind?>

Bright's anger fizzled out. The chief of the Seven Vessels was convinced at this point. The woman who answered his questions, the one who claimed to be Velgrynd, was undoubtedly the true goddess.

*I remember hearing from my master that there were twelve sacred artifacts. This is a true story that has only survived by oral tradition, so the one who knows this must be the real one.*

There used to be twelve sacred artifacts. Because they were a national asset and trump card, it was stipulated that only seven would be disclosed. But that doesn't mean there are twelve owners of the artifacts. As Velgrynd pointed out, there were only eight of them at the moment. In the more than four thousand years of history of the Holy Arcia Empire, three of its sacred artifacts had been lost. One betrayal and two non-returnees. Now there are only nine artifacts left in Arcia's possession. And now there is only one secret member of the emperor's secret army, and one masterless artifact still languishing in a treasure trove of dead treasure.

The fact that Velgrynd had guessed so well upset Bright. But that's not the only reason. All Bright had to do was to hear Velgrynd's voice and he was overwhelmed. It was more that he sensed that Velgrynd's voice was real. So, regardless of what Velgrynd said, Bright bowed down to the communications equipment. It didn't matter if he didn't see her or not. It was his respect for Velgrynd that made him do it.

<I'm sorry, Goddess. I will immediately send a message to Emperor Arcia and inform him of your request!>

<...Oh, really? Well in that case, it's okay to entrust it to you, so move quickly.>

<Haha!>

Velgrynd wasn't quite ready to complain yet, but she allowed Bright to go ahead with her goal. Thus, the Holy Arcia Empire agreed to her request.

![soft scene break]

"Well then, next is the Great Roziam Dynasty."

With that muttered, Velgrynd once again turned on the communications equipment and channeled it to the Foreign Intelligence Agency of the Great Roziam Dynasty. However, the signal that was supposed to connect was blocked by some kind of interference.

"That's odd. You there, when was the last time you contacted the Great Roziam Dynasty?"

The designated representative replies hastily.

"In the early hours of the morning today! We've been in regular contact six times a day, day and night."

Since it was wartime, the window was open regardless of time difference. This is an action in accordance with the agreement of each country, and it is a measure to negotiate quickly according to the war situation. Normally they would negotiate a ceasefire, but this time they are using it to share information on the common enemy, the demon. Since both sides were in a position to allow the military to run amok, they were also trying to understand the current situation when considering the timings to explain to the people.

"There was nothing unusual in that case, was there?"

"Yes, not particularly..."

There was no progress, but there was nothing unusual. The person in charge replied, puzzled. Now is just the time for a regular lunchtime call. It's unlikely that the other party is not at home, and since the communication facility is not in one place, it's unlikely that the machine is malfunctioning. Certainly, there was a high probability that something out of the ordinary had occurred, even the person in charge had come to the conclusion. Under such circumstances, Velgrynd is operating normally.

*Magical interference is just not on this world's level. In other words, it's safe to assume that the demon has done something. But they're still unlucky to have done it when I'm on to them. No. It's different. Rudra's luck must be working. That's my Rudra!*

She was responding with happy thoughts. Well, magic and witchcraft are the norm in this world, and it is difficult to use magic that can interfere with the laws of the world. So Velgrynd's guess was indeed correct. However, complimenting Rudra here was an overestimate. This is because the current Akira Sakura does not have such power, so this situation was just a coincidence. In other words, the phantoms were unlucky. The plan for the invasion was guaranteed to fall apart once Velgrynd intervened in earnest.

Velgrynd quickly manipulated the communication equipment and drew a precise magic circle in the air. Two magic circles no larger than thirty centimeters in diameter illuminated the communications equipment with a mysterious glow. Velgrynd's magic was transformed into radio waves that are delivered to the land of the Great Roziam Dynasty at a distance. There it became an interference wave again, instantly destroying the sabotage the phantom was attempting to create. To an ordinary person---No, even to the master-level sorcerers of this world---this was a feat beyond comprehension.

<Is there someone here? Please tell me if there is anyone to reply...>

<We're connected! Help, a demon has invaded the royal palace! They cut off all means of communication to the outside world, and we were at a loss!>

<Don't panic, fool. We belong to the Great Japanese Empire. I'm not saying that we won't cooperate, but we can't just have you asking for help out of the blue.>

It was a valid argument. The Great Roziam soldiers have regained their composure after hearing Velgrynd's response. There was a brief pause, as if they were consulting. Then they were replaced by a calmer voice and the conversation resumed.

<I'm sorry about earlier. I am Sergei, Director of Foreign Intelligence of the Grand Roziam Dynasty. At the risk of sounding disgraceful, we need your support. We are sending out a series of dispatches to the various Great Roziam locations, but nobody is responding. Will your country please contact us?>

If she was willing, Sergei will give an encryption code that will lead to various military bases. The resistance in the royal palace continues, but the power of the demon was overwhelming. They're hiding out for now, but it's clear that if they don't do something, they'll be traced back to their refuge. She knows that if that happens, she won't be able to protect the royals he took out. That's why Sergei has decided to send for reinforcements from all over the country to help escape from the demons in the chaos. Now, the fate of the Great Roziam Dynasty rested on the Empire's response. And yet...

<I told you, I don't want you to make arbitrary demands.>

<Wait, if you help us--->

<Calm down. I don't care about your situation. All you have to do is nod to my request.>

She doesn't listen to people's requests, but rather conveys her requests. Moreover, Velgrynd says she only accepts consent. That attitude was very Velgrynd-like.

<What's the matter with you...>

<I will convey your request. I will hold an international conference to ascertain the will of the world, and you will bring royalty or someone in command to it. If you do, I will help you.>

A question should have been asked about this, but for some reason Sergei believed it. He glanced around the room and saw the noblemen who huddled there, needing to be protected.

*It's my job to protect these men. Now---*

Sergei understood that there was no other way. Trusting the word of a stranger is a folly he would never normally take. But now, even if he was deceived by those words, he still had no time to waste.

*In terms of risk, it's no different, whether I believe it or not. Then in the end, it's fun to dream of hope. I apologize if I implicate the noblemen of the realm in my own stupidity.*

But Sergei is prepared to do so.

<Forgive me, I know you think this is a stupid time to ask, but it is requested that we hold an international meeting. Would it be possible for His Majesty to participate?>

<I will.>

It was the highest authority in the room who answered that.

.........

......

...

Emperor Magellan of the Great Russian Dynasty, 35 years old. Although still young, he has been on the throne for ten years. He was so ambitious that he decided to invade China to take over the northern continent as absolute ruler. Of course, there were objections from the military, but there were also many bellicose opinions, and the war began with Magellan's will be taking precedence...

Magellan also suffered a major setback here. He was tormented by a sense of helplessness in the face of an enemy that could not be measured by human common sense. After all this time, Magellan regrets his decision. He had launched a campaign against China, but it had led to political instability. Magellan had a penchant for luxury, but not for misrule. The people would not object to the emperor living a noble life if their lives were relieved.

But the war had changed the situation. It would deprive their people of their rich granaries. They want to take an ice-free harbor for national defense. What began as a policy of only looking out for their own interests turned into a disaster when the Holy Arcia Empire invaded the Great Roziam Dynasty. They were caught between a rock and a hard place. By the time the demon's plan had worked, the situation was already too chaotic to recover from.

*It was so foolish when I think about it now. I shouldn't have listened to his words at that time...*

It was true that the words of his confidant at the time had turned Magellan's attention to the war. It was later revealed that his confidant was taken over by a demon. Demons are mysterious beings who tend to enjoy causing humanity to fight each other and leading the world to destruction rather than destroying it with their own hands. That's why Magellan is still alive.

*That demon was fearsome. We can't win. Even with Pulcinella, we would still be defeated.*

Magellan shuddered as he remembered the smiling demon with a confused look on his face. Even Mystery Monk Pulcinella, their lifeline, was now in the hands of the enemy. That's why there are riots in the capital. It's true that it is wartime now and there's unrest among the people. But the country hadn't been exposed to the fire, and the food supply hadn't been cut off. The situation was not quite rioting, but it was getting worse. It was a Phantom who encouraged the followers of Pulcinella. Now it was no longer possible for the Imperial Guard to protect the palace alone. With the danger outside the palace, it seemed only a matter of time before they were caught. So Magellan had no choice but to nod in agreement with the enemy's offer without hope.

.........

......

...

"Understood!"

Sergei saluted at Magellan's words. Then he turned to the communications equipment and resumed his conversation with Velgrynd.

<I approve of everything. But unfortunately--->

The Great Roziam Dynasty is in the middle of an emergency. Even if he wanted to, he couldn't go...and Sergei tried to tell her. They will help if they accept the meeting, so they will send reinforcements. If the Empire moves quickly to rescue them, there's a chance they can get out of this themselves. No, Sergei did not want to risk his own life...but he knew that the imperial family, the symbol of the dynasty, must be saved at all costs. But then a surprising thing happens. Velgrynd said she would help. If so, it was bound to be a fixed future.

<Good. I'm glad to see that you're not an idiot. Okay, a gate will appear there, so please go through it and come over here immediately.>

As soon as Velgrynd finished speaking, the space in front of Sergei's eyes became distorted. And on the other side of that chasm was the place where Velgrynd sat. This was the 'Spacetime Connection,' a supernatural phenomenon that connected two different spatial coordinates without regard for distance.

" " "No way!" " "

That was the moment when the hearts of everyone there, except for Velgrynd, became one. There was no hierarchy of who was the best. They all understood that this woman---Velgrynd---was the only one who absolutely could not be made an enemy.

![soft scene break]

"I mean, what? Why are the Great Roziam people here?"

"No, no, no, no, is this a dream? I mean, it hurts..."

Some of those who could not acknowledge reality even tried to pinch their own cheeks.

"Unbelievable. According to the literature, there are some people in the God/Buddha class who handle transference spells, but..."

There were those who tried their best to analyze the phenomenon that had just occurred, but their understanding was not up to par. It couldn't be helped since it was an unimaginable supernatural power, such as connecting spaces separated by a distance.

"In the blink of an eye, the three countries..."

The best of them may have been the ones who shifted their thinking in a practical direction. Anyway...

"Goddess, you are indeed a goddess!"

The bureaucrats in the Foreign Ministry's Intelligence Bureau were stunned by Velgrynd's skill and ability. At this point, no one could go against Velgrynd. The dignitaries have carefully cultivated the respect they've developed for Velgrynd and are now turning themselves to her. They are ready to be loyal dogs.

"The only one left is the Chinese, but now that the three countries have agreed to meet, the terms have been fulfilled, right?"

"Oh, yes, that's right!"

"So now you guys can negotiate on your own."

" " "Of course!" " "

Of course, no one is foolish enough to refuse here. The bureaucrats are proud of themselves and promise to negotiate a successful deal with the Chinese. Velgrynd nodded. Then she turned her gaze to the stunned Great Roziam party.

"Well, is that everyone? I'm sorry, but if you're asking me to rescue anyone other than the ones in that room, that's outside the contract. But hey, if we can destroy the demons in a short period of time, I think we can get them all out."

Those from the camp could only nod in agreement. It's true that there were others in the palace who hadn't escaped. But they were the first to give up on rescuing them. They couldn't be so foolish as to pass the blame on to Velgrynd now.

"Thank you for your help."

Quickly recovering from the chaos, Sergei thanked her. Magellan hears this, and also thinks it's time to thank her.

"I thank you as well. And when all this is over, I promise to reward you as you wish."

Hearing this, Velgrynd snorted disinterestedly. Even if it was the Great Emperor, Velgrynd was arrogant.

"I don't want it. You can't give me what I want, anyway. More importantly, I hope you'll cooperate well with me on future missions."

"That's...no, of course."

Magellan was miffed when someone laughed at him for not wanting a reward. But he didn't have the temper to be angry here. Over here, the status of the Emperor of the Great Roziam Dynasty does not mean much. He understood that he was only helped because he was useful.

"Can you at least tell me your name, my benefactor?"

"You can call me Ryuo."

"Okay. Ryuo-dono please continue to look after us."

"Yes, nice to meet you. Well then, I'll have you contact me when the date for the meeting is set, so you can rest easy until then."

Velgrynd tells them so. That attitude is exactly like an Empress. In this place, she was the law. Quickly, a bureaucrat rises and leaves the room. He's gone to get a room ready for the unexpected guests. Another bowed to Magellan and gave him directions. They were to wait in the parlor until the rooms were ready. Even though they hadn't had any meetings, the roles were divided up fluidly. Such coordination is a great thing. For once, Velgrynd took a moment to review the Foreign Ministry's intelligence officers. Moreover, at that time...

Sensitive to see the opportunity, the most prominent official gives tea to Velgrynd.

"Ryuo-dono, there's not only black tea, but also green tea here!"

He didn't waste time waiting for a reply from the Chinese group and was intent on appealing to her.

"Oh, you're so witty."

"Thank you! For me, Yamamoto Kanji^[山本 莞爾 = やまもと かんじ = Yamamoto Kanji.], your words alone are enough to fill me up!"

The high ranking official, Yamamoto continued to flirt with her with all his might. It was also a talent, so much so that his subordinates were impressed by it.

"It's delicious. It has a sweet, fluffy aroma, but it has a refreshing aftertaste."

"I ordered it from my favorite store, and I'm very proud of it."

"I like it."

"In that case, you might enjoy the tea sweets here along with other items."

Yamamoto took out an elegantly sweet raw chocolate fondant. In this wartime era, it was an extremely luxurious item. Yamamoto had to ask for money and power to prepare it forhimself, but he offered it to Velgrynd. It was very good, so Velgrynd was satisfied.

"Yamamoto Kanji, wasn't it? I'll remember that name."

"Haha! I thankfully and happily accept!"

It was Velgrynd who remembered Yamamoto's name, even though she didn't care about anyone who wasn't interesting. She had a surprising weakness for bribes. But money would not have been the motive, so it could be said that Yamamoto's tact was a quick win. And so, it took a while to wait.

"China is responding! They are willing to accept the meeting."

The long-awaited reply was an acceptance. And now, the meeting of the five heads of state was to take place.

![soft scene break]

"What, is that the truth?"

"Yes. I wouldn't tell you a lie."

Akira Sakura was astonished to receive the report from Velgrynd. A meeting between the two leaders, which was thought to be impossible, turned out to be a simple affair.

*As usual, unfathomable. We are fortunate to have this woman on our side, but relationships built on favor are far too distorted to be reliable.*

Depending on Velgrynd's mood, a good relationship could change. Akira Sakura thought that was scary. A relationship of trust is an accumulation. If you do too much, the other person will be angry, or even forgiven, and so on. It is the same between nations, and if you do not share certain values, it is difficult to get along. If the opponent is an invader such as the phantoms, a conversation will not be established, so they will be recognized as an enemy without any questions. It's a shame that an intelligent life form has to resort to violence, but they have to draw the line at some point. However, in the case of Velgrynd...

"Good for you, Rudra. I'll set up the meeting as well, so what time would be convenient for you?"

It's obvious that Velgrynd has full confidence in him, and that's why Akira Sakura feels he has to brace himself. A favor for a favor. That's the conclusion Akira Sakura came to. He has no choice but to believe in Velgrynd, so there is no need to hesitate. He can only return the gratitude he feels with all his might. That's the only way to repay Velgrynd, Akira Sakura thought.

"Thank you, Velgrynd. I hope you will continue to help us."

"Ufufu. It's okay, don't worry about it."

Velgrynd smiles and looks truly happy. To her, Rudra's happiness is her own, so Akira Sakura's response was the right thing to do. The date and time of the meeting is set for the next day, after lunch. Since measures against demons need to be made as soon as possible, there is no time to make extensive adjustments. Therefore, it was Akira Sakura's decision to prioritize efficiency.

He doesn't care about the time difference, or even the convenience of the other side. He told the other nations that this was the case and obtained their approval. It was hard on the Foreign Ministry's intelligence department, but Velgrynd couldn't have cared less.

"It was Yamamoto. Good work."

You could say that he was giving it the utmost consideration, just because he labored so hard. However, it's not Yamamoto who worked hard, it's the bureaucrats who are really poor...

As if it's just their job, and they shouldn't complain, Velgrynd announces her next request.

"Then make sure the hall is ready by tomorrow morning. Be solemn, so as not to embarrass His Majesty."

"Yes, I'd be happy to!"

Velgrynd pretends to be quite unreasonable, but Yamamoto had no choice but to accept. On the contrary, he even seemed slightly pleased. It may have opened a strange door, but that was also not Velgrynd's concern.

"Oh yeah, just move a set of communication equipment to a slightly larger room."

"What do you mean?"

Since the meeting was to be held by correspondence, Yamamoto had planned to prepare it in the first conference room instead of the larger room. He couldn't read the intent of Velgrynd's statement and couldn't help but ask back.

"Asking the others to come here, just like you invited the Great Roziam party. Wouldn't that save us a lot of effort and waste?"

"Huh?"

It wasn't a matter of opinion, but rather an unorthodox suggestion. That's what Yamamoto thinks, but he understands somewhere in his reasoning that it's better if it's possible.

"What, do you have a problem with that?"

"No, no! I'll have it ready to go right away!"

"Yeah? Well, good luck with that."

Velgrynd recovered, smiled, and left. The remaining Yamamoto looked around at the bureaucrats.

"What do we do now?"

"Idiot! Of course, we'll do as we're told! We'll review the settings."

"Underdstood!"

"And in parallel, move all the communication equipment to Conference Room 2!"

"Yes, sir!"

The long night at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Intelligence had begun.

![hard scene break]

It was the fateful day for the survival of mankind. In Conference Room 2, which had changed overnight, Velgrynd nodded with satisfaction. In front of her was a set of communication equipment and a plush chair. Soft cushions were provided for her comfort. The spacious room had been cleared of extraneous equipment and was ready to receive the visiting heads of state. Snacks and beverages are available near the wall, and there are several waiters standing in line. The furnishings were elegant and carefully considered so as not to diminish the dignity of the kingdom.

"I like it. You did well, Yamamoto."

"Hah! Thank you. Just to hear you say that, I, Yamamoto, feel like I'm in heaven!"

A man who specializes in brown-nosing. Yamamoto Kanji. Through the supervision of a once-in-a-lifetime supervisor, he succeeded in gaining recognition from Velgrynd. Incidentally, this is truly an achievement, since Velgrynd's eyes are unusually discerning. Even the military officials who came to check on the situation were impressed by how well he managed to do this in just one night. Even the subordinates who had responded to Yamamoto's recklessness were beaming with pride.

"Well, we're running out of time, so let's get started."

Velgrynd sits in the chair. With the grace of a dominatrix, yet still swift. She handled the communication equipment. The first caller is the United States of Azalea.

<George-kun, how are you?>

<Oh, yeah. It's good to hear from you, how nostalgic. Everything is as usual, so it's a mess. But I'm relieved that you haven't changed, if that's strange to say.>

President George is understandably confused. After all, he was coming to the Empire through the 'Spacetime Connection' without even bothering to say hello on the phone. Even the Azalean government ministers who came with him can't believe their eyes.

"Ufufu. I couldn't have changed. It may have been twenty-five years for you, but for me, we just parted ways a few days ago."

"Oh, I see."

Velgrynd and George are chatting about the past. Yamamoto moves so as not to interrupt their conversation. With a casual glance, the servers begin to work. Even the confused Azaleans seemed to take a breather and their heads start to spin. Beside them, Velgrynd was having a lively conversation.

"It's been a long time ago. Thanks to that man, I didn't have to be bored every day."

"I heard that you always went along with my dad's big legalities."

"Yeah. The day before the typhoon, 'It'll clear up tomorrow' was a big deal."

"I know, that story. He told me that story over and over. Thanks to you, you really made it better."

"Well. There was a baseball game that day, and the neighborhood kids were looking forward to it. He was always teasing them and lying about it all the time. Maybe that's why. 'Wouldn't it be nice if my words came true once in a while?' he said. You know, I was really surprised how it made me work."

Everyone was struck by the story that the typhoon had disappeared.

"You're kidding..."

"You don't even want to hide that you're not normal."

Some couldn't hide their surprise. Without realizing it, or even if they did, they didn't care, the conversation between Velgrynd and the President continued.

"Is that so? All Dad said was that 'the kids were freaked out and it was super funny', so I never knew that was the reason..."

"Uh-huh. The kids were so excited, too. The players got all worked up that day, and we had an oversized home run."

"I'm sure that's true. My kids love baseball, too."

At this point, Velgrynd noticed that George's expression had become cloudy. It was a subtle change that a normal person wouldn't notice, but Velgrynd noticed it because she could read other people's emotions from their thoughts.

![break]

"Speaking of which, how is Emile-chan doing?"

Emile Hayes, the name of George's son. Velgrynd deduces from her conversation with George that Emile is the reason for George's anxiety. So she decided to use his name as a sounding board for George to talk to.

"That's amazing, Velgrynd. I'm no match for you, you know everything..."

"That's not true. I'm just worried about you, you're like my son."

"Fufu, thanks. I guess I'm not a good person to talk to about this kind of thing, as a representative of the state. Still, you're the only person I know who can help me. Can you help me?"

"Of course. Because you're the son of my beloved Laurent Hayes, the genius scammer."

George bursts into tears when he hears this. Then, after muttering to help his son, he started talking about the situation. Things have gotten pretty ugly, from what is heard. The US Department of Defense is already aware that the US military in Azalea has been hijacked by the Phantom. Worst of all, Fleet Commander-in-Chief: David Reagan has sent a messenger with a demand to the government. The demand is that the United States government accept the demon's control. The demon's goal is not to end humanity. They want to rule this world and build their own paradise. That's why they thought that if they destroyed the organization that governed the nation, it would be too much trouble to deal with afterwards.

"---That's why they told us to follow them. That way, they wouldn't take away the government officials' free will, and they'd continue to guarantee our safety."

"Hmm. And what if you don't give in to the demands?"

"They're going to send the Grand South Sea Fleet to attack the capital of the United States. And at the same time, they're going to tell the people exactly what's happening. That will destroy the prestige of the government and cause uncontrollable panic. The truth is that we have no idea what to do."

Given the choices, the opinions are divided. But whichever choice they make, the phantom has the advantage. Besides, thinks Velgrynd. The demons' goal is to enslave mankind. They want to keep bodies to replace their own in case their numbers grow. It would be better to have slaves under control, but there are five spheres of influence in this world. The destruction of one of them would only serve as an example to the rest of the world. Compared to the total number of phantoms, there are more humans than there are phantoms. Even if the human race was reduced to less than a tenth, there would still be enough dependents.

"I see. China must be in a similar situation, and the Great Roziam Dynasty must have stubbornly stuck to its demands, and the royal family is even in danger of extinction due to the riots. In this way, the Empire was in a relatively better situation."

"It's only a matter of time. The combined fleet of our country and the Chinese will be here soon, won't they?"

"Yeah, I'm here, so it's not a problem. I'd rather hear about Emile-chan."

When Velgrynd let the subject of the Grand Fleet slide, Yamamoto and the rest of the Imperial Bureaucracy and Azalea's government ministers made ridiculous expressions But no one interrupted them as they waited for George to speak. They were afraid to interrupt, lest they might offend Velgrynd. At this point everyone knew that Velgrynd was a woman not to be crossed.

"The messenger who came was Emile. He had the same face as my son, the same knowledge, but he had a very evil look on his face..."

Emile had grown up and become a soldier. And unfortunately, he had been sent to the fleet.

"It's okay, George. Calm down. What did I tell you?"

Velgrynd smiles when she hears the story, saying it's okay. It was a perfect, unflappable, ladylike smile. That smile apparently had a calming effect on the viewer's mind.

"Haha, always so soothing, right?---I remember that, Velgrynd."

As soon as George regained his composure, he remembered his duties as president.

"Good job. Rest assured, Emile-chan will be safe with me. And I'll protect the honor of the United States as well."

"Thank you---If you say that, I can be relieved. Please, save the United States...and my son."

"Leave it to me. We've got a couple of months until the demon is fully assimilated into human form. Emile-chan will be fine. And by the way, so will the other generals."

"It makes me feel better to hear that. But it's been three weeks since I was dispatched, so I don't have a lot of days left until the grace period..."

"It's okay. That's why we're meeting today."

George nodded widely.

"All right. I promise to cooperate to the best of my ability. Let's hope the meetings will be fruitful."

With that, George stands up. The Azalea government ministers who had been watching in silence followed suit. The discussion is over. Yamamoto gave the signal and an usher immediately opened the door.

"Then, I will show you to your waiting room."

Everyone seemed relieved to hear Velgrynd's strong words. With words of thanks, they left the room as they were led away.

![soft scene break]

Velgrynd's next call was from the Holy Arcia Empire. An incomprehensible 'Spacetime Connection' had brought them across the sea. If you imagine their feelings, it's impossible not to get confused.

"It's a secret place that only a few people know, so how can...why..."

One of the ministers muttered. Velgrynd, overhearing this, snorts boringly.

"If you don't want to be located, use 'Isolation' or 'Barrier' whenever possible to cut off all contact with the outside world. Even then, air currents and such will leak out, so it's probably impossible for you to hide."

"Communicating with the outside world... Do you mean you traced a radio signal to the location where we were hiding?"

One of the young men spoke up. Because he was carrying a mythical-grade bow, Velgrynd realized that he must be one of the Seven Vessels. But she's not particularly interested, so she just says, "That's right."

The Arcia crowd is in an uproar, but it's not Velgrynd who has to deal with it. It's like a joke to her, so she doesn't make a fuss about it. And there was another who was arrogant.

"So you're Velgrynd. I am Zang, The Emperor of Arcia of this world. You're the one who claims to be Caldina, the goddess who gave blessings to Emperor Shin, my grandfather, right?"

A handsome young man in his early 20s with blond hair and blue eyes and a well-proportioned body. He was Zang Yulan Dorte Arcia, the apex emperor of the Holy Arcia Empire.

"Caldina? Oh, that's what I was called. I've heard it said that it's awe-inspiring to call me by my true name, or something like that, but I didn't think that the nickname was more established...maybe my real name isn't in the records?"

"You still won't admit it? How laughable! Or did you think that your good looks would absolve you of your delusion?"

He chalked up Velgrynd's statement as a lie and refused to listen to it. That attitude was a big problem. If the top brass made a mistake, an apology often wouldn't suffice. If this was a subordinate's outburst, then that person alone could be held responsible. Or the higher-ups might be able to get away with an apology. But if the chief executive makes a wrong choice, the consequences may be irreversible.

Bright, the first seat of the Seventh God Vessel, almost cried when he heard Zang's words.

*You idiot! After all the explanations I've given you, you have no idea how crazy Velgrynd-sama is? Before that, if you were to see a supernatural phenomenon that had just occurred in front of you, you should know that it was obviously God's work!*

He was in a panic. Velgrynd's 'Spacetime Connection' is obviously impossible for a normal person. If not a goddess, then it's no doubt the closest thing to one who is able to do it. What was the point of offending such an opponent? There was one more person who was troubled by this situation. It was Yamamoto Kanji.

*Oh my god, the Lord of Arcia is an unbelievable jerk! What should we do now? If nothing is done, the fearsome Ryuo-dono will become angry...*

Since it was not just another person's affair, Yamamoto racked his brain frantically. The first thing he did was to send a message to his aides.

"Bring His Majesty to me as soon as possible."

"But that's not---"

"Fool! I know this is impolite, but only His Majesty can stop Ryuo-dono!"

That was so true that even his aides are struck dumb by his opinion.

"Yes!"

As soon as he whispered his approval, the aide scurried away. Yamamoto Kanji, normally a pompous buffoon, but he had a real talent for spotting people who should not be crossed. He used this ability without regret to prepare for this crisis. While everyone around him felt threatened, one man was at ease in making that statement.

"Kukku-kukku, are you speechless, knowing that I'm not so easily fooled? Well, that's just as well. A scammer like you might not know this, but I'm not like the rest of the foolish ones. I, too, have been approved by the gods! The seventh seat of the Seven Sacred Vessels. That is the one you've been trying to take in! The true identity of the person who did it!!"

Zang said proudly. These words were true, and at Zang's waist hung a shining mythical-grade sword. Of course, Velgrynd also knows. She was just too dumbfounded to speak before that.

"---You're lying, right? How could you react like that even when you see me... Did Shin's descendants really give birth to such an idiot?"

At the same time as she lamented, it occurred to Velgrynd that she hadn't responded to his call. This Zang didn't trust Velgrynd when she didn't respond to his call. Of course, a king should be skeptical, so she wouldn't complain about that. But she can only say it's a shame in more ways than one if he doubts his opponent when told something only he knows. If you were told a secret and you still didn't believe it, then you were out of the question. If you believe the secret was leaked, then your ability to maintain confidentiality must be questioned. Either way, you're out. Lack of cognitive ability was a bigger problem than being small for a king.

"Idiot? Did you mean me?"

"It's a pity you can't understand such things. But it sounds like you've got more than 4,000 years of history behind you, so I suppose it's no wonder your bloodline has deteriorated."

Velgrynd chuckles. She was appalled by Zang's outburst, but she was not so narrow-minded as to be offended by it. But Zang was furious.

"Hmph, you still haven't stopped acting, and even taunted me. Foolishness. Then I will ask you! You not only deceive the goddess's name with impudence, but you claim to be able to recreate her deeds, don't you? If you say you can make the sacred artifacts, let's see it. However...prepare yourself. And if you fail to do so, that's when your disguise will come undone!"

"That's so troublesome!"

"Hmph! I don't want excuses. You spoke of something impossible, and you will pay for it. What? I'm not going to kill you. It seems that you are good at what you do, and have some ability. You can rest assured that you will be kept as my companion."

Zang talks stupid nonsense all the way. Everyone aside from Velgrynd and Zang watched with bated breath to see what would happen. Although Zang's words and actions were clearly wrong, they saw a glimmer of hope in the patience of Velgrynd, who was quick to anger. Everyone looks at Velgrynd, praying that this story will be settled.

"You can't do it anyway---"

"There's a lot to say, but oh well. It was promised, so I'll prepare it for you."

As if to interrupt Zang's words, Velgrynd made a blue dragon sword appear. It was created with 'Matter Creation' by solidifying her own magic element.

"This is fine. You guys may not be able to handle it anyway, but it has unmistakable mythical-grade capabilities."

"Wha---?!"

Zang received it unexpectedly and was mesmerized by the brilliance of the Blue Dragon Sword. He didn't need to doubt Velgrynd's words, it had a real glow to it. As a king, Zang was not entirely incompetent. Although he is arrogant, he is not a tyrant and has the decency to listen to his subordinates. Since this was the first summit meeting of the five great powers, he was more stubborn than usual to avoid being stepped on. It was his revenge. It was only then that Zang realized his mistake.

*Really? No way. But that's crazy, right? How could a mythical character from thousands of years ago exist in the real world?!*

And much to his consternation, Zang is confused. Perhaps because he was related to the man who was Rudra, Velgrynd had a soft spot in her heart for Zang. If this were an unrelated person, the negotiations would have been over long ago. It was more than likely that blood would have been spilled. And yet, Zang didn't realize his good fortune. On the contrary---

*---Wait, what? If the mythical goddess is real, then she deserves me! Yes, yes, that's right. If I can have the goddess, all of my problems will be over!*

As if he had just come up with a brilliant plan of recovery, he did something outrageous.

"Kukkukku, is that so! O goddess, Velgrynd! Have you crossed time and space to meet me? Love me? Very well. I will return the feeling. I will take you as my wife and swear that I will love you!"

In front of the crowd, he burst into multiple misunderstandings. This confuses Velgrynd.

"Huh? What kind of joke are you making?"

"Don't be embarrassed. It's wartime now. I can't show you now, but when everything's settled, I'll make you my queen. I heard the emperor didn't have any children with the goddess, but do you think she'll have any with me? If we can bring in the blood of the goddess, Arcia will be ready for a time of further development!"

Velgrynd was speechless at the astonishingly rapid pace in which he was running. She had never been so insulted before and was at a loss for words. It's not that she can't keep up with it, or that she didn't want to understand it...

It was proof that even a person who was good at calculation could lose their heads. Aside from Velgrynd, the audience's reactions were mixed. It was the people of the 'Seven Sacred Vessels' who paled.

*Stop, stop it, Your Majesty---!!*

One wanted to scream at him, but held back and signaled to the ministers with his eyes. He instinctively knew that this was going to be a terrible thing if nothing was done. How could a man hope to bend the goddess to his will? Zang must be silenced before the goddess' punishment was doled out. And yet the ministers wouldn't act. Or, rather, they couldn't. The blank expression on Velgrynd's face made her good looks stand out.

And it felt very scary. It was because his heart was dependent on his own actions. He couldn't expect the ministers to do anymore. The Seven Sacred Vessels grew impatient and turned to their leader. And so Bright is left to bemoan his misfortune. The Empire was no stranger to this. The bureaucrats of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' intelligence department, who were nervous before the meeting, thought that the Emperior of Arcia would not be such a fool. That was gutsy of him, but if Velgrynd got angry, everyone would be collateral damage. They all agreed that they didn't want that to happen.

"What do you think? It's a wonderful proposal! Even if you spend the rest of your life, you won't be loved much by an old man who doesn't have much life left in him. I, on the other hand, would spend every night..."

"What?"

The air in the room froze. Everyone realized that what they had feared had come true. Velgrynd's anger was taken seriously and Zang went rigid. He realizes his stupidity, but couldn't swallow the words he was saying.

*What?! What the hell is this divine energy?! Mythical Goddess---this is even more than I imagined. How could I have imagined such a supernatural existence being my queen?*

Incoherent thoughts flashed through Zang's brain. Then he realized the stupidity of his folly. Taking in the blood of the goddess seemed like a really great idea. That may be true in and of itself, but there are things you can do and things you can't do. Even the god emperor, who was said to be loved by the goddess, was no match for the goddess to give birth to a son. Even his descendant, Zang, was not even worthy of the goddess' favor. And the Goddess's character as described in the literature was, even as rumored, quite harsh. She even tried to destroy the country when she someone she loved was insulted.

Excavations in the region, following the literature, had uncovered traces of the city's existence in the buried strata. The outer walls of the excavated buildings are reported to have been melted by the ultra-high temperature and turned into glass. For some reason, Zang remembered such information only now. Zang paled as he saw a future where the nations of Arcia would be consumed by the fiery flames. Perhaps he had violated the greatest ban on war, but that's behind him. It would have been Zang's complete ruin, but someone made a move.

It was Yamamoto! If he allowed Velgrynd to run amok, he would be held fully responsible. Their lives were at stake before that, but that was of secondary importance to Yamamoto. Yamamoto was not normally a pompous and hardworking man, but he wasn't so corrupt that he would run away from his responsibilities when the time came. Rather, he knew that someone had to take the blame when the war broke out, and he thought it was his role to do so. It was precisely because of Yamamoto that he was able to act before anyone else when he heard Zang's statement.

"You idiot! You insult our Emperor! War may be inevitable if things go wrong, but how shall I respond!"

Before Velgrynd could say anything, he jumped out and shouted, "No!"

People have a tendency to cool off when others are angry before they are. This also applied to the True Dragon, Velgrynd, and prevented her from bursting into anger. That was the biggest fine play of the day, Yamamoto Kanji. And here's the other thing that comes into play.

![break]

"What are you making so much noise about?"

The Emperor, who had profusely been asked for help, arrived just in time.

"Your Majesty..."

"Oh, Ryuo, don't let the young man's words deceive you. Zang-dono must have tried it to see if you're really worthy of trust."

When Sakura Akira arrived, he called out to Velgrynd in a calm manner. He was inwardly impatient, and this was the first time in decades that he had run down the corridor, but he showed no sign of that. He really was a majestic champion. Seeing such an Akira Sakura, Velgrynd forgot her anger. She regained her composure and examined the words she was told.

"I dared to find out how much anger I would have to get angry, by caressing my emotions against me---"

"Uh-huh. Isn't that right?"

Anyway, it was Akira Sakura who wanted to convince Velgrynd. He thought it didn't matter that he was insulted if he could mend the situation. For all that, his wish came true.

"Oh, so that's what happened. I didn't want to think Shin's descendants were that stupid, so that makes sense."

Velgrynd nodded widely and smiled. It was so beautiful and gentle, that it relieved Akira Sakura.

"Now, since the Arcia people are probably tired, you may show them to the waiting room."

When the moment arises, Akira gives the instructions. Normally, the Emperor wouldn't do this himself, but this was a time where he had no choice. As if the magic was broken, everyone started to work together and the great danger had subsided. Incidentally, in a later version of Arcia...

There are many pro-Japanese families, but the Yamamoto surname in particular has become immensely popular. He is even listed in history textbooks as the man who saved Arcia from the crisis. He is described as the friend who admonished the then king Zang...though Yamamoto never knew about it himself.

![soft scene break]

With Arcia and her team gone, the atmosphere in the room settles down. Emperor had gone back to his room to take some stomach pills, so Velgrynd decided to resume her work.

"Well, it's been a long time since anyone's tested me. Zang, is it? It's just like Shin's descendants, you've grown up in an interesting way."

"Yes, you're right. Haha, I'm surprised too."

You've got to be kidding me, thinks Yamamoto, but he's not bad. He's gaining the trust of his subordinates, so he's just hoping they'll put up with it.

"Well, now, the only thing left is---"

"We are a nation of harmony."

"Yes, that's right."

It is an ally of the Empire and has finally agreed to participate on the condition that other nations join the talks. Velgrynd does not know much about them, as she has not negotiated directly with them. This time they have invited the President of the People's Republic, several leaders of the government, plus their personal bodyguards. They confronted Velgrynd with a stunned stare. Turning his gaze sharply to Velgrynd, the President of the People's Republic opens his mouth.

"My name is Wang Longren. Are you Ryuo-dono?"

"Yes, I am."

"Hmph! It looks just like a human. But we won't be fooled. Demon, have we entered the empire of your allies? Or is it just a trick to make us think so?"

Wang Longren called out Velgrynd with hostility. The bureaucrats are puzzled by this, while Velgrynd herself thinks, *Not again*.

From Wang Longren's reaction, it was clear that something was up. Until she finds out, Velgrynd decides it's best not to speak out.

"I don't know where this is, but I dared to jump into the tiger's den. Don't grow up and think your plan worked, demon!"

As soon as Wang Longren shouted this, the guards from China moved in. They were dressed in white robes that looked easy to move in. It was clear from their refined movements that they were experts in the martial arts. But that didn't matter to Velgrynd.

"I recognize your formidable power, demon. But I will not permit you to speak that name!"

"Exactly! The very name of the man who supposedly guided Long-sama, the founder of Dragon Fist, is not worthy of being spoken by a demon!"

The warriors shouted in a fiery rage. But...

The reaction from the empire was somewhat cold. Everyone was left thinking,

*Here we go again.*

*It's definitely her,* the bureaucrats all thought. And so did Velgrynd.

"Long? You know, that guy named his technique as 'Dragon Fist.' Well, Long lived in this world too. So you guys are Long's disciples and have inherited his mastery of the art? That's nice."

Velgrynd had studied the history of this world, but of course she did not know all of the historical figures. It is impossible for the Empire to have information on the secrets of kung fu that other countries keep. It's no wonder Velgrynd was unaware of Long's, the Dragon Fist founder's, existence. But for the Chinese, this is a situation that they can't understand.

"What are you pretending to be convinced of?"

"Are you trying to cheat? But that's not very nice. We're the best of the best, and we will destroy you here and crush your ambitions!"

"After all, you were first. You who deceived us with your precious name, let us destroy you and regain the pride of our country!"

Shouting this, the warriors took up a battle position. Seeing this, Velgrynd smiled happily.

"Oh my, for a human from this world, your fighting spirit is very skilled. You've been training hard and improving yourself. I'm glad to see that you are learning Long's teachings so well."

The way Velgrynd looked at the warriors was no longer the same as the way she looked at her enemies, but rather a master's gaze on their beloved disciple. That temperature difference was causing the warriors to grow angry.

"Do you think you can fool us?"

"It's okay. If this happens, then all at once---"

The warriors tried to rely on force, but someone stopped them. Only one of them was a small figure wearing a black long robe with a dragon embroidered on it.

"Stop it! I'm the only match for her."

The person with a transparent and clear voice was a beautiful dark-haired, dark-eyed girl.

"Xia-Xianhua-sama!"

"But..."

The warriors were about to argue in anger, but when they saw that person---Fist Saint Xianhua---they kept their mouths shut. This was because the strongest Fist Saint, who was always calm and collected and looked cool no matter what kind of enemy she was facing, was sweating and nervous.

"I'll take care of it."

Once she said that, there was no one to talk back.

"So, you're the heir. That's an impressive display of fighting spirit, I'll give you that."

"Yes. I am the Fist Saint who has inherited the spirit from the Fist Saint of old. If you are indeed the Dragon Phoenix-sama (Ryuo), will you give me the honor of your guidance?"

"Of course. I'll do you the honor of coaching you."

With that, the story suddenly came together.

![full page image](image9)

It was decided to watch the outcome of the battle without any chance for the others to interrupt.

.........

......

...

Needless to say, the result was an overwhelming victory for Velgrynd. Or rather, it wasn't even a match, but only Xianhua knew that it was. In the eyes of the others, it looked like Xianhua was attacking unilaterally. Even those who were studying Dragon Fist felt that Xianhua, with her fists and feet, had cornered Velgrynd. The Dragon Fist was not a bloodline, and all the profound secrets would be passed down to the one with the highest skill among the disciples.

The most important skill to be inherited was the one Xianhua spoke of---spirit. This was a forbidden ritual that required one to record every move they learned and pass it on to his successor. Moreover, a portion of his spirit was also inherited, so the quality and quantity of the fighting spirit was increased rapidly! It was not always possible for the successor to learn all of the powers and techniques, but as long as spirit was passed down, there was hope for the next generation. And so Long retired, hoping that one day the strongest fist fighter would be born. Such is the history that led to the birth of Xianhua, the Fist Saint who deserves the name of the strongest fighter in the world.

She had completely fused her inherited spirit and her own vitality to bring all her skills and power to herself. As a result, she had reached a level of strength that was foreign to this world. More than 100,000 in existence value. In the Cardinal World, where Velgrynd was born, she was an overwhelmingly powerful human, even to the point of being classified as an Immortal. In this world, she was unmatched, but this time, it was just too bad. Xianhua was easily beaten by Velgrynd and suffered a defeat.

"I'm here..."

"Uh-huh. That was a great strength. Definitely stronger than Gensei, and in this world, you would have beaten Kondou as well."

Even though she was defeated, Xianhua still felt refreshed. She could forget her doubts about Velgrynd and admit that she was the real thing. And Velgrynd was also extremely happy to know that her beloved Long's wishes had been carried on. She has very fond feelings for Long's disciples, led by Xianhua. Now she is willing to give them a mythical-grade or two unconditionally. It never happened, but there was no doubt that Velgrynd was pleased.

![soft scene break]

A lot had happened, but now the heads of state are all here. All the leaders from China, except President Wang Longren, were substitutes who were disguised as fists. They thought it was a demon's trap, so the Imperialists thought it was inevitable. They've been replaced by the real ones now. But if you ask about their situation, it's a common story.

They're hostages. Only on a national scale. The phantoms in China began their activities by going after the leaders' children. By building relationships, making connections, reaching out to targets. Then they brainwashed them and took them back to their base. Teachers, co-workers, superiors, family members. Little by little, they possessed them and achieved 70 percent of the goal. That is why the invasion of the United States of Azalea was unanimously approved by the National People's Congress.

"I don't think an apology will suffice, but I hope you understand that it was not our intention either."

And Wang Longren bows. To which George responds.

"That's okay. I understand that each country has its own set of circumstances. I have a son that got taken away. When I put my family and my country on a scale, there's only one choice. And it's my responsibility as president, but I'm not going to give up until the end."

"Hm. I'm sorry for your loss."

George and Wang Longren nodded at each other.

"If you say so, I apologize too."

So says Magellan, the Great Roziam Emperor. The military is out of control and invading China. There is nothing to stop this, Magellan himself has admitted.

"In that case, that makes me guilty too. Our invasion of the Great Roziam Dynasty, a fool's errand of the devil's own making. I can now admit as much."

It was an uncharacteristic attitude of the Emperor Zang. After Zang was saved by Yamamoto and Akira Sakura, he calmed down in the waiting room. When he calmed down, he realized how dangerous what he had done was. Zang is not incompetent. He had the presence of mind to acknowledge the situation. And he had consulted with the other Seven Vessels. The Emperor's sword is now the fourth seat.

"One of the Seven had never returned from his incursion into Roziam. That's why it has come to our attention."

The one who went missing was a woman who, eager to do battle, submitted a plan of action and moved her troops on her own without waiting for a decision from headquarters. This was a clear violation of military discipline.

"The national war potential of the Seven Sacred Vessels invading another country without waiting for Emperor's order is an unavoidable problem."

She had always been against starting a war. But lately, she showed a sudden change of heart. Her attitude had puzzled everyone involved and was reason enough to be suspicious. The fact that she was acting on her own, and despite the fact that she was a heroic member of the 'seven vessels', she was the target of the investigation. Even so, they still hadn't found conclusive evidence that the demon had taken over, but they had come to the conclusion that they had no choice but to admit it.

They were convinced because their pride was broken. The match between Velgrynd and Xianhua took place in the courtyard, but it was clearly visible from the waiting room. Velgrynd had treated Xianhua like a baby, as if she couldn't win even with all the Seven Vessels working together. When the Seven Vessels saw this, they saw no point in being overbearing. So did Zang, who had given up on his ambition to unify the world through the Holy Arcia Empire.

*Huh, now I remember. Whoever has the goddess's blessing will be king of the world. If that is the truth...then the ruler of our time is Lord Akira Sakura.*

Because Zang understood that, he became fully compliant. Just like that, there was an apology battle by the nations.

"I, too..."

"No, no, no, no, no, I understand the position of the empire."

"Yes, that's right. And as for the United States, I regret that we were forced to make a choice."

Akira Sakura tried to join in, but he was cut off by Wang Longren and George, who cut him off immediately. Yamamoto and others who had been standing upright by the wall observing the meeting were able to understand what the leaders were thinking.

*Well, if they say His Majesty is to be blamed here, I'm sure his people will be displeased.*

Yamamoto glanced at Velgrynd, thinking that she would make the same judgment. When the apology battle was over, the scene is redrawn. In earnest, a strategy for the demons was being planned, but all eyes were on Velgrynd.

"So, Ryuo-dono, what kind of strategy do you think is effective against demons?"

That was the Army Minister's statement. It's a shameful question. As a military leader who protects the empire, there should be no other power application. However...

This time, no one was blaming him. On the contrary, the other leaders were ready to wait for Velgrynd's answer. That was inevitable. They are powerless against an enemy beyond human understanding. While all eyes are on Velgrynd, their only hope, she is at ease. As if to say, 'Well, it can't be helped', she turned to the speaker.

"You understand that sending an army out is pointless, don't you?"

"Reluctantly, of course. It makes sense in terms of keeping the fleet off the mainland, but there's no such thing as a fleet battle. Even if each ship is manned by people gathered here, it will be impossible to resist the demons."

The Army Minister was right. If they came close to the mainland, the cities would be targeted by gunfire. It makes sense to build a maritime defense line to stop them, but it would be useless if they had no chance to win anyway. Whether or not the demon will destroy the city is also unknown. If they have the power to possess humanity, there's a good chance they'll use the city as is. Then there would be no reason to challenge the fleet. Velgrynd nodded and replied.

"That's right. Firearms don't work against demons, and ordinary soldiers aren't much help. So, we are left with two choices."

"What is that?"

"Either you leave it all up to me, or you can try to do a little bit of work on your own."

Velgrynd's statement was humiliating to the proud soldiers. But the truth is, they couldn't even argue with that. The brave men and women gathered here look at each other for a reaction. And by the keenness of their eyes, they had come to the same conclusion. The imperial swordsman, Araki Gensei, and Minamoto Saburo, broke the ice.

"This is our problem, you know. I have no desire to speak of poor pride...but relying on Ryuo-dono all the time is shameful. If there's anything I can do, I'll challenge him with my life."

"I feel the same way."

Arcia's seven sacred vessels follow suit.

"We don't want it to be just the men of the Empire. We wish to join you on this mission."

"His Majesty Zang is out of the question. I want us to handle it."

"That's right. His Majesty can only do his duty if he survives. Leave it to us!"

Leaving Zang behind, six men have declared for war. In addition, Chinese Fist Saint Xianhua announced her decision.

"If you protect mankind, Ryuo-sama, we will fear no man. Even if we are defeated, you have promised us a great victory. Please give us the opportunity to grow, even though we are so small."

Xianhua bowed reverently. Nine warriors came forward, but there was also one more person who came forward at the end.

"Ah, may I come along with you?"

That was interrupted by Billy, the head of the U.S. Secret Service. He is a combat professional who came to the scene as George's bodyguard. He is a young man of twenty-eight, with a scar on his cheek. He is also proficient in magic and uses his own special gun bullets. But he was inferior to these nine men. Not to mention his physical prowess...his weapons were also not too much to talk about.

"I'm better than others who have given up on their own, but when it comes to being an asset, I'm not that good."

Billy, aware of this, waits nervously for an answer from Velgrynd. George joins in.

"Billy is a very good man to be my bodyguard. He's saved my life a lot of times, and I miss Emile. I'll give up if it's too much trouble, but you can take him with you if you want."

Without a good bodyguard, he was more likely to be in danger. But doing nothing was not an option when humanity's survival was at stake. Billy could go head-to-head with the lower-ranked demons. Believing that, he offered to increase their strength. They will gather all of humanity's strength to attack the demon's stronghold. They would destroy what Velgrynd called the Underworld Gates and remove the threat of the invaders from the root. And everyone was prepared to die for it. And yet, Velgrynd laughs serenely.

"If you chose to leave it up to me here, I was only going to protect what I wanted to protect. But it's great that you're all willing to do it. I'll give you a little help with that resolve."

In fact, Velgrynd had seriously planned to abandon humanity if the former was the answer to this question. She was even willing to emigrate to another world, taking only Akira and George with her. Goddesses are fickle. The representatives of humanity made the right choice. And so, Velgrynd responded to that.

"Billy. I'll allow you to join us. I can't say no to that. And you're just as strong as everyone else in there. With those weapons, you'll have plenty of strength to add to your arsenal."

Velgrynd ordered Minamoto and Billy to produce their weapons, a sword and a Smith & Wesson Model 27 (Magnum Revolver), respectively. Velgrynd took them and, without a second thought, transformed them into mythical-grade weapons.

"...?"

"Th-this is..."

Minamoto and Billy were stupefied when their beloved weapons were returned to them, which had gotten visibly more dangerous. Gensei had experienced it once, so he wasn't as surprised. He just nodded with a nonchalant look on his face. The others, however, were not the same, and were stunned by the fact that the Seven Vessels, who knew what they were, could not understand how such a weapon could be so easily transported to another country! But it's true that their strength was also reliable. This was not the time to ask Velgrynd to carry their weight, so Sakura Akira could only watch.

"It will be better if you use it. But I want you to keep in mind that only Xianhua is really an asset. You are called Bright, right?"

"Yes!"

"Yes, you. You're the best at what you do, but you still haven't drawn three percent of the mythical-grade weapon's power. The others are out of the question. They're only at one to two percent, and they can do better if they try their best."

If they could truly harness the power of the mythical-grade weapons, they would be able to awaken as a spirit life form and defeat most demons. But with their current strength, this awakening was impossible. Velgrynd only made the artifacts available to those of Shin's blood when she created them. They could be used, but they were nowhere near as powerful as they should be. But there's no need to be ashamed of that. This world is weak in magic and fragile in every way. If they could cross the realm and have their bodies reshaped, they would be able to rise above Sage. As for Xianhua, there is a strong possibility that she will awaken as Saint. So that's why the warriors are now ready. And with this, the great counterattack has begun.

![hard scene break]

The phantom Delia strolls through the Great Roziam Palace.

.........

......

...

As a human, Delia was the fourth seat of the Seven Vessels. That day, Delia was assigned an important mission. A demon calling himself Emile was behind the sabotage and she was on a mission to stop him. But it was a trap set by Emile. Even the intelligence officer had fallen into Emile's hands, and his goal was to lure Delia out. Delia was defeated by Emile. Fully armed, Delia tried, but Emile, who had a rough appearance, played her, and beat her to a pulp. It was humiliating. But more than that---

For the first time in her life, Delia, the strongest of mankind, was terrified. Putting aside her shame and ignorance, Delia begged for her life. Emile smiled softly and said, "Of course."

But she didn't know what that meant until it was too late. Delia has been stripped of her knowledge, her position, and even her name, and is now completely reborn as a demon. Delia's rank was the same as Li Jinlong and David, the 'general' rank. She went to war at the same time as the Arcia invasion of the Great Roziam and was involved in the mission to destroy it. The first objective of the demon invasion was to secure the territory. And the second objective was to enslave mankind. This was to ensure their dependents would possess the families.

Not just anyone, but a body strong enough to withstand the changes caused by the magical element. This is where selection is important. As half-mental life forms, demons do not need to eat even if they possess people. It's not that they can't eat, or that they can get sustenance from food, but it's okay if they don't. But the greater the body to be possessed, the better. So they sought a way to control humanity from the ground up. A plan was devised to destroy the five great powers whose conditions were the most unfavorable.

That was Roziam. Most of its land was unsuitable for development. Harsh conditions have made their soldiers strong, but the land was no longer needed for the state. The reason for leaving the royal family in the territory is to entrust the management of the land and the people. But with Great Roziam no longer needed, there is no longer any sense in preserving the lineage of the Roziam dynasty. The demon does not intend to kill all of Great Roziam's people. She believes that destroying the Great Roziam Royals will bring down the existing system of state. This is why Mystery Monk Pulcinella is encouraging his people to stage a coup and Delia is following suit.

.........

......

...

Walking around the palace, Delia let out a sickening sigh. She looked everywhere and saw no sign of Great Roziam's royalty. The Roziam Emperor and his family. The same goes for the government officials and their families. In addition to the knights who worked in the palace, their maidservants and attendants have disappeared. She searched everywhere for hidden passageways, but found no evidence of them. She possessed one of the men to read the memories of those who know the castle, but there was no sign of them. In this situation, there was no choice but to assume that they had disappeared.

"What about you?"

That is said by Delia's colleague, Emile. Now that they were on a par with each other, the banter was casual.

"I don't know. I have no idea where the Roziam Emperor has gone."

"Well, we're in trouble. I don't think they can do 'Spatial Manipulation' as well as we can..."

"Pfft, they can't. That is an act of God for the mortals in this world. None of the Seven could have teleported them."

Delia affirmed that. Her memories of being a strong being in this world make her sure of that. Magic is scarce, so no one knows how to use it, and there is no elemental magic in this world. There is the Extra Skill 'Spatial Movement' that Delia now has access to, but only a few people can dive the portal at the same time. There is no way they could have escaped from a palace that was completely surrounded by them. It was supposed to be impossible. Because Emile was the most physically gifted among those gathered recently, he had been given the rank of 'general' demon. He is too weak to be the strongest man in the world, Delia guessed, and has no knowledge of such things. His body is stronger and his knowledge of this world is greater than hers. Remembering that, Delia feels a little bit better.

"Then there was a hole in the siege, but my gut tells me that's not the case. It's like I'm overlooking something very important, you know?"

Saying this thoughtfully, Emile turns to Delia's spear. The spear, which is said to have been created by a goddess, is the origin of the name 'Seven Sacred Vessels'. For some reason, the sight of the spear made Emile feel nostalgic. He has no idea what the reason was, but he thought the answer might be in his memory. Demons can read the memories of possessed humans. However, aside from important knowledge, things that were repeated on a daily basis, such as an ordinary conversation, were too voluminous and took too long to scrutinize. Most of it was usually ignored because they couldn't spend the effort on something that didn't mean much.

Emile was no exception; he knew his status, his skills, his relationships at work, and his duties, but he ignored the memories of his childhood. That's why he could only remember the word 'Gryn-neechan' about the beautiful woman beside his grandfather. If he had known it was Velgrynd, he would have decided that this was the most important thing and would have advised to rethink the entire operation.

*That spear is really bothering me. Maybe Emile, whose body I was in, had something to do with that spear. I'm going to have to search my memory.*

Emile is worried about the uneasiness that won't go away. Even though he doesn't think it had anything to do with the escape of the Roziam Emperor and the others, he began to search his memory to relieve his fears. In contrast to Emile, Delia is confident.

"Oh well. It's no use caring about the people who got away. They can't win against us anyway, so let's just ignore them and go on with our plan."

"...Yeah."

"The plan was to hold the royal family hostage and call in the elite of this country, but...let's scrap that. Instead, how about we let this palace go up in flames and make the demise of the Great Roziam Dynasty known?"

Originally, they would have announced the public execution of the royal family, thus accelerating the madness of the people of Roziam. They had hoped to lure the heroes to stop them and replace them with their own people. And if possible, they wanted to secure Fist Saint Xianhua, who was considered to be the strongest in the world, not just in China. Because of the difference in countries, whether Xianhua would move or not was a gamble. So the failure of this strategy wasn't too bad of a blow. If the Great Roziam Dynasty was in chaos, the next target was China. Xianhua would come out when the time came anyway, so it was not a problem if they went for Xianhua. Once Xianhua was secured, this world would be under control. Delia smirked. It was that simple.

---But then. Mystery Monk Pulcinella sent an urgent telepathic message.

<Can you hear me?>

<Is this Pulcinella-sama? Did you take the trouble to contact me?>

<Yes. There was a mysterious report from one of my men who had sent me to China first. I had them look for the Chinese leaders, but none of them could be found.>

<What did you say?! You think the humans can deceive us?>

<---No, I think not. I thought it might be some kind of magic trick that only exists in this world, but I don't think it would work against a high-ranking officer.>

<I agree with you. The low-level people of this world are of no threat to us, no matter how much they try.>

Delia couldn't believe that she had been misled, and that it was the same for her subordinates as well. Judging from her memories of her time as a human, even the Seventh Sacred Vessel level was only at the lower middle level. It was unthinkable for Xianhua to fall behind the others. However, Pulcinella chided Delia.

<Don't flatter yourself, Delia! This is the material world. You don't know what kind of change you can cause by giving one magic. I feel my strength growing every day. This is proof that this body is superior. Only in this body can we demons attain perfection. Don't you dare to forget that!>

Angered, Delia was reminded of the truth. This is a lesser world in terms of strength alone, but that's because the laws of the world are different. Delia cautioned her mind that she must not forget her position until the invasion was complete.

<I beg your pardon, sir. A reprimand, I am well aware of that.>

<Then it's good.>

<Haha! So, we're going to get started, but there's actually a problem on our end as well...>

Now is the time for Delia to give her report. They were going to capture the royalty, but no one was there. It was the same situation in China that Pulcinella had told her about, and she couldn't shake the feeling.

<What, you think it's the same phenomenon in Roziam? I can see the palace from my vantage point, but I don't see anything unusual. Or is this an oversight? I don't know, but something bad has happened...>

<What shall we do?>

Delia agrees with the idea that something bad is happening. Emile, who was standing next to her listening to the telepathic message, looked just as nervous as Delia.

<Wait a moment. I will discuss this with Amari Masahiko.>

Pulcinella avoided drawing conclusions on his own. It's a miracle that the sharpest man in Cornu's camp, the Chief of Staff, is now in the hands of one of the best minds in the world. It was only natural for Pulcinella, who was also a member of the 'chief of staff', to hear an opinion from such a man. And the conclusion he comes to is...

"It is a withdrawal. If something unforeseen occurs, all operational actions must be frozen. We will rendezvous on the Atlantis continent to formulate a more careful plan. Do you have any objections?"

"No, sir."

Delia answers immediately. There is no doubt to Emile Thus, the demons had to abort their mission and gather at their home base.

![hard scene break]

When Amari Mashiko received the report from Pulcinella, he understood that the situation was not looking good. They were invincible. Not only as phantoms, but from the knowledge and power they had gained when they were human, they should have been one step closer to taking over this world. After conquering mankind, they will reveal Cornu to the world. After doing so, they plan to modify the planet and use it as a stepping-stone for further invasions.

The universe is vast, but not as vast as the other worlds. They thought that if they had gained a relying spirit and incarnated themselves, they could completely conquer this space-time within a few thousand to tens of thousands of years. At the same time, they had developed the Underworld Gate, which leads to other dimensions, and had their sights set on a further invasion. But then, an unforeseen event occurred. There was a definite element of uncertainty, judged Amari Masahiko.

"Well, what shall we do now?"

Li Jinlong and David responded as he uttered that.

"What is it?"

"There seems to be a lot on your mind. I thought everything was fine, is there a problem?"

Looking at the pair, Masahiko looks at them and explains the situation. The Roziam royalty and the leaders from China have gone into hiding. The cause is unknown, and some forces are suspected to have intervened.

"Wahaha, don't you think that's overthinking it?"

"Hmmm, there are definitely some uncertainties, but is it enough that we have to interrupt the operation?"

Li Jinlong laughed without a problem. David also thought that this was a bit too weak. But that doesn't change Amari Masahiko's mind.

"Sure, we're strong, but we're not all-powerful. Be aware that the slightest carelessness can derail the entire strategy. Now is the time to gather all the information we can. Contact those remaining in the three countries and assess the situation. Find out thoroughly what the other top brass are doing in the other countries."

With that order, the place was dismissed. After they left, Amari Masahiko surrendered to the chair in his office and was lost in thought.

"Arcia doesn't have any of the seven vassals below the emperor's clan."

"This is the United States. We've lost contact with the president and his entourage. I have no record of them going out, but there is no sign of them in the White House."

"Although it is an empire, security is high. We tried to break into the place of administration, including the imperial palace, but it was impossible."

Even before David and the others were ordered to do so, he was already working with his handlers. Whenever there was something on his mind, he would act immediately. Then what he heard was, of course, what he needed to hear.

*Forget the United States and Arcia, I'm interested in the Empire. We have the lieutenant in charge of our intelligence. Gensei might be able to handle him...no, he couldn't. Anyway, he's not that adept at covert action.*

Gensei is the master of Amari Mssahiko, and his swordsmanship is top-notch. But as a sorcerer, he is a novice, and without him, the Royal Guard Corps would have a difficult time dealing with the demon's dark activities. The demon was discovered in a forcible infiltration attempt. It would be understandable if a battle ensued. This isn't the case. If they couldn't even break in, then this was a very unusual situation.

"Well, let's see what we can do about it."

He asked Pulcinella and the others to come back as soon as they've dealt with the situation, so they'll teleport back. By then, David and his team will know what's going on, and they'll discuss the future strategy. But...

It was not about such matters that troubled Masahiko.

*Who am I?*

The human-born Amari Masahiko was possessed by a 'mastermind' level demon. His assimilation rate isn't perfect, but he can use his powers to their fullest extent. No. That's not the case. He was a rival to Kondou. They were best friends and rival---so it's no wonder his spirit was strong enough to reach the ultimate goal. It is precisely because of this that Masahiko thinks about his own existence. Is he really a demon? Or perhaps...

Humans in this world do not have the aid of a universal substance called magic. That's why they are vulnerable, but their minds are free and their spirits are infinitely strong. Phantoms, on the other hand, are often called angels who used to serve seraphim. They were like machines that only did what they were told, such as angels of the dominion class and below. That's why their egos are so thin, and that's why they can't afford to be taken over by others.

*If the human will breaks the phantom's ego, the order will be lost.*

It was precisely because Masahiko anticipates this that he was troubled. As a demon, he believes that resurrecting Cornu is the best thing for him. He should do his best for that and get rid of all obstacles. However, the current Amari Masahiko had a different opinion, instead contemplating postponement on the expansion of the Underworld Gate.

*Once it's destroyed, am I the king? No, kings are a pain in the ass, so I can leave it to Pulcinella. Isn't it better for us humans to rule this world, rather than allowing demons and other invaders to rule it?*

He had that grandiose idea in his mind. He wonders if this phenomenon was only happening to him. A high-ranking general class demon remembers that he was originally a cherub. He was born to the god Veldanava, the Star King Dragon, to serve Cornu. And yet, even though he was comparable to an Awakened Demon Lord in the Otherworld, he was now wavering about his own existence. As long as he was an example of himself, Amari Masahiko, he couldn't let his guard down. He must assume that the others were as well. If that's the case, then who is an ally and who is an enemy...

How is it best to organize them and how is it best to act? Whether or not Pulcinella is the right choice for the king is also an unanswerable question. There is not enough material to make a decision. Masahiko reserved his conclusion. At that moment, the report came in that everyone was present.

![soft scene break]

"So, as it turns out, all the heads of state and government have disappeared?"

"To be exact, it would appear that some of them are still around."

"It's not worth considering. Seeing that the people who are in charge of determining national policy have gathered in the Imperial State, we should consider that humanity is also showing a full-fledged counter-offensive attitude."

"Mm. I won't argue with you."

If the two apex men agreed that that was the answer.

"Then shall we move our fleet toward the Empire?"

It's an open secret that there is an outpost here on the Atlantis continent. The humans know this too, and that's why they've been lured here. Soldiers are better suited to take the place of demons than civilians. Instead of kidnapping them, it's better to have them come to them. That was the plan. But now that there is unrest in the land, that's a different story. It seemed to be reasonably effective to launch a grand offensive and wait and see what happens...but Masahiko felt uneasy as if he had overlooked some important factor. This world is within reach and the reason for that is that there are no strong men. But was that really the case? If this assumption was wrong, then the strategy would need to be reexamined from the ground up.

"I want to reiterate. I want each of you to mobilize all your knowledge and make sure. Are there really no other powerful beings in this world?"

When Masahiko asks that question, Li Jinlong replies with a laugh.

"There's no doubt about it. The only one who is a threat is Xianhua!"

With that assertion, he became even more worried.

"Wait. Then who trained this Xianhua?"

"That's..."

"According to my research, Xianhua has learned the Dragon Fist, a martial art that is passed down from one generation to the next. She is said to have inherited a skill that is unknown to the world."

"Yeah, that's it! That's why she's stronger than ordinary people."

"How did that martial art come about? The founder is said to be a man named Long. Do you have any information about this man?"

When asked that, Li Jinlong recalls. Although he was not chosen as the successor, he was one of the best members who studied the Dragon Fist. That's why he had been drilled with knowledge of the Founder.

"I believe the book of secrets states that a woman named the Dragon Phoenix (Ryuo) guided our Founder, but it's only a biography of an oral history. I don't see any point in that."

"...Hmm."

Masahiko had a bad feeling about this. Normally he shouldn't be misled by such a vague biography...but he can't help but feel uneasy.

"Now that you mention it..."

Delia says what she's remembered.

"Arcia also had a myth of a goddess who guided the Emperor's ancestors..."

Hearing that, Masahiko felt uneasy. Delia's face paled and she was sweating from the nervousness. Since she became a demon, Delia hadn't been affected by her emotions like a human, but the enormity of what she remembered frightened her.

"What is this goddess' name?"

"Caldina---"

"..."

"---It is believed that she took the name Cardinal, which means crimson, but it was said that 'Caldina' was established as a nickname."

The word 'Cardinal' sounded familiar. Scorch Dragon Velgrynd used to call herself that because of the color of her aura, and Masahiko had found that out from his knowledge of the demons.

*It's a coincidence. 'The Scorch Dragon Velgrynd', like Feldway-sama, is supposed to be in the Cardinal World. I hear that she was with Emperor Rudra and has no idea of our true purpose. She couldn't possibly be in this world.*

He hadn't had a chance to talk to the Phantom King Feldway, even though he was Cornu's chief of staff. So, from hearsay, the operation in the 'Cardinal World' was going well.

"The Scorch Dragon Velgrynd is at Rudra's beck and call, and I can assure you that she will never leave Rudra's side. So it is unthinkable that she would be in this world."

And yet, the doubt of whether it is true can't get out of his mind. Delia's pallor also suggested that the story didn't end there.

"Hmm, is that all?"

That's what he asked. The answer was Delia's spear.

"This is a divine object supposedly created by the goddess. It contains a terrifying amount of power, but even I can't use it now..."

" "...!!" "

That statement not only upset Amari Masahiko...but the others as well. It is only natural that a demon general should be able to use a Legendary-grade weapon as well as a limb. If they can't do that, it proves that their weapons are mythical-grade weapons.

"In this world where magic is scarce, how can a mythical-grade weapon be created? Moreover, it is said that there is not just one mythical-grade tools, but twelve in the beginning. I'm familiar with the sacred artifacts of my former colleagues, and I feel that they were the equivalent of my spear."

"So that means there are twelve mythical-grade tools, right?"

"Yes... But I don't think those guys could get more than a few percent of the performance out of it!"

He'd like to say out loud that that's not the problem. However, that would not be a solution, so Amari Masahiko told them something else.

"What matters is the fact that there was a being that could create mythical-grade weapons."

"No way! It's really a mythical-grade?!"

"You're a fool. You should think twice before you speak. How dare you stand in front of physical evidence and refuse to consider it!"

"I beg your pardon!"

With Delia's panicked apology at his side, Masahiko was convinced. The goddess Caldina is the Scorch Dragon Velgrynd. If the coincidences keep coming up again and again, it was inevitable. That's why he can't help but mutter,

"Never thought Velgrynd would be in this world."

And...

And that's what led to the dramatic effect it had on a certain someone.

"...Velgrynd? Even Velgrynd?!"

"What's going on, Emile?"

Emile, who was always aloof and easygoing, was behaving strangely. He seemed to be oblivious to his surroundings and began mumbling to himself. This was not the action of a demon, but a human being, and it was an instinct of Emile's. The others, who didn't realize it, watched with bated breath to see if Emile was onto something.

"Yes, that's right. She's here, she's in this world! If that's the case, then we're going to have to---"

Emile's mind is filled with pure fear. That's the emotion the demon feels. And the other is subterfuge.

---It was Emile, the grandson of Laurent Hayes, showing his true colors by continuing to deceive the demons by pretending to be dominated. The demon's domination was shattered by the fear that Velgrynd might turn against him. Seizing the opportunity, Emile, as a human, fought back desperately. The memory of the smile of a beautiful woman who loved him like a grandmother, like a mother, like a sister, haunts his mind. It is the memory of an embrace that gives him absolute security. The name of the woman, who held his young self to her breast, was Velgrynd. And so Emile called her name. To ask for all the help he could get.

"Help me, Gryn nee-chan---!"

Emile's exclamation was the key to the sudden change.

![soft scene break]

"You called me, Emile-chan. I'm here to help you."

As he said this, a figure appeared out of nowhere. It was unreasonable as it happened in the demon's high vigilance stronghold. The one who was there was Velgrynd. The demons' 'barrier' was nothing compared to her ability to destroy even the Labyrinth of Ramiris. No wonder the demons were stunned. Even the cool-headed and collected Amari Masahiko was not expecting this. He was certain of Velgrynd's existence, but he never thought that he would have an encounter before he had time to deal with it.

"Velgrynd, why are you here?"

"You know my name."

"Of course. Aren't you supposed to be working with our king, Feldway-sama, to help Emperor Rudra achieve supremacy?"

"Oh. If you're connected to the Cardinal World, you should be able to synchronize the timelines."

"What?"

"That's the story I'm talking about. I'd rather just get this over with, you know?"

Amari Masahiko was confused. And yet, the calm part of him continued to think. If he'd been aware of Velgrynd's existence earlier, he would have been able to deal with it. But he never imagined she'd be in this world.

*It's a shame. But why? There's no way a being like her can move between dimensions. Even the Underworld Gate, which we've been working so hard to expand, still can't call Cornu-sama.*

The existence of Velgrynd is equal to or greater than Cornu's. It holds an enormous amount of magicules that cannot be seen through normal eyes. So how did she come to this world? And he didn't know what her purpose was and was at a loss for words. If he could, he would want to avoid hostility at this point. But, however...

"What do you want?"

"It's a simple proposal. End your invasion of this world and retreat to the other side. And I'll let you off the hook just this once."

"..."

Velgrynd smiles, but her words hide her anger. Velgrynd hates those who try to hurt her loved ones. And Amari Masahiko accurately perceives that feeling.

*That's too bad, I guess we're already enemies. But I don't understand. I thought they were allies of Feldway-sama...no, wait? A timline synchronization?*

The formidable mind of Masahiko spins at high speed. And from the edges of the words Velgrynd leaked, he was able to come up with the correct answer.

*So, this person is from a different timeline. She seemed unaware of our situation, but she did not seem surprised by Feldway-sama and Emperor Rudra's story. So I can assume that she knows what we know so far. Judging from the lack of change in orders from Cornu-sama, something must have happened in the future. So perhaps...*

She jumped from the Cardinal World to this world's past. This was the reasoning that Amari Masahiko gave. It was a brilliant mind to admire. It was just a shame there wasn't time to put it to use.

"There will be no bargaining. It's too much work."

This is the reason why he must make a decision. Velgrynd is at ease, holding out her hand to Emile, whom she had drawn in. It was obvious what she was doing. She is carefully separating Emile from the demon that was on the verge of complete assimilation. The demon is fighting back, but it is only a matter of time. Then he'd just have to make the most of that time. That's what Masahiko decided.

"Our desire is for demons and humanity to coexist and prosper together. It's a shame you can't understand that."

"You know, intelligent life forms don't understand what they want one way or the other."

"Huh, no doubt. But we can't give up."

"So that's your answer?"

"That's right!!"

Velgrynd laughs.

"You're a fool. Then---it's time to go, guys!"

The final battle was about to begin.

![soft scene break]

The demons' eyes widened at the sudden appearance of the humans. However, the same can be said for those who have appeared. The human race's greatest warriors were even more confused than the demons were.

"I'm being summoned."

"What?"

"I have to go. And we have to help him."

And then Velgrynd suddenly disappeared. Just as they were wondering, they, too, were suddenly summoned to a strange place. And this is the scene. None of them realized that they had shifted through space. After all, they didn't even go through the portal, they just suddenly changed scenery.

It could be summed up in one word, 'Instantaneous Movement.' It could normally only be done by ten people, and it was an unimaginable supernatural power. To humanity, led by Gensei and the others, it was an act of God that was incomprehensible. In such a situation, even if you are told, 'It's your turn, you guys!', It's a hard to know what to do. It is important to find out what you can do when you are in trouble like this. This is also applicable to work, and if you take what you can understand as a starting point, you can work your way through it. In this case, it was just a lucky thing that they had an acquaintance.

Each of them found their own face and began to negotiate with one another. In Gensei's case, he turned to his apprentice and trusted companion, the man who had been his disciple and companion, Amari Masahiko.

"Masahiko, you are not a weak man to be dominated by a demon. His Majesty is grieving too. Pick yourself up and get back here."

Gensei called out to him and decided to take a look at him. With his hand on the hilt of his sword, he takes a ready-made stance and waits for an answer. Minamoto follows suit, naturally lining up beside him.

"Don't lose, Masahiko-san, please don't lose! Don't lose sight of your own heart!"

Like Gensei, he took the same strategy to call out to them. He was betting on the possibility that they might still have the ego, and hoped that he could overcome the demon...

The person who was called out to was Amari Masahiko, but it was surprisingly effective. After all, he himself didn't have an answer as to whether he was a demon or a human.

"I'm..."

And that's when he started to worry. Even for Masahiko, this development was too unexpected. The problem is the presence of Velgrynd here. It wasn't because he thought he could win that he rejected Velgrynd's proposal in the first place. On the contrary, he broke off the negotiations to embolden his comrades because he knew he was going to lose. To be frank, Velgrynd's presence was on another level. This is not a battleground of who can or cannot win, but a dead end when one is against them.

Then, the best thing to do would be to withdraw from this place. The alternative is to accept the offer, but that was rejected. If he gives in to her demands, the entire strategy is broken, and the operation is over. In that case, the blame would fall on himself and Pulcinella, but Masahiko wasn't straighforward enough to think that was a good thing. Rather, he felt comfortable with the demon's defeat.

If anything, his human side was stronger. That's why Masahiko was shaken by Gensei's call. His human heart was telling him to go back to Gensei's side. The demon's intellect cries out, unwilling to admit defeat. Human reason tells him that there is no point in running away now. Every demonic instinct was afraid of the threat of Velgrynd. These various pieces of information conflicted with each other and tormented Masahiko.

*I see...the demon's greatest weakness is its lack of self-awareness. At least if he'd been given a name, he would have established a firm sense of self. No. That's exactly why I've conquered the demon. Yes. I am Amari Masahiko. I am not a demon.*

Amari Masahiko was in agony. The way he looked was just like a human being. Seeing that, Gensei and the others decided that it was okay.

"Remember, Masahiko! To whom did you give your loyalty? Who did you hone your sword skills for? Strength is nothing but violence unless it is properly understood. Have you forgotten that lesson?"

Amari Masahiko remembers. He remembered that he had pledged his allegiance to the Emperor. He remembered that his sword should be wielded to protect the weak.

"Masahiko-san and Kondou-san also fought valiantly to the end and lost their battle. I admired the two of you so much that it was almost dazzling to me. And yet...the reason Kondou-san died was because of a demon! Are you going to be one of them?!"

It wasn't the demon's fault, but that's how Velgrynd explained it, so everyone believed it. No one interfered and it wasn't a complete lie, so the story was true. So even Masahiko believed it.

*That's unforgivable*...and his heart burned. Somewhere inside his mind, he heard a cracking sound. He stopped thinking and listened to his heart's desire.

![soft scene break]

In Xianhua's case, the demon side called out.

"It's been a while. It's been a long time since we've met here. We don't need words between you and me. Let's fight each other."

Li Jinlong smiled wryly and held up his fist. It was hard to believe that he was in his fifties. Now that he was merged with the demon, he seemed to have regained his youthfulness. More ferociously, he was obsessed with Xianhua.

"You're a persistent man. How many times do I have to beat you to get you to admit defeat?"

"Unless you kill me, I'll never admit defeat. You were better than me, sure, but that's in the past. I will keep challenging you to a fight until I win."

He wanted to take over the position of the Dragon Fist's rightful successor. Even though Li Jinlong had become a demon, he still couldn't give up his ambition.

"Your persistence is the only thing that's admirable."

"Stop laughing. If I win by any means, it is justice."

As soon as he finished, Li Jinlong let loose with a thrust. He was half-armed and slid across the floor, closing the distance in one fluid motion. His front right fist is like a missile. The energy generated by his toes rode the momentum of his hip's rotation and converged into a well-honed fist. With the addition of the demon's power, it was so powerful that an ordinary person would be reduced to a crumbling mess. Xianhua would have been done for if he took it properly, but he danced like a leaf to shrug off the power. That's not all.

Xianhua's hands are wrapped in purple lightning and her left hand is snugly attached to the approaching fist. Grabbing the fist to take advantage of the power of the thrust, she dodges a front leg and takes Li Jinlong's back. She pushes Li Jinlong back, knocks him to the floor, and then strikes with her free right fist, aiming for the back of his head and the root of his neck. A brilliant move that was stunning.

Li Jinlong, in the midst of his divine speed thrusts and in a released fist position, could not help but do as he was forced. In addition to the impact that ripped through his body, he was also hit on the vital point. It wasn't safe for Li Jinlong. But the demon general Li Jinlong still did a great job. Xianhua's fighting spirit was so strong that an ordinary demon would have been obliterated in an instant, but he was still able to stand up.

"That hurt. My subordinates would've died."

"You're still as tough as ever."

"Of course. You won't enjoy it if it's over after one shot. This is just the beginning."

Laughing fiercely at Li Jinlong, Xianhua clicked her tongue.

"You're a vulgar guy."

"You're wrong! You know what I mean."

Li Jinlong was more innocent than expected, but Xianhua was unconcerned and resumed the onslaught.

![soft scene break]

The more moderate pairing would be United States Secret Service Representative Billy, and David Reagan, the Commander of the United States of Azalea Grand South Sea Fleet.

"My lord, you have been charged with treason. I would advise you to prove your innocence in court."

"Let me tell you, I'm not like the rest of humanity. I cannot be judged by the laws of men."

"Then I will be forcibly restraining you. If you resist, I will be permitted to shoot, and I will not hesitate to do so."

"Don't make me laugh. I'm over the limits of humanity now, and I don't think that kind of toy is going to work!"

As David laughed, Billy pulled the trigger without hesitation. Aiming at the enemy is a basic tactic, naturally. He fired his bullets with all his fighting spirit. One shot a day, specially made to give it everything he's got.

They only lasted a week, so there were seven rounds in stock. A Smith & Wesson Model 27 had six rounds of ammunition, each one packing lethal force. Not to mention that the gun had been transformed by Velgrynd into a mythical-grade weapon. The power of the bullets had been greatly increased, enough to penetrate David's defensive wards.

"Guhaa!"

David was stunned as the first bullet shot through his heart. He had let his guard. Aside from Velgrynd, he had thought the others posed no threat.

*This is bad. What's going on?*

He can't help but wonder why he's in such a state of shock. David thought being a demon freed him from his fear of death. There's no escaping pain and sickness if you're human. But as a demon, David thought he would have nothing to do with it. And yet, Billy's gun was a danger to himself. That realization frightened David. The weakness of the human heart had overridden the demon's will. This was an unexpected miscalculation for the demon that possessed David.

Because David's mind was so weak, possession was easy. But now that weakness had become his own weakness. Looking next to him, Li Jinlong also struggled against Xianhua. David was confused by this nonsense.

"Have you changed your perspective?"

Billy goes on. It's not a fight that can be won. He catches the opponent off guard, upsets him, makes him think he has the advantage. He knows that only by gaining an advantage will he be able to win. He has six bullets left. However, one shot needs to be loaded, and he doesn't think his opponent will allow it. If he doesn't finish him off within the remaining five shots, Billy's defeat will be decided right then and there. It was precisely because he was thinking this that he hesitated to fire all of his rounds. At that moment---

Both men thought at the same time that if they didn't get the fight going, they would lose. The stalemate came to an unexpected halt.

![soft scene break]

Some of the confrontations were unreasonable combinations. The demon Delia and the six warriors against her. Delia was furious.

"Hey, why are there six of them coming only to me?!"

It was the last thing she wanted to hear. As if that wasn't enough, Delia urged further.

"Scatter. Help those who look more in trouble!"

But her voice was ignored.

"We've come here to help you!"

Cried Bright, the leader of the Seven Vessels.

"Then put that sword away!"

Delia shouts back, sending the slash away from Bright's slash. And then a arrow fly in for the opportunity.

"Watch out! You're still so cunning! What do I do if it pierces me?"

Because of her heightened ability to sense danger, Delia was able to evade. She complains to the bowman, but the gringo-looking young bowman is out of the picture.

"Delia, I'm sorry, but can you please calm down and be caught? I know you're in a bad way right now, and we're all in mortal danger."

The whip-handler hunts Delia down languidly but precisely. The archer responds with more attacks.

"If you're going to help, why don't you at least try to talk?"

Delia complained, desperately avoiding those attacks. One against six. Normally, the aggressor would have the advantage. But the truth was, Delia was on the winning side. If Delia had her way, those six warriors would have sunk in a pool of blood. She didn't because she wasn't willing to. Delia's human self was coming back to life as well. The demon's strategy was perfect but stealing the human name had thrown a wrench in the works. Even without the appearance of Velgrynd, it would have failed somewhere along the line. To the viewer, it was a clear situation.

![soft scene break]

The strategy room in the demon stronghold has been thrown into chaos by the battle with the intruders. Only Velgrynd, who was healing Emile, and Mystery Monk Pulcinella, who was folding his arms, were at ease. Despite being called a saint, he is evil in nature. And he was so cunning that no one would ever know. Now, too, he sees the situation and seeks what is best for him. It is the very essence of human desire.

The demon's ego was eaten long ago. But that doesn't mean assimilation was complete. Pulcinella's priority was to absorb power, and the demon's knowledge took a back seat. He thought that as long as he had his power, he could handle the rest. Still, he had accumulated a little bit of knowledge, but he couldn't bring himself to study it intentionally. 'Thought Acceleration' would take an enormous amount of time to acquire memories that would span millions of years. Besides, absorbing unnecessary knowledge may affect your ego. This was Pulcinella's misfortune.

It was unfortunate for Pulcinella, because he lacked knowledge of Velgrynd. So Pulcinella made a fatal mistake here. Instead of dealing with Velgrynd, he let his own desires take precedence.

*Amari Masahiko is a cunning man. He must know that if we break the Underworld Gate, we can become kings. That's why I was right to pretend not to notice. That's why he trusts me. I'll use these intruders to my advantage!*

Pulcinella will use the opportunity to break the Underworld Gate and kill Masahiko. He planned to become king, but he saw the chaos as an opportunity. The demon that possessed Pulcinella had always fought on the front lines as Cornu's 'chief strategist'. Thus, he had earned the Extra Skill of 'Life Drain.' Unlike Luminas' 'Energy Drain' and Yuki's 'Steal Life^[奪命掌 can also mean 'deadly palm' but the katakana (スティールライフ or sutīruraifu) looks like 'still life'. Alternatively, 'sutīruraifu' might also be 'steal life', or 'steel life'. I wasn't sure.]', this Skill allows you to harness the energy of a dead enemy. However, it can only take less than 10 percent of your magicule at most. And since it can't be used in battle, it isn't that useful. Still, the advantage was that the more you fought, the stronger you became. However---

Pulcinella's desire had sublimated his authority. This was the Unique Skill 'Mitasumono (Instant Buddha)'^[I could be wrong here, but 即身仏 (Sokushinbutsu) means 'instant buddha.' The katakana part said ミタスモノ which sounds likes 'Mitasumono'] It gives the authority to take away as much power as your body is satisfied from an unconsciously weakened opponent. It's also difficult to use in battle, but it can come alive during melee. And here, in this place, there were some pretty good fighters.

*Kekeke. If I play my cards right, I could double their strength. Then Masahiko and even others will be no match for me. From now on, it will not be Cornu. From now on he will serve as my second in command.*

He could only see his own desires and even called out his lord Cornu. Pulcinella kept watching the situation. He has been observing the situation and has identified a prime target. The battle between Xianhua and Li Jinlong was closer than expected, even though Xianhua had the upper hand. Both sides are exhausted, but the battle is still not over.

*It's a good thing to take from the weak, but that would make me wary of the strong. In that respect, Xianhua is the best!*

Originally, Xianhua thought that Pulcinella was his prey. This situation had come about before he went to China, but in the end, he gloated that it was all planned. Then, he took aim at the moment Xianhua and Li Jinlong collided and bared his fangs.

![soft scene break]

Xianhua and Li Jinlong exchange fists, but there is a smile on each other's faces.

"I'm glad, Xianhua. I've been a no match for you for so long, and now I'm fighting you like this."

Li Jinlong, who had been wearing armor and sleeves until now, was happy to be able to fight Xianhua. Xianhua was his dream. She was so loved so much that she could not just be described as a genius. Li Jinlong's heart for her was complicated. If it wasn't for Xianhua, he would have been the heir apparent. But seeing Xianhua's brilliance when she was just a little girl, he also wanted to see how far the girl could go. At that moment, Li Jinlong must have admitted that he had lost.

"Humph! There's no point in asking for help from others instead of elevating yourself."

"You talk like you know what you're talking about. I'd do anything to surpass you."

"I know. I'm not fighting on my own, either."

"What?"

"It's a fact that only the successors know, but it's not a secret, so I'll tell you. The spirit contains the knowledge and experience of each of previous successors. So, it's only natural that one should be stronger than their predecessors. Our founder's dream was to be the strongest in the world. It is precisely because he pursued such an impossible dream that he has created a way to pass it on to the next generation."

That reminds Li Jinlong too. Rumor has it that the successor will always be stronger than the predecessor. Now he understands why. And he realizes that Xianhua's power isn't just hers, it's the power of so many great people.

"You have the power of others..."

"Yes. That's why I can't lose."

Man is a creature that creates a new path based on the accumulated knowledge of his predecessors. The philosophy of the Dragon Fist is the same. Without a strong foundation, a building will tilt. They had to raise themselves to embrace the power of others.

"So you're saying that I haven't trained enough?!"

"Yes. The power you have is useless if you can't master it."

"Tch!"

Li Jinlong was humiliated, but he knew it to be true. If you only compared the strength, she was better than him. He was still at a disadvantage and there was no excuse. His high spirits were dampened, but he still enjoyed the situation. He's not at an advantage, but there is the feeling that victory is within reach. The desperate exchange of life made Li Jinlong's blood boil. The demon's ego urges him to restrain himself, but he has no intention of listening to it.

*More! More! Faster and stronger, I'm going to win!*

His sense of inferiority to Xianhua disappears and the desire to win only grows. Correspondingly, even the demon's ego began to help Li Jinlong. It's a sign of complete assimilation. Make each other's desires their own and the boundary between their hearts will be dissolved. Li Jinlong is convinced that he can defeat Xianhua. It was at that time. As they collided again, Pulcinella is standing behind Xianhua.

"Nnngh!"

Pulcinella's sword plunged into Xianhua's back in a moment that didn't even take a blink of an eye.

"Kahahaha!"

Fresh blood splattered from Xianhua's mouth as she collapsed on the spot. Only because Xianhua had trained her body to the utmost limit and stepped into the semi-spiritual life form as a Sage, was she able to avoid instant death. But Pulcinella had cut out Xianhua's heart. At this rate, Xianhua's death was only a matter of time. Pulcinella is elated. He had devoured Xianhua's heart and invoked his Unique Skill.

"Delicious. This will greatly increase my power!"

True to his words, Pulcinella was filled with energy. His subordinate Li Jinlong was enraged by this. Ignoring the absolute hierarchy as a demon, the human part of him screams from his heart.

"Bastard! You've not only sabotaged our game, but you've sabotaged my dreams! If you're the strongest, you'll have to beat me fair and square!"

That's what he shouted as he threw a kick. But it doesn't work. It was a desperate right-sided kick, but it was easily stopped by Pulcinella's outstretched left hand.

"Vulnerable! And there is no need for subordinates to oppose. You will be my food, too."

Since he hadn't fully captured Xianhua's power yet, even if he ate it now, it would only be able to provide a small amount of power. Nevertheless, Pulcinella smiled lecherously and destroyed Li Jinlong's leg.

"Guaah---!"

Although this demon had no sense of pain, Li Jinlong's human consciousness was so strong that it caused him to feel phantom pain. Pulcinella laughs at that.

"Stop laughing! You are a fool who doesn't even know how to use the power of a demon and what it means to transcend the species of a human!"

If he had understood his characteristics as a demon, he would have been able to make use of his power more fully. If so, he would have been able to defeat Xianhua! Pulcinella laughed and thought about how he should educate his subordinates. If they were still demons, it wouldn't be a problem, but if they had developed a human identity, it would be tricky. There are advantages and disadvantages. Being flexible was an advantage, but the possibility of betrayal was a disadvantage. Demons have an absolute hierarchy, but depending on their desires, some will put their ego ahead of that. This is certain since that is what Pulcinella is doing now. In terms of strengthening his own forces, he should let Li Jinlong be the example and make him understand his own power:...

*It would be troublesome if he betrayed. After all, I should leave things as they are until we build a ruling system that does not allow for betrayal.*

And he has set the policy. He now thinks he's become a king. Besides, there are few executives left. Li Jinlong will take matters into his own hands and Emile is protected by Velgrynd. That leaves Delia, David, and the questionable Amari Masahiko. Masahiko is a tricky man, but he would swear to be a confidant if he showed him the overwhelming difference in strength.

*He's not stupid. If he realizes he can't win, he'll cooperate. So the question is, who's that Velgrynd? That woman will be sacrificed as a test of my strength.*

He was very happy to draw a future forecast, but that cannot be a reality. After a moment of happy fantasy, Pulcinella clenched his fist as he was about to strike a blow to Li Jinlong. An evil aura surrounds him, as he attempts to crush Li Jinlong's head...

"Get out of the way."

The moment he heard the voice, an intense pain that he never imagined ran all over his body. The pain was so great that Pulcinella was rolling around and was not laughing at Li Jinlong. Li Jinlong could not help but laugh.

"Xianhua, I won't let you die. If you die here, Long's dream will also die."

As usual, Velgrynd does not give a damn about the convenience of others. This is the best way to deal with a dying being. Xianhua, who had been waiting to die, felt like she wanted to talk back.

"Yes, but..."

"Regeneration. Also healing for recovery of physical strength. How's that?"

Velgrynd healed Xianhua with a powerful spell of regeneration of the heart and then regained her strength on top of that. Velgrynd had learned holy magic from her travels in various worlds. She did not need it at all, but did it mainly for the benefit of Rudra's reincarnations. In the meantime, people really worshiped in her, but they didn't know much about her. It was an act of God in this world, but, well, it didn't matter.

"Uhh... I'm healed. I'm not in any pain at all, and I feel fine."

There are people like Hinata who have a high resistance to magic. But 'God's Miracle', interfering with the spiritron had no problem making it work.

"That's right. God's Miracle.' I thought 'Resurrection' was an overreaction. That's good."

"Yes..."

That's right, there was even more magic than that---muttered Xianhua in her mind. Now, she was back in shape, but that didn't solve the problem. What Pulcinella had taken was Xianhua's spirit. The knowledge and experience that had been entrusted to her for generations was still there, but most of her power is gone. Unless something is done about this, Xianhua will remain weakened. This would normally be a big problem---but Velgrynd was here.

"Let me help you. It's dragon's energy, so it's a good substitute."

Far from benig a substitute, it wil be stronger than ever. But that was only on a human scale. From Velgrynd's point of view, it was only a margin of error, so she didn't hesitate to send the dragon energy into Xianhua. The power stabilizing dragon qi strengthened Xianhua's body. Although not quite a Saint, Xianhua had fully awakened as a Sage.

"So this is...the power of Ryuo-sama, which was only given to the Founder!"

Li Jinlong, who had been stunned and left behind in the situation, nodded his head in satisfaction for some reason. His expression was just like he had been when he was a human.

"Kekeke, after all, that kid should be like this. It's only when you're at a high level that you can be movtivated this way."

He was again one-sidedly looking at Xianhua as a rival, muttering something like. Even in the eyes of Demon General Li Jinlong, she was getting stronger. And although a jubilant Xianhua didn't realize it, her life has been greatly extended now that she had become Sage. She would rise to heights that even Long could not reach and would live as the ruler of this world as a 'Dragon Fist Master'. But that's another story.

![soft scene break]

Blown away by Velgrynd, Pulcinella could not understand what had happened to him. Although he was inferior to Cornu, he should have had absolute power. And yet, he was left with unbearable pain.

*What? Why am I feeling such pain like a human being?*

The reason is simple... The crimson cardinal aura of Velgrynd will burn anyone it touches. However, this time, she didn't intend to kill him, so she was holding back as best she could...

Had he realized that, Pulcinella would not have repeated his folly any further. But he was more intoxicated with himself as a king than he had ever imagined. That's why he was so blind to reality and went into things he shouldn't have.

"Surprising or petty."

This is the speech of a wretched little man who can't even understand the gap between them. Even Velgrynd had no idea it was directed at her. So she didn't care and moved on to the next person. She stood behind David, who was staring at Billy, and smacked him on the head with her palm. The cardinal aura destroyed the demon in one blow. It was an impressive feat of strength, but it was just like Velgrynd. Meanwhile, Pulcinella also moved in. He didn't like what he saw and sent orders to Delia.

"Give me that spear!"

"What?"

"You cannot bring out the spear's true value. That spear will be more valuable to me than its disappointing owner."

Pulcinella stole Delia's spear. He senses its power and smiles, thinking he can win. Meanwhile, as Delia is pushed away, her former comrades rush in.

![break]

"You okay?"

Bright calls out on behalf of the others. Hearing that, tears start to fall down Delia's cheeks.

"You're stupid. I'm not human. I'm a demon that has invaded this world."

"But you're crying. Those tears are the proof that you're still human."

"Bright..."

"In general, your memory is intact, right?"

"Let's get rid of the demon, you know."

"You're so brazen, you can't lose to a demon."

At that moment, Delia was sure she heard the sound of something crunching somewhere in her mind.

"Hey Catalina, if you're going to comfort me, you should comfort me properly! What do you mean I'm brazen?"

"That's what I meant. I had faith that you'd come back to me."

Catalina hugs Delia, crying. And the others too. No more words are needed. Delia laughed from the bottom of her heart as her friends shouted in joy one by one.

![break]

Seeing Delia and her friends, Pulcinella snorted unpleasantly.

"Good grief. That's why humans..."

Even David has come to his senses at the hands of Velgrynd. Delia was his only loyal subordinate, but it seems that her human ego has won out. If that's the case, then he can't expect to get Masahiko as well. It seemed that his human ego had begun to win, and he should have thought that a joint struggle was impossible. But he sees no problem. Because Pulcinella now has the most powerful weapon in the world.

*This performance is mythical-grade! It still refuses to believe that I'm the master, but it's strong enough. It can handle that damned Velgrynd.*

And he was doing the math. He was a helplessly unrefined man. But somewhere inside, alarm bells were ringing. He had found information about Velgrynd from the missing demon's knowledge. If he had scrutinized it carefully, he would have been able to find out more...

"I'm the only one I can rely on, right? Very well. I will take care of you myself!"

"Do you think he's talking to me?"

"You're really a stupid woman! There's no other---Buberaaa---?!"

He announced his intention to kill her openly, but it was a bad move. Until now, he had been overlooked because she was not interested in him, but now he was recognized as an enemy. Still, Velgrynd thought there was a chance that Pulcinella could turn back from a demon to a human, and was taking it easy on Pulcinella to keep him from dying. What's really annoying is that since Pulcinella had only taken over the demon's consciousness, his 'heart' was still intact. With this blow, it was shattered.

"So, our mission is over. This man has conquered the demon on his own, so there are no more demons to be taken over."

Velgrynd declared radiantly. The six phantom leaders were present. David and Emile had been stripped of their demon powers by Velgrynd and are now normal human beings again. Li Jinlong and Delia, as well as Amari Masahiko, have reclaimed themselves. The demon's power remains, but that didn't bother Velgrynd. And Pulcinella had shattered the demon's core, but something was wrong.

"Kekeke! Thank you very much! The damned seal that warned me of my power has been broken!"

The demon's power had been fully absorbed and even its form had begun to mutate. His skin had turned pale and his eyes were red. He was different from the lower-ranked ones...he even had wings like an angel. The robe he wears is a modified version of the armor the demon used to wear. Of course, because it had been in existence for so long, it boasted a considerably high performance in the legendary class. The spear in his hand, which he had taken from Delia, had also been transformed into a scepter. In other words, it had now accepted Pulcinella as its owner. Pulcinella's own magicules are insufficient to fully free him. But still, Pulcinella feels as if his energy has doubled. Pulcinella is in a frenzy of euphoria, and he is at his peak. He was foolishly growing to think that no one could rival him now. At that, Velgrynd snorted.

*Could it be that he's a real idiot?*

But she lets Pulcinella do as he pleases. She's the absolute strongest in the world and she's not going to panic. Unknowingly, Pulcinella, in his full form, is smiling broadly.

"This is a wonderfully comforting feeling. This is a power so great it could beat Cornu-sama."

Pulcinella's omnipotence was so great that he could even say so boastfully. In fact, his power had risen to the level of an Awakened Demon Lord, and Pulcinella felt that he had surpassed his limits. However, this was only the idea of someone with a small measure of knowledge.

"That's impossible. There's no way you're going to win the game when there's a difference of more than ten times."

It was such a ridiculous misunderstanding that Velgrynd couldn't help but poke fun at it. And yet Pulcinella is furious when it is pointed out to him.

"Oh dear, what a pity it is to be a fool who does not know reason!"

Everyone but himself thought that it was him. Velgrynd finally realized that Pulcinella seemed to be undermining her. But she didn't know why. He seems to think he can beat Velgrynd, but she has no idea what he's basing this on. She's known demons for a long time, so she didn't expect someone who didn't know her. But if he's are a minor phantom, it's no surprise that he doesn't know her. But a former angel of the Three Marshals would have trembled just at the mention of Velgrynd's name. It was a natural reaction when faced with the powerful True Dragon. Yet, Pulcinella's reaction was very unnatural. That was why Velgrynd was confused, wondering if he might be mistaken.

"It's been bothering me for a while now, but you're pretty rude. You didn't mean me when you said the word 'fool' now, did you?"

After a long journey, Velgrynd has become surprisingly patient. In her own estimation, she's full of charity, if not a bit more compassionate, than she was before. That's why she asked that instead of getting angry, but Pulcinella didn't get the picture.

"I don't know. Apparently, you're a little strong, but most of the time I'm confident. There is a whole world out there with more to come..."

*Oh, he really doesn't know*---Velgrynd realized. He had overcome the phantom ego and was acting by Pulcinella's will. And at the same time, she pitied Pulcinella, who was possessed by a demon and only wanted power, as opposed to Masahiko, who was possessed by a demon and prioritized knowledge.

*That's why this guy has grown to this point without knowing the important things.*

She was so convinced that she was more amazed than angry. Velgrynd ignored Pulcinella, who was making some kind of speech, and asked Gensei and the others.

"What is the right thing to do with this man? I shattered the demon's core, but its power is still intact. Even I can't help him in this situation."

That means you can't take the power away. But Pulcinella misunderstood.

"Kekeke, of course! It's too late to be afraid now!"

He mistakenly understood that Velgrynd had declared to be no match for him. He was a man of infinitely happy thought processes.

"For the spirit of a being who so frankly admits defeat, you may now join as my subordinate. I thank you for your mercy and invite you to join me at the head of the household...?"

"Shut up!"

Another slap from Velgrynd. Unable to react to this, Pulcinella now realizes that this is crazy.

*Could I be mistaken?*

Thinking so, he tries to decipher the memories he's been searching for. But he couldn't do it. When the demon's heart was shattered by Velgrynd, all memory information was lost.

*This is not good!!*

Without knowing why, Pulcinella became agitated. Leaving Pulcinella alone, Velgrynd resumes her conversation with Gensei.

"It's going to be too much trouble for you guys to keep this man alive. I think it's better to kill him, what do you think?"

Velgrynd doesn't care if Pulcinella lives or dies. But she can't leave him unattended. As long as Akira Sakura is alive, everything's all right with Velgrynd. But after that, she doesn't know what will happen. Velgrynd has no intention of taking responsibility and will always travel to find the next piece of soul. In that case, there will be no one left to stop Pulcinella. Besides, she knows that Rudra's reincarnation had happened many times in this world, and his bloodline had been passed down. It was no fun for Velgrynd to let Pulcinella do as he pleased. It was obvious that Gensei's people couldn't handle it, and that was why it would be quicker to take care of it him.

"That's certainly true, but..."

No one from Roziam was here. When only your own heroes are killed, there will always be some lingering effects. Even if you realize that it was a fair decision, it won't be fun. Velgrynd is worried about that and asks what to do. In other words, it's not the kindness of Velgrynd that keeps Pulcinella alive. She simply concludes that he might cause trouble for Akira if she kills him on her own. That's why she left the decision to someone else. Since everyone is from another country, they will be hard to judge. After consulting with all of them, she decided that if they chose to let Pulcinella go here, that was fine. Aside from Masahiko, the others could also read Velgrynd's intentions. So they felt free to speak their minds.

"There's no other choice but to get rid of him. Tell them he was possessed by a demon and that I did it. If Roziam demands my custody, you can give it to me without a care in the world."

When Masahiko said this, Gensei had a hard time with it.

"No, I agree to take care of it, but you won't be a victim. I'll explain the situation and ask them to understand."

It's Azalea's people who are on board with this.

"That's right. If you didn't understand what was going on, then you can put pressure on them. We at Azalea will help you."

"I'm afraid I have a problem with that statement, Commander. But I agree with the idea of getting rid of it."

"Too much power brings bad luck. That's what my grandfather used to say. I think Pulcinella-san's unhappiness is partly to blame."

Billy and Emile also expressed their approval, remonstrating David's remarks. Incidentally, Laurent Hayes, Emile's grandfather, would only turn to Velgrynd for really trivial matters. Remembering this, Velgrynd smiled as an afterthought. The Chinese are silent in a tolerant stance. They don't have good feelings because of Roziam attacking the land. That is why they refrain from speaking. The last were those of Arcia, but they were ready to kill.

"It doesn't matter why. Let's kill him."

"That's right. He pushed Delia away and even took away her weapon. I'd kill him with my own hands if I could."

"Well, that's right. I see no reason to disagree."

"Same to the right."

"..."

And, well, they were angry that their friends had been hurt, and the comments continued with no weight. Pulcinella heard this and knew that his situation was very dangerous.

*This woman, Velgrynd, is going to kill me. But before that happens---*

He thought to come up with a plan to come back to life. Secretly, he put all my heart and soul into this plan. And with his back to Velgrynd, he aimed for a sneak attack. He had abandoned his pride as a saint. Chivalry is useless when you're between life and death.

"You will die! Take this...my soulful blow!"

It was a mystical art in the holy spirit world where evil spirits are destroyed with the help of the gods and Buddha. Add to this the power of demons and you have an immense rush of energy that has never before been observed in this world. The aftermath alone was devastating. The earth trembled and the sky shook. The base that had been rebuilt as a demon stronghold couldn't withstand the impact and began to collapse. Not only had it survived a bombing, but it was stronger than a nuclear shelter. The distance that lies between Pulcinella and Velgrynd will be filled in less than a second. That much damage was done in that instant. It was clear how tremendous the attack was.

*I won! No life form could withstand this power. Now I will be the ruler of this world!*

Pulcinella witnessed this moment, trying to prove his victory. Velgrynd's defenseless back was pierced by this energy in the shape of a spear. And yet---Velgrynd was unharmed.

It didn't work. It couldn't work. It couldn't work because the other party Velgrynd. The energy that could even wipe out this entire continent in an instant was instantly dissipated.

"I'll get to the bottom of this in a moment, so sit tight and wait."

As soon as she said this as if it was nothing, Pulcinella could not help but realize that he would never win. He would never be able to beat Velgrynd. Maybe things would have turned out differently if he'd given up then. But it makes no sense to assume that. Pulcinella had done something he shouldn't have done, at the wrong time.

![soft scene break]

"What a relief! I had misjudged that there was someone in this world I couldn't beat. But you can't touch me."

"Why is that?"

"I am very cautious. I have always played the good guy because I was careful not to incur any resentment. But you stopped playing the good guy because you were sure of victory. But my victory is assured. I already have a plan."

"It's confusing. Just get to the point."

"Kekeke, you're an impatient one. Okay, let me tell you. In Azalea, Roziam and Arcia, these three countries have developed new bombs. The methods are different, but the principle is the same, well, that doesn't matter---what matters is the power."

"You don't think you can kill me with that bomb, can you?"

"No, I don't think so. I'm confident that I can handle it, so I'm sure you won't get through to him."

"Yeah? Then why do you keep bringing up the bombs?"

"Don't be in a hurry. Well, I can understand why you'd be nervous."

By rushing the conversation, Pulcinella irritated Velgrynd. Understanding that it was the right thing to do, Velgrynd continued to go along. Pulcinella is the kind of coward who aims for a sudden attack while they are discussing whether or not to make use of him. It would have been better to kill him quickly, but Velgrynd decided to listen to him. The reason is simple---to avoid trouble later. If he's going to tell me about the deviousness, she thinks it's only polite to listen. In addition, one of the reasons was that she had absolute confidence that she'd be fine no matter what he did to them. So far, Velgrynd had been listening to Pulcinella's story in a relatively relaxed manner, but her smile fades when she hears his next comment.

"What is my plan, exactly? I'm going to steal those bombs and detonate them over each country's capitals. I've already got a hand in place. It's too late to panic!"

The damned thing had already been exposed.

"What nonsense! If you do this, innocent people will be killed!"

"Don't be ridiculous, bastard! Without leadership, the order in the country will collapse as well!"

"I thought the basic plan of the demon's plan was to raise humanity as your dependents, what the hell do you think you're doing?!"

Looking around at the people who were shouting, Pulcinella gave a twisted smile of amusement.

"How delightful. Yes, of course. I'm also at a loss. As Masahiko says, it's best to cultivate humans. But the sheer number of them outweighs the demons. They'll live through this war-torn age, so it doesn't affect us. All we have to do is slowly gather the survivors and breed them!"

Pulcinella boasted that there was no problem, although the plan was delayed. The theory was ridiculous, but it wasn't wrong. Realizing this, even Amari Masahiko stopped talking. Gensei also paled and looked at Velgrynd. If Pulcinella was going on explaining for so long, it means he was stalling. That means the plan is currently in progress. There was no way for Gensei and his team to get out of this situation. They'd have to rely on 'Instantaneous Movement', which only Velgrynd can perform. There would be many casualties, but they must still let the world leaders alone. Fortunately, now that they had all taken refuge in the Empire, Gensei thought that Velgrynd would be able to get them out. That's why he watched Velgrynd but regretted not seeing it. Because right there was an angry goddess. Pulcinella's plan was an offense to Velgrynd.

"It pains me that innocent lives must be sacrificed. If it were possible, I would prefer not to inflict that kind of sacrifice. How about it? Shall you leave me alone? If we don't interfere with each other, I'll give you the empire---no, half the world, if that's what you want!"

Pulcinella didn't take a chance and offered Velgrynd a deal. He thought he had a good chance with the bomb threat. But he had been too naive.

"You're a lowlife. I would have let you get away with any underhanded move against me, but I won't let you get away with anything that involves that person. I won't let you go back to the Wheel of Reincarnation. I'll break your soul and give you eternal suffering."

Velgrynd's true nature is fierce. She's powerful, so she can afford to be, but at the flip of a switch, she'll snap at the drop of a hat.

"Well, wait! That's why I don't want to be a part of this---wait! If I don't tell them to stop, my men will detonate the bombs! They're already over the capitals of five countries. Let's not be so rude."

"Shut up. I took care of that a long time ago."

"What?"

What was said was incomprehensible to Pulcinella. It wasn't just Pulcinella, but none of the people there could understand what Velgrynd had said. They didn't think she was bluffing, either, but it felt like she was telling the truth. But it would be impossible for her to be here and protect five countries at once. That was a narrow-minded assessment. Velgrynd has 'Parallel Existence' so that can be dealt with without difficulty. Velgrynd would never leave Akira's side, so the kingdom was secure. And if she'd been somewhere before, she can get there in a flash. Azalea, Arcia, Roziam and China. All of these places had been visited by Velgrynd. All problems were cleared. The 'Parallel Existence' was separated from Velgrynd beside Akira and scattered to the nations. They then sought out the hidden demons and blew away the new bombs.

"That's impossible! How is that possible?!"

He tried desperately to contact his men, but they were long dead and he never heard from them. Pulcinella's face contorted in horror as he faced that reality. He finally realized just how dangerous this beautiful woman in front of him was.

"Forgive me, please forgive me..."

"No good."

![full page image](image10)

There's nothing scarier than an angry, beautiful woman's smile. Everyone in the room understood that this was the case.

"No, no---"

"Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration."

A flash of supernova-like light flares up behind Pulcinella as he tries to escape. Surrounded by the heat, Pulcinella's soul shatters and disappears. The damage didn't stop there. Velgrynd had intended to keep it on a very small scale, but it was enough to wipe out a third of the continent. The survivors could not help but be stunned. The goddess standing before them seemed both beautiful and terrifying. As an aside, Velgrynd's 'Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration' had caused damage in places unrelated to this world. Beyond dimensions, the aftermath of the 'Spacetime Continuous Attack' had even reached Cornu, the master of the demon possessed by Pulcinella. His attempt to open the Underworld Gate had taken a toll on him, and he had lost his entire army and was injured so badly that it would take him decades to recover. The damage was horrific, but to Velgrynd, it was just another story.

![hard scene break]

"Well, a goddess would have been that way since ancient times. It would be obvious that it's the fault of humanity for offending her."

---Is what Akira Sakura said after the whole situation was explained to him.

"I'm sorry. I thought I had held back quite a bit, but I guess I had more power than I thought."

It was no use saying cute things, but there was no one to rush in. The same is true of Akira. There is no choice but to forgive Velgrynd for what she did. Fortunately, although the damage was far worse than usual, Pulcinella was the only one who died. The demons had disappeared completely from the Azalea Naval Base, which was their base, all the way to the hidden cove including the military port. In the aftermath, the seas were rough and tempest-like, and various phenomena occurred, but Velgrynd calmed them. Evaporated seawater created a storm, but her weather control saved the day. The lost cove had turned into magma, but that too had been taken care of. There were lost plantations and such, but through an unintelligible act of divine grace, a new environment was born that day, thanks to a high healing of the earth. Well, as a result...

Although the terrain had changed, the impact was minimal. Thus, the crisis of humanity's invasion by demons was safely solved with the help of a capricious goddess.

![hard scene break]

A few years later...

Velgrynd never again interfered in human history. It was because Akira Sakura didn't want it. Her power was transcendent. In this world without magic, everything would be a farce if Velgrynd traveled. So, she entrusted it to him. She told him that there would be failures, but that it was for the good of humanity to experience them. Spending a peaceful time beside Akira, the goddess watched over the lives of men. Eventually the end would come. Akira Sakura's life was coming to an end.

Velgrynd and everyone who cares about him, not to mention Akira's family and close confidants, are all gathered there. Meanwhile, while he was asleep, Akira woke up.

"I am happy. I had the good fortune of being loved by the goddess and have enjoyed peace. But I fear for those I will leave behind...do not allow them to fight for me. Always seek dialogue. Keep in mind. Conflicts are boring..."

Those were Akira Sakura's last words. Conflict can be put up with when it's for one's own sake. But when it's for the ones you love...it's something you should reject. Not only for your honor, but for the honor of those you love. Or, conversely, you could erase their fear by inciting it, but that is an unacceptable act for a nation or a religion to preside over.

It sounds good when you say it's for someone else's sake, but that is also an act of placing the blame on others. One must take responsibility for their own actions, that's what Akira Sakura tried to convey. At the mercy of the turbulent times, Akira Sakura had a desire to aim for a world without conflict. He didn't know how to make it come true, but he kept thinking about the answer. Always being responsible for your own actions. Always striving to understand the other and seeking mutual understanding through dialogue. With these two things, Akira Sakura passed away. His face was filled with peace, and there was no doubt that he had passed away.

"You did your best. I'm really proud of you."

Velgrynd gently caressed the dead face of Akira Sakura. Then his body began to glow. The light became a small crystal and was absorbed into the shining piece of soul and disappeared. Holding it to her heart, Velgrynd cried lovingly and sadly.

![hard scene break]

Now that Rudra's reincarnation, Akira Sakura, was gone, there was no reason for Velgrynd to remain there.

"Well then, I'll be going, but you guys take care of yourselves."

'I'm sure we won't see each other again, but...' Velgrynd swallowed her words and greeted them. It seems that feelings can be conveyed without saying anything.

"Ryuo-sama, I would like to follow you."

"You can't do that."

"Maybe. But I'd rather have hope than give up here."

"Well...it seems like I've been to this world a lot, and there are no absolutes in the world, you know. So good luck with that."

"Yes!"

Xianhua replied happily. Some of the people who were listening to that conversation had similar dreams. They, too, were fascinated. When faced with a real goddess, they couldn't help but admire her. And just like Xianhua, they had a secret desire to meet Velgrynd again one day.

"Then I'll see you somewhere else..."

The words of exchange from Amari Masahiko represented everyone's feelings at that moment. Velgrynd smiled slightly. It was unclear what she thought at that moment. But that smile captivated the hearts of all who saw it.

"Yeah, I'll see you around."

Velgrynd said this happily and leapt from there.

![hard scene break]

Decades have passed since Velgrynd left. Mankind was once again enjoying peace. There were nations with ambitions, but their noses were broken by the riots. Several generations would be, and war was unlikely in the foreseeable future. George returned to the United States of Azalea to complete his term as president. Then he would support his son Emile. But Emile had set up an entertainment agency. He wanted to bring some light to a world made heavy by war and famine.

For Emile, who had inherited the talent of the genius scammer, it was his calling. Through his work, the world was slowly getting brighter. He was assisted by Amari Masahiko. He had resigned from the army after the peace treaty was signed. He took full responsibility for the war and asked for his resignation. Akira Sakura, who was still alive at the time, allowed him to do so. He gave a secret order to Masahiko and released him from the empire.

Now freed, Masahiko joined up with Emile and provided financial support. He also used his vast network of contacts to rapidly grow the entertainment agency to the point where it was a major player in the industry within a few years. It is rumored too, that they had taken horribly malicious measures. He seems to have lived a life that never saw the light of day, with several mafia groups in tow. Nevertheless, the two remained close, and when something went wrong, Emile turned to Amari Masahiko for help. This is how Emile's entertainment agency would grow into a major corporation that would be known not only in the United States of Azalea, but all over the world. On a different note, there is an interesting rumor about this entertainment agency.

.........

......

...

In Emile's office, a beautiful girl named Long Hua^[Might also be 'Long Fa' but I went with Long Hua to match with Xian*hua*] is the main attraction. She had retired and then resumed her career after a few years. Naturally, she was replaced by her substitutes, but it is well known that her true face remainedd shrouded in mystery. However, according to the rumors, her real name is Xianhua. Strangely enough, all of Long Hua's real names are the same. This was a dream come true. It's not true that all of them are the same person, but it makes them think so, and it's all about the fans.

.........

......

...

Such topics are often mentioned in weekly magazines, but it goes without saying that they are really the same person. Xianhua had gained an immortal body by taking in Velgrynd's dragon energy. She relied on Amari Masahiko because it would be difficult to live in a human society as it was. Xianhua was not the only one. Others, such as Li Jinlong and Delia, had defeated the demons on their own and took on the power of a Sage. There were others who had also done that. Most of the soldiers possessed by the demons had been freed by Velgrynd. However, some of them were awakened as a Sage.

Such people also gathered under the leadership of Amari Masahiko. It was then that Araki Gensei and Minamoto Saburo-san taught these men the Oboro Shinmei Ryu, the sword that wards off evil. This is how the next generation of strong men would grow up. A supranational anti-demon organization would be born from these men. Their battle would not end until the promised day.
