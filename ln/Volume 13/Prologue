# Prologue: Two Suspicions

Gadra was deeply perplexed, mainly by two things. The first one, needless to say, was about the person who tried to assassinate him.

*Someone who even **I** couldn't sense... There are only a few people capable of doing that. Although, I do have an idea of who it could be...*

Gadra was afraid to acknowledge it. This was because if his prediction were correct, then that meant the emperor was aware of all the schemes that had been perpetrated by himself, Yuuki, and his subordinates. And, perhaps worst of all, that they had been dancing in the palm of his hand the whole time.

*No, it's possible. His Imperial Majesty Rudra has lived far longer than I have. His wisdom and power are beyond the imagination of ordinary men. I wouldn't be surprised if he anticipated something like this happening and made preparations decades in advance. But if that's true, then...*

Gadra was fine now since he left the Empire, but Yuuki would be in immediate danger, and this was what concerned him. Thus, the question arose: Should he warn Yuuki or ignore the problem? It wasn't that they were strangers; in fact, Gadra had somewhat taken a liking to Yuuki. Gadra wanted to help, but now that he was working for Rimuru, it would've been unacceptable for him to take independent action.

Rather than stressing over it alone, he also had the option to simply consult with Rimuru. On the other hand, if he shared uncertain information that turned out to be false, Rimuru's trust in Gadra would plummet. To make matters worse, Gadra had already betrayed the Empire. Any further loss of credibility would greatly affect his position in the future. Stuck weighing the pros and cons of his dilemma, Gadra was unable to come to a decision.

Moreover...he couldn't gather his thoughts because of his second suspicion, which weighed heavily on his mind.

*That face, that aura---it was undoubtedly the same as His Majesty Rudra. However, he didn't react when he saw me, and it seemed like he didn't even know who I was. I don't think he's an impostor, but...*

Emperor Rudra couldn't possibly have been in that location.

*There's no other answer, regardless of how you look at it*---that was the conclusion Gadra came to.

In that case, he must've been a different person who only *appeared* like Rudra.

*If that person really is His Majesty Rudra---no, that's ridiculous. What's more important is the person who stabbed me. That person is definitely **him**, and that means Yuuki's in danger. My conscience will never forgive me if I don't at least give him a warning. Furthermore, I shall also report this to Rimuru-sama.*

In the end, Gadra chose to put his friendship first. His reputation might drop as a result, but that was worth the risk. After all, strength was what ultimately mattered most in this country. And to Gadra, this meritocracy was a dream come true.

Having finally made a decision, he sprang into action.

<It's me. Yuuki, I have to warn you about something. You see--->

Without regard for the other person's convenience, Gadra went on to convey his message.

<Oi oi, this is so out of the blue.>

<I didn't have a choice. Think about my position. Rimuru-sama might start questioning my loyalty for reaching out to you, so I don't have time to argue. I'll do my best, and you should keep an eye out so that no one kills you in your sleep.>

With that, Gadra ended his 'Magic Communication' with Yuuki and headed straight to Rimuru in order to report the situation---carrying out ReCoCo (report, communicate, and consult) without missing a beat. He was an expert in training subordinates, so he did not fall short in that aspect.

"Just as I thought; that old man is safe. Moreover, it seems that he has shrewdly joined Rimuru-san's ranks," Yuuki murmured to himself, smiling wryly as he gazed out the window.

It had been raining for a while in the Imperial capital, and the view from his window was quite poor. Despite that, Yuuki's eyes still managed to pick out a suspicious silhouette lurking about in the downpour. Judging from his experienced movements, there was little doubt that he had been monitoring Yuuki's whereabouts. Although he was aware of this, he had nothing but a pleasant smile on his face.

Another person in the room---Kagali---responded to Yuuki's monologue.

"Are you talking about Gadra? If you are, then it's not surprising at all. Even I, an ex-demon lord, find that old man cunning and tricky. That's why cooperating with him was beneficial."

Yuuki agreed with Kagali, "You're right. Thanks to him, we managed to secure this position. And now, he gave us some crucial information."

Yuuki had fully expected Gadra to bring useful intelligence from Tempest. For instance, information about the so-called Hero named Chronoa. It remained unclear whether she was alive or not. Since Rimuru was unharmed, that meant she had to have been defeated, but still...if Rimuru had somehow managed to pacify that violent thing, then there should've been at least *some* sort of rumor floating around. However, he had yet to hear anything.

Gadra hadn't mentioned her, so he couldn't rule out the possibility that she was confirmed dead. With the realization that he might be worrying too much, Yuuki dropped the thought. What he should be focusing on right now was Gadra's urgent report.

"Huh, is that so? Then...what did Gadra say?"

"He said Masayuki looks exactly like Emperor Rudra..."

"What?!"

Yuuki couldn't help but smirk at Kagali's uncouth shout, which was more akin to her old self. After all, he felt that he probably would've behaved the same way if only Gadra had given him more time to react to the sudden news.

"It makes no sense, right? I seriously wondered if the old man had gone senile or something, but apparently, he isn't joking. Also, can we really rule out the emperor disguising himself as Masayuki...?"

Yuuki's smile faded away as he recalled his encounter with Masayuki. As he sifted through his memories, he realized that Masayuki hadn't come to this world via summoning. He had told him, *"I just found myself here before I knew it."* Yuuki originally thought that he was simply a "visitor" who showed up to this world entirely by accident, but...

*There's no concrete proof that Masayuki is an otherworlder. He could've been using magic or a Skill to---*

Yuuki tried to think through the different possibilities but gave up. He switched gears and began to speak again.

"---Never mind, let's ignore Masayuki for now. More importantly, let's talk about the people that are monitoring us."

"Ara, that was an interesting topic though...but you're right. Being under surveillance all the time is going to feel suffocating."

"I know, right? It's going to interfere with our goals, so we might have to abandon all of our plans before that happens."

"I beg your pardon?"

"You heard me. If what gramps told us is accurate, then we are in a precarious situation."

It would be a mistake to move the Mixed Corps, which was deployed towards the Dwarven Kingdom, if Gadra's words were to be taken at face value. He needed to reconsider what would happen next---no, even before that, he had to start all over again, determining who his allies and enemies really were. That was the ledge Yuuki's group found themselves pushed up against.

"...I see. Then, this certainly isn't the time to be chatting about the boy."

Kagali didn't doubt Yuuki's words. If he thought that it was dangerous, then it was, indisputably so.

"Gramps said he requested an audience with the emperor, when he was stabbed in the back by someone once he arrived."

"Wouldn't that be Kondou?" asked Kagali, but then quickly refuted herself. "Maybe not. I thought Kondou was the only person who could kill Gadra, but if the shadowy Single Digits were involved, one of them might well have had the talent to pull it off."

Yuuki wouldn't have been surprised if Tatsuya Kondou turned out to be the perpetrator in the first place---it was too obvious.

"I agree with that. But there's another reason why I'm shocked. Gadra said he had an idea of who the culprit was."

The room went silent. Kagali exhaled and, while looking into Yuuki's eyes, asked, "...Are you saying that perhaps this person is someone we both know well?"

Kagali's eyes told him that there was no escaping the question. A bitter smile appeared on Yuuki as he nodded lightly.

"It's hard to believe, but that's exactly right. Of course, there's always a chance that the old man was mistaken. However, this is not something that can be settled with a simple apology."

Kagali's eyes suddenly widened, and any hint of a smile disappeared from her expression.

"Does that mean this person is someone important among our companions?"

"Yeah," Yuuki nodded, and in contrast to Kagali, his smile deepened as he spoke. "The name of the traitor is---"
