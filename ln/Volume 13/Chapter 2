# Chapter 2: The Devastation|Begins

All monsters on the battlefield took the declaration from their leader, Rimuru, straight to their soul.

The words of their absolute ruler were met with their loyalty and trust.

Soon after, they heard another voice give an order.

<The feigning strategy is now suspended. Crush the fools who caused Rimuru-sama's heart to worry with all your might!>

With this declaration, there was nothing left to restrain the monsters.

A sense of joy filled the monsters' hearts as they let their natural impetus build up until it was brimming and released their mana.

They unsurprisingly had to suppress their youki while they were living in town so it wouldn't affect the environment, but now, they fully unleashed it. As a result, the nearby magicule concentration rose a level.

There was nothing to fear anymore.

And so, they charged forward onto the battlefield, driven by their instincts---

![hard scene break]

Gobta also heard the order as shells rained down from the sky.

"Finally... But wait, will it be okay if we left our mission incomplete?" Gobta muttered to himself.

"It should be fine, right?" Gobchi, his adjutant, replied. "Our strategy was to be persistent and let the enemy reveal their hidden hand, but at this rate, the situation will get gradually worse for us. They won't send out their top troops unless we scare them a bit."

"Really?"

"Yeah."

Gobta and Gobchi carried out their conversation amidst a battlefield that was bombarded by shells and their subsequent shock waves. Those watching them were amazed at how they could still hear each other.

Everyone took their communication abilities for granted.

"If it were up to me, I'd want the strongest people to come out first."

"Now that you mention it, Commander Gobta is one of the Four Heavenly Kings, right?"

"Wait! Even if I am one, I'm the weakest of them all... Seriously, don't remind me of it..."

Despite how this exchange sounded, Gobta, Gobchi, and the rest of the Goblin Riders were even more fired up than before.

They eagerly awaited Gobta's next orders.

Shells periodically rained down on the battlefield.

It was deliberate, and they came flying in and onto the surface with the precision of aiming at an eye^[The terminology comes from the board game Go. An "eye" is a single empty space inside a group of stones. The analogy Fuse uses is basically synonymous with a Bullseye.] on a Go board. They never intended on annihilating them with direct hits, but rather through the destructive power of shock waves.

Gobta and the others had seen through their plan and were moving to find a safe zone.

A direct hit would kill you instantly; conversely, if it missed, then you could certainly survive.

The people here were all as strong as a hundred men---the equivalent of an A-minus rank. Even if they were seriously injured, they could quickly heal themselves using potions.

As a result, Benimaru's strategy was to "feign distress".

They didn't actually have to lose, they only had to fake being panicked. In the meantime, the rest were supposed to block off the Imperial Army's path of retreat and counterattack at full force.

*If you wait until the tanks run out of ammunition, then the Empire's strongest soldiers will come to finish you off*---Benimaru had told them that as if it was a walk in the park.

*Wait a minute, please!*---Gobta wanted to complain about the unfair order.

However, Benimaru's command was absolute and could not be refuted. He was scarier than the Imperial Army.

Gobta recalled the memory of when he was informed about the operation. *Well, Benimaru-san is usually easygoing, but...he has no mercy when it comes to military affairs. And this time, it depends on keeping Rimuru-sama safe. It's impossible for someone like me to speak out against it.*

It was an uphill battle trying to persuade his men, but once Gobta mentioned Rimuru's name, they stopped complaining.

Afterwards, he wanted to overwhelm the enemy in their first push, but that seemed too good to be true. Nevertheless, as soon as the breakthrough was blocked, Gobta and his team decided to revert to their original role as decoys.

However, that was now over.

A decree from Rimuru and Benimaru's subsequent order.

There was no need to hold back.

It was time to unleash all of their strength.

<From now on, you are allowed to attack freely. Master Hakurou will be in charge of the Green Numbers, so Gobchi will lead this team.>

Gobta's expression changed as he informed his men with 'Telepathy Net'. His tone was normal, yet there was an unmistakable power behind it.

<Understood, sir. Then, what are you going to do, Corps Commander Gobta?> Gobchi asked while shrugging his shoulders.

Gobta replied with a troubled smile on his face. <We aren't playing around anymore. I don't care about the Four Heavenly Kings, but Rimuru-sama has given me an order. I can't make a fool of myself with Rimuru-sama watching! That's why I'm going to take things seriously now!>

Gobchi and the rest of the members saw a look in Gobta's eyes and knew he meant business.

They almost never got the chance to see this side of their boss.

"Heh, now you can use the power I've recognized in you without any hesitation."

<Why are you acting so high and mighty?>

<D-did you hear me?>

<Well, that's fine, but Gobto will do his best too, right?>

<Heh, of course.>

*Good grief---*Gobta breathed out with a sigh.

Gobto had been one of the earliest members of the squad and knew Gobta since the beginning. He was brilliant in his own way, but given that he absorbed a lot of extra knowledge from Rimuru regarding fashion, he tended to put on strange airs.

In the early days, he imitated his adjutant Gobchi, but now he had evolved into something entirely unique. He began carrying two longswords while donning a long black coat. Even though he hadn't mastered using the two swords, he still wielded it.

He was dressed in a way that made one wonder if he was going to be all right, but with Gobchi there, it'd probably work out. Having made that decision, Gobta turned to the person that he needed to worry about the most.

The person sitting behind Gobta was, needless to say, Testarossa.

<So, Testarossa-san. I'd like to ask you to go separately from here, is that okay?>

Testarossa gave a slight smile and nodded.

Even amidst the chaotic battlefield filled with explosions and shockwaves, she still maintained her elegant mannerisms. Her military uniform remained tidy and clean; mere soot and clouds of dust wasn't enough to dirty Testarossa.

<Oh but of course. I was thinking the same thing. Right now, I won't act as an inspector but as one of Rimuru-sama's subordinates. Everyone, try your best!>

Then Testarossa jumped down from Ranga.

After wishing them luck, she walked away from Gobta and his teammates calmly.

Rimuru initially assigned Testarossa to be Gobta's inspector, but this role was no longer needed. The dangerous demoness was on the move.

*She really is a free spirit...*

Gobta was amazed, but he didn't say anything. Part of Gobta's growth was to not do such an idiotic thing.

Once Testarossa was gone, he announced that it was their time to shine.

"So, everyone, advance forward!"

"Oooooh!"

He fired off the order to his teammates and was satisfied with their response.

Even Gobta wanted to show Rimuru how cool he was.

Gobta liked and admired Rimuru, who could be selfish and mean at times. However, he was also very kind and reliable.

Even the runty goblin Gobta was now a famous warrior. Right now was the best time to repay Rimuru's kindness.

"Gobchi, I'll rely on you for the rest!"

As he shouted, Gobta gave a signal to Ranga.

"Let's go, Ranga-san! Magic Wolf Unification!"

Ranga, who had been waiting for this moment, replied enthusiastically.

"Here I am, Gobta. I will show my lord Rimuru-sama my powers here!"

Gobta and Ranga harmonized their consciousness and released their inner magical power. Black fog shrouded the two of them.

"Let's go wild!"

"Mhm, no need to have any pity for them. Let's pull out all the stops!"

The black mist appeared to be sucked into Gobta, and a terrifying humanoid black wolf with two horns had appeared in his place.

This was what it looked like when Gobta and Ranga fused into the same 'being'. This was a true representation of the strength of the Four Heavenly Kings.

Right after seeing the fusion, the Goblin Riders under Gobchi dashed out from where they were.

"Don't get in Captain Gobta's way when he's serious!"

Gobchi tried his best to warn everyone about how dangerous Gobta was.

As if to prove his point...

Even the artillery shells shot from the tanks were smashed to the ground by the wolf's fist. Furthermore, even if a shell hit the wolf, it wouldn't cause any damage because of its hardened black fur.

Even huge artillery with tremendous amounts of destructive energy while traveling at just less than six times the speed of sound could not hurt Gobta while wearing the armor that was Ranga.

This was thanks to Ranga's Multilayer Barrier. However, to the clueless Imperial Army, it was more like a nightmare.

"What is that thing? I have never seen something like that before, not even in my dreams..."

"No, this is different! That's a real monster, a super strong monster! So the Demon Lord has something like this under him!"

There was unrest among the lower-ranking foot soldiers.

And the Armored Corps, who were trapped in their consolidated position, were in even greater peril.

When Gobta roared, "Black Lightning" fell from the sky above the tank unit. Nearly a thousand fortified tanks were the perfect target for "Black Lightning".

The black lightning strike interfered with the defensive barriers on the tanks and emitted a dazzling light. The tanks lasted for a few moments, but it seemed their electrical resistance was far from perfect.

The crew seemed to be safe, but the infantry unit, which had been in formation with the tanks as protection, suffered enormous damage.

The threat of "Black Lightning" was not just its electric current.

It was also much more powerful than natural lightning.

"Hot! This is causing serious damage to the defense system of the tanks!"

"Everyone, evacuate from the tanks immediately!"

It seemed like the electric shock caused by the lightning strike could be withstood by the soldiers, but they could not handle the heat. The tanks were much worse off.

The "Black Lightning" would bite into the inorganic tanks like a preying snake and cause significant damage to their fragile mechanical parts.

The tanks exploded one after another.

With a loud thundering noise, the tank unit became stationary.

When this happened, the tanks that were connected and fortified were nothing more than a prison. The soldiers desperately escaped from the tanks and scurried away in fear of being struck by lightning.

The Empire's disordered forces looked ridiculous.

*This wasn't too big of a deal.*

Gobta watched and laughed.

He knew that his team's powers were very effective against their enemies.

Gobta even thought that attacking the enemy's main force, which was his original purpose, would be a simple task in his current form.

Gobta looked at the wall of tanks ahead of him.

The tanks were emitting some black smoke because of Ranga's thunder.

Gobta roared without any second thought.

The roar, Voice Cannon, shattered the tank wall.

On the other side of the wall, he saw another row of tanks pointing their barrels at him.

"Enough of this bait. It's time for us to shine!"

"Yeah, our work will definitely please Rimuru-sama,"

Gobta and Ranga nodded together eagerly.

It was time to get started.

Gobta passed through the tank wall without a second thought.

He wasn't afraid of the enemies ahead of him in the slightest.

Then, he ran around the battlefield as fast as he could.

He was easily faster than the speed of sound, and the Imperial soldiers couldn't even see him with their naked eyes.

"I'll show you the result of my special training with Ranga-san! Now, let me see if you can keep up with me. Gale Wolves Dance!"

A black wind roared around the battlefield.

At the same time, a supersonic shock wave struck the Imperial tank unit.

![full page image](image2)

This shock wave also had the magical effect "Damage Storm", which would progress into a tornado, or "Damage Tornado Storm," with deliberate and precise motions that could effectively destroy enemy troops.

Gobta's terrifying anti-military annihilation technique was called the 'Gale Wolves Dance'.

With that, this side of the battlefield had collapsed.

![hard scene break]

While Gobta was invincibly driving others to the ground, something else began up in the sky.

It was the third unit that Gabil was in charge of.

.........

......

...

Gabil and his men followed Benimaru's orders and went to help Gobta. If it became dangerous for them, they would calmly move on to plan B.

In other words, they were given the same strategy as Gobta's team, which was to 'fake distress'.

Their strategy entailed the following: they would continue acting like they were losing, so that their enemies would show them their trump cards. It was a crazy strategy, but Benimaru gave the orders confidently. Gobta and Gabil agreed to carry it out calmly.

If they were actually in danger, they were permitted to withdraw. However, that was only after they helped Gobta and the others escape as well.

However, Gabil believed that worrying about this was useless. It was because Gobta, although verbally complaining, had a smile on his face.

Gabil wanted to have Gobta's insane boldness, but they still had other similar traits. Under the circumstances, he wanted to bring down the airships, if possible.

Gabil originally judged that there wouldn't be any problem if they inflicted damage upon the opponent so long as the stalemate was maintained without excessive force.

That was the idea behind the aerial battle, but their enemies turned out to be stronger than he had thought.

They blocked Gabil and his team's magic, as well as the fireballs fired by the Wyvern riders. Right now, Gabil and the others lost their advantage of a one-sided attack, which made the battle shift in favor of the Empire.

*Our goal is to draw the attention of this airship. But, if we attacked it with our full strength, we might be able to sink it...*

As long as Gabil and others had the Hiryuu as their secret attack, they could damage the enemies' airships. However, if they attacked now, then they couldn't continue with their strategy. Gabil decided to wait for the right time to pounce.

![break]

Following Benimaru's orders, he allowed his side to be attacked.

With that came another problem: the Wyvern riders lacked resistance.

Although they were elites chosen from the Blue Numbers, they had not evolved into dragonewts like Gabil and others. Their magical resistance was low enough that a large-scale magic attack would decimate them, so Gabil told the Wyvern Riders to withdraw.

"Ultima-dono, I have a request for you,"

"What?"

"We're continuing with our 'fake distress' strategy, and now we will get down to the real acting."

"Acting?"

"Yeah. Even if we keep running away, our enemies still won't relent. The best option here is to use the Hiryuu to take the brunt of the enemies' magic attacks," Gabil explained.

"Hmm... That's a very interesting plan. What's your real goal here?"

"Mmm. I've been thinking about it," Gabil replied, "but right now I think we should use our situation to acquire more resistances. We probably wouldn't even die from a direct hit. Since we have a large supply of recovery potions, I thought we might as well pretend to be seriously hit to really sell our acting, and make an endurance test while we're at it."

Ultima laughed at his speech, but the other soldiers expressed their displeasure.

"Please wait a minute, General!"

"Gabil-sama, you can be really stupid sometimes..."

"Is this really necessary now? I just wanted to say that..."

His teammates talked over him, but Gabil pretended not to hear their pleas and ignored them.

"Hm, okay! Since it sounds interesting, I'll allow it."

"I'm grateful. So then, you can retreat for now."

Inspector Ultima withdrew alongside the Wyvern Riders.

This left Gabil and the Hiryuu, who decided to perform a special attack on the airship unit.

"If you die then I will never forgive you!"

"I wish you wouldn't come up with such reckless ideas."

"This plan will get us in trouble afterwards."

Although the members acted cold, they had known Gabil for a long time. Despite their frequent complaining, they were always enthusiastic and motivated.

And thus, the magic endurance training for the Hiryuu began.

Meanwhile...

Rimuru was worried when he watched it, but after he learned the truth, he almost fainted. They would be greatly reprimanded, but some of them had expected this to happen. Even so, they decided to carry out the plan, which might be because they were influenced by general Gabil.

All in all, Gabil and the others were struck by magic cast from the airship, which dealt huge damage.

.........

......

...

And then...

Gabil heard Rimuru's 'voice'.

"Listen up, everybody! Training time is over, let's begin the carnage!"

Gabil proclaimed the orders with confidence, even though he had no idea that Rimuru was actually worried about their training.

His teammates got up excitedly, and Gabil continued enthusiastically.

![break]

"We're lucky that our weaker soldiers withdrew with Ultima-dono. Since we're the only ones left, we can afford to cut loose a little!"

Gabil's soldiers poked fun at him.

"I'd much rather fight seriously than keep doing this endurance training!"

"Yeah, yeah. Gabil-sama's been reckless like this for a long time."

Hearing this, Gabil's face turned red and he shouted,

"Quiet! Quit joking around and let's get started! Follow me and show your full potential!"

His subordinates smirked bitterly, seeing Gabil struggle to hide his embarrassment.

"You guys, stop screwing around! Let's get started quickly like Gabil-sama commanded."

"Yes, I'm not gonna disobey our general's orders."

"Yeah! Gabil-sama, we hear your order!"

Gabil heard that and gave a satisfied nod. He then glanced at the Empire's 'Air Assault Division' and proceeded to ask his men loudly,

"You guys, I ask you---who are the rulers of the sky?"

"We are, the Hiryuu!"

Gabil's aura became more serious, which prompted his soldiers to do the same.

"Exactly! Those who dare to dirty our sky must be killed. That is what Rimuru-sama wants! This is a decree from Rimuru-sama, so let's do our best! Let's fight like there's no tomorrow!"

"Yes sir!"

Gabil's order held a special significance to the Hiryuu.

That was...

"Be careful not to let your ego be consumed! Everyone, 'Dragon Body'!"

With Gabil's orders, the Hiryuu sprang into action.

'Dragon Body' was their secret power.

Their power grew overwhelmingly at the cost of losing control and inciting violence. If their ego was swallowed entirely, they would become wild beasts.

'Dragon Body' was a Skill left unused up until now because they couldn't control their thirst for destruction while using it.

Gabil had invited Midley to be an instructor to teach them how to control their power. However, the success rate was low.

Even so, they would use it.

Orders from Rimuru would always be carried out wholeheartedly.

![break]

"Dragon mode!"

![break]

The Hiryuu released their ultimate power all at once. Their muscles bulged and the purple scales that covered them turned black, making them thicker and also way more flexible. With that, they also grew two times larger. By absorbing the magicules around them, they managed to form new bodies for battle. Because of their size increase, their attack and defense power skyrocketed. Needless to say, their past selves were incomparable to how powerful they were currently.

Then came the issue of their egos...

If they lost consciousness, they would become incarnations of power. However, the Hiryuu succeeded in retaining their ego brilliantly. It was now time to display one of Tempest's strongest units, the Dragon Warriors', true powers.

"Can you guys take down the enemies one by one?"

"Yes!"

"Good, so let's go!"

With Gabil's orders, the Hiryuu immediately took action.

![break]

Who are the masters of the sky? Right now, the answer to this question was glaringly obvious. Among one of the Empire's three great armies, the Armored Corps' precious Air Assault Division was nothing more than a poor lamb for slaughter.

Why was that? It was because the dragonewt's Intrinsic Skill 'Dragon Body' had been activated. As a result, magic attacks were useless against them. Even Megiddo would not affect the 'Dragon Bodies' of Gabil and his subordinates. They had erected two barriers, 'Multilayer Barrier' and 'Natural Effects Nullification', which nullified all physical, magical, and natural attacks.

The airships' main attack used magic, and their secondary machine guns could not penetrate the scales of Gabil and the others. Prior to their strengthening, the Hiryuu had fighting abilities within the A-minus rank. Now, their power transcended the A rank.

Moreover, during the transformation, they also acquire a regenerative ability similar to 'Ultraspeed Regeneration'. This strength even surpassed that of greater majins' powers...

The airships that were unable to even hurt them now met a sad fate. As if he were rubbing salt in the Empire's wounds, Gabil shouted, "I'm going in! Time to massacre them with my power..."

Normally, Gabil was already considerably powerful. But now, he had an insane amount of magicules. He was still weaker than Shion and Benimaru, but he was as strong as Souei and Geld. He utilized his 'Dragon Body' to become a powerful warrior. His newfound strength even rivaled the ex-Demon Lords Karion and Frey.

"Vortex Crash!"

Gabil attacked one of the airships, making it fall from the sky.

![full page image](image3)

As the airflow swirled, all the moisture in the atmosphere gathered at a single point to form a magical vortex. The attack was released from Gabil's spear and pierced an airship.

The hundreds of magical barriers enacted by the airship were crushed instantly. Within seconds, the airship sank.

Although the Hiryuu could not use Vortex Crash like Gabil, they immediately charged towards the remaining airships with their strengthened bodies.

In the blink of an eye, the barriers were broken, and they stormed the ships. Five teams went in and attacked any Imperial personnel they saw. In no time, the Air Assault Division was eliminated.

Gabil shouted happily.

"Gahahahahaha!! Our siege is going great! Those who couldn't sink an airship will just have to learn from this, right?"

Upon hearing that, the Hiryuu who arrived late gave a sour face.

There were only a hundred airships. Currently, since Gabil wouldn't stop his attacks, fewer and fewer airships remained.

The battle quickly became a competition between the Hiryuu.

"This will not do, Gabil-sama!"

"Gabil-sama is easily swayed by the mood of the moment! Today, it seems like he's in a good mood, so he might not leave any prey for us!"

"Of course it's possible, since he's one of the generals..."

The speed of Gabil's attacks depended entirely on his mood. Knowing this, the members joined the assault in a hurry so they could help out.

The hunter and the prey's roles had been reversed, and the rulers of the sky had been determined.

![hard scene break]

Now let's move back a bit. The defense of the Imperial army's 'Magic Tank Division' supply unit was about to be tested.

"It is nice to see everyone following me here. Now then, prepare yourselves for a real battle!"

The man who announced that was Hakurou, the leader of the Green Numbers.

Hakurou had a cool and calm expression, but the twenty thousand soldiers that heard him were breathing heavily. After all, they were located way behind the flank of the Imperial tank unit. They had traveled over 40 kilometers, making a detour to get over here from the Dwarven Kingdom. What more, they were all wearing heavy armor...

It was only thanks to Hakurou's strenuous training that this was possible.

He had thoroughly trained the members and instilled <Battlewill>. As a result, the members were able to perform various arts such as "Instantmove" which let them move instantly, and "Formhide" which blocked the enemy's perception of themselves.

The Green Numbers had set out at the same time as Gobta and others, so they had to rush to this point so they wouldn't be discovered by their enemies.

"I'd like to commend you all for being able to use <Battlewill> so well," Hakurou said with a gentle smile.

The resting soldiers who heard that winced as if something bad would happen, holding their breath with an ominous feeling in their hearts.

They had trained hard with Hakurou for a long time, and this unflinching "teacher" treated his enemies more harshly than he treated his own people. Such a man was giving an order after complimenting them---just imagining it was terrifying. For the soldiers who understood what he had meant, they couldn't allow themselves to hear the next part without any small amount of determination.

"Our mission right now is to cut off our enemy's supplies. Although it doesn't mean much, if we destroy their backup supply unit then it will severely damage their morale. We don't need to go out of our way to kill their soldiers, but we also don't need to show mercy. Besides..."

After speaking this way, Hakurou glanced at the battlefield and smiled. He then continued,

"Gobta's performance has also turned out brilliant. He is doing very well. You guys cannot let him outshine you! Now then, go finish the battle!"

Hakurou's voice sounded even clearer and louder than the sound of explosions from far away. His speech made those without any battle experience very anxious.

"All right? Listen up, do not think about other things while fighting. The battlefield follows 'survival of the fittest'---it's kill-or-be-killed. If you let the enemy live, then your teammates will die. This is the ironbound law on the battlefield."

Their shoulders had been heaving due to their exhaustion, but before anyone knew it, they were all hanging on the end of each of Hakurou's words.

He preached his knowledge so that his determined soldiers would not hesitate later on the battlefield.

"The value of life is not created equal. Compared to the lives of our loved ones, the value of a stranger's life is meaningless. What's more, the enemies are intruders. Those fools don't even deserve to live! Slaughter them!"

Hakurou used such strong language so that his soldiers would not feel guilty while slaughtering the enemy's troops.

This was Hakurou's way of being kind.

"Prove to me that you are truly my students by cutting these iron sheds. Or do you all want to fall to the simple rocks they throw at us? If not, then do not waver! There are no enemies under our blades!"

Nobody could disagree with his challenge.

If they spoke up, then it meant that they were still "too immature" to fight on the battlefield, which would solicit glares their comrades.

There were some who were still nervous on the battlefield, but they also didn't have any problems with Hakurou.

Hakurou would never give them an order that they couldn't achieve. His words were harsh, but as a commander, he had to raise the morale of his soldiers somehow.

And just like that, the Green Numbers set their sights on the tanks. They were all waiting for Hakurou's orders---to order a surprise attack.

However, he had a lot of pressure on himself as well. He could not tarnish the reputation of the Four Heavenly Kings.

The battlefield was being watched by Hakurou's Extra Skill 'Sky Eyes'. Then, he would use 'Telepathy Net' to share it with the members of the army.

His ability was frightening. Furthermore, they were currently being outdone by the Goblin Riders led by Gobta. Everyone knew that they had to do their best.

Hakurou looked at his army and felt a bit less tense. He had trained his soldiers to be able to handle any type of situation on the battlefield. Even so, during the first battle, there would likely be casualties.

'Ah, I should have trained them more,' he thought. However, it was out of his control, and the enemies would not wait.

Benimaru's strategy was to keep Gobta and the others in a stalemate with the Empire. By doing that, the enemies would grow anxious. Since the tanks didn't have infinite ammunition, the rain of shells would also eventually end. That would be when Hakurou and his army would attack. By targeting the enemies' supply unit and cutting off their supplies, the tanks would become weaker. Another purpose was to lure the Empire's strongest fighters onto the battlefield... But the chance that they would actually come was abysmal.

*It would be great if they appeared before us.*

Hakurou wished that they would show themselves, however unlikely it was.

*This is everyone's first battlefield, and if they waver, they will die. I should attempt to make them less scared...*

Hakurou thought that all he could do now was wish for everyone's safety and for the strategy to work, but fear began to blossom in their minds.

<Listen up everybody!>

Suddenly, Rimuru's voice was transmitted using Benimaru's Skill. Just by listening to his voice, the monsters regained their confidence and became ecstatic.

<Eliminate the enemies as fast as possible,> Rimuru ordered.

Hakurou smiled bitterly.

"My worries were needless... You guys all heard our new orders, right?"

" "Yeah!" "

"Then let's destroy them! We have no need to wait anymore---go and show off your strength!"

Even before Hakurou finished talking, the monster army began running towards the supply line at full speed.

![break]

After around ten minutes had passed, a row of the Imperial foot soldiers guarding the supply unit were stormed by the monsters.

Even though the attack was sudden, the Empire had anticipated this and quickly reorganized themselves. Some troops used armored transport vehicles to fire at the monsters, which made it seem like the Empire held the advantage. However, the Green Numbers were not afraid.

Even if they were showered by bullets, the scale shields that lined the front line would protect them. Unlike bows, rifles did not form an arc with their projectiles. The point of rifles was close range combat, and unless the front row of shields was destroyed, using their rifles would be futile.

The world was still primarily in the age of swords and magic, and the introduction of firearms changed the tide of battles because of their incredible killing power. However, in a world of magic, the damage dealt by bullets was minimal to someone who could use magic. This led to swords and axes being used more than guns. Even the Empire's new weapons were inadequate to bring about a weaponry Renaissance. Since that was the case, then other weapons could be used. Hence, the Imperial commander ordered:

"Damn it! Everyone, swap out your rifles with spell guns. Maintenance team, bring our important supplies and join the main team!"

Weapons like rifles, which were recreated based on the knowledge of the Otherworlders, were useless when fighting monsters. The only situation it was useful in was against an unarmed monster. That's why the Empire switched from rifles to magic. The Empire's "spell gun", which was usable by any soldier, was engraved with the spell 'Fire Lance'.

The commander had thought that the "spell gun" would be capable of burning at least half of the monsters. Unfortunately, he was just too naive.

The Green Numbers were equipped with the latest unique-grade armor, including shields produced by Garm, made by processing Charybdis's scales. In addition to repelling bullets, they had another special effect---

"Hold your fire! Magic won't work on the opponent's army!"

---The scale shields were precious because of their high magical resistance.

It really seemed that nightmare after nightmare was befalling the Imperial army.

Then the elites of the Blue Numbers led by the Wyvern Riders and Ultima came flying towards them.

"Don't worry, just spill blood all you want!"

After Ultima's cutesy voice gave these lovely orders, the ground became engulfed in flames.

It was a fireball. Although it wasn't that powerful, it had enough strength to kill the Imperial foot soldiers.

The sound of flames also caused the Imperial soldiers to panic.

The Empire's backup, maintenance and medical soldiers were not used to actual battle, so they were unable to adapt to the chaos. As a result, the order for them to join the main unit was ignored and they became severely injured as the damage continued.

![break]

Hakurou was quite relieved to see the war's situation becoming more one-sided than what he had originally anticipated.

"Hey Hakurou-san. These are the ones I was taking care of, but I was wondering if I could leave them with you?"

"I don't mind since Miss Ultima asked nicely..."

Hakurou responded calmly. Ultima then jumped down from the back of the wyvern. His attitude towards his soldiers and other people was scarily different.

"Oh really? Then, I'll leave it to you!"

Ultima acted like a spoiled granddaughter, all cute and pleading. If Veyron or Zonda saw her, they would probably think that they were dreaming.

![full page image](image4)

They would never say that out loud, though...

"That's fine, but by the way..."

"Yeah, what is it?"

"Never mind. I was just wondering if Miss Ultima has a good relationship with Carrera-dono or not."

"Well, I'm curious why Carrera is "Dono" and I'm "Miss"...but that's okay since it's Hakurou-san. The answer is simple: It's super bad!" Ultima replied while smiling.

Her expression was cute, but the implications of her words were terrifying. Ultima was incredibly good at acting innocent. Despite that, her true nature was quite cruel. She also had mood swings so frequently that it sometimes seemed like she had multiple personalities. Even so, she still showed respect to her seniors. People like her were few and far between.

"Well, that's a shame."

"Why did you ask that?"

"It's nothing---I just wondered if you might know something about Agera, Carrera-dono's subordinate..." Hakurou trailed off.

The demon named Agera was very similar to someone that Hakurou knew. Or rather...They looked identical to each other. That person was Hakurou's grandfather and teacher, Byakuya Araki. That's why Hakurou was interested in Agera. However, the real Agera didn't even know Hakurou existed.

'It could potentially be because of his old age...' Hakurou thought.

"Um, sorry, but I'm not interested so I don't know," Ultima replied bluntly. Then she asked,

"If you're really that curious, then why don't you go ask him yourself?" She suggested the idea without much hesitation.

Upon hearing that, Hakurou nodded his head in agreement.

"I must be overthinking it then."

"Yeah, it's bad to overthink things. But let's talk about this later. Right now, we should focus on the war at hand. If we don't, Rimuru-sama will get mad at us!"

"Then I will count on your help afterwards."

Leaving with a smile, Ultima flew into the sky again.

Hakurou, who watched her fly away, had a strained face.

"Fufu, my personal matters are just a distraction from the battlefield. Well then, I must recover from this blunder as soon as possible," Hakurou unsheathed his sword and leapt onto the battlefield.

![hard scene break]

Major General Farage was shocked at what he saw in front of him. The airships were sky fortresses that prided themselves on being heavily protected by barriers managed by elite mages. And now, one of such seemingly invincible crafts had just sunk due to a single hit from a monster.

According to the Imperial intelligence agency's investigations, it appeared to be a rare species called dragonewt. They were said to have the fighting power of a humanoid dragon, but the one that was in front of him seemed on an entirely different level.

"Is that guy a monster?! Was the information that the intelligence agency sent me meaningless?!"

At first, Farage thought that they might have sent fake intelligence to get rid of mages and wizards like himself, however he reconsidered.

*No, that's not right. They changed forms right in front of me. Perhaps it's the monster metamorphosis mentioned in my teacher's book...?*

Within the monster races, there was one that could switch between a form suited for everyday life and a battle-oriented one at will.

Right now, the opponents, dragonewts, were monsters that had evolved from lizardmen. With their wings they could fly, and from their mouths they could spew jets of various elements. As B ranked monsters, they should not be underestimated, yet they weren't strong enough to be called a threat.

...However, the reality was different.

"What happened?" Farage asked his lieutenant.

The lieutenant also appeared confused by the disparity between the intel they were given and what was happening before them.

"S-sorry. According to the report from the staff who measured the energy output of the enemy monsters, they transformed, and as they changed, their energy skyrocketed. He confirmed that it surpassed that of standard A rank several times over!"

"What, you mean...several times over rank A?! And are you also trying to say that they are also fully immune against magic?!"

Farage shouted, but that thought wasn't quite right. Although Gabil and his soldiers had a high 'Magic Resistance,' they didn't possess 'Magic Nullification'. It's just that the magical attacks from the airships weren't powerful enough to break through the 'Multilayer Barrier' that protected them.

"I don't want to admit it, but looking at the situation, it's the only possible explanation. Our magical attacks aren't working, but these monsters are attacking and bringing our airships, our pride, to the ground."

*You don't need to tell me, I can see it,* Farage thought, barely able to bite his tongue and get a grip.

*They only have around a hundred dragonewts, we shouldn't be scared of that, no matter how great their weapons are, they are no match for ours,* he thought.

*We will definitely win the moment the 300 wyverns flee...no*.---The truth was, Farage felt uneasy. Backed by his long military experience, he had an unpleasant premonition.

*My intuition was right, huh? However, what I need to do first is to think of a solution.* With that thought in mind, Farage glanced at the battlefield once more.

"Growing several times over in strength; so, that means that those dragonewts are as strong as greater majins. They are Hazard-class---no, I think it's safe to think that they are equal to Calamity-class at worst, right?"

"Yes sir! That's what I heard from the analysis unit."

"How annoying. Even A-ranked monsters could be dealt with had magic worked against them. So, what about the lead individual?"

"Th-That's..."

"What is it? Speak up!"

"Yes! Here is the report!"

The lieutenant faltered at the report but resumed under Farage's order. Farage was speechless at its content.

"Ten times stronger? Is this true?"

"Yes. The testing device didn't raise any errors, so we can confirm that this individual has ten times more energy than the other monsters."

"Crazy..."

Farage didn't know what to say next.

Even his teacher, the repeatedly reincarnating Gadra, couldn't have that much magical energy. That amount was comparable to a demon lord.

"Even the information bureau didn't have the information about that monster, which means that it didn't participate in the tournament held in the monster country."

"According to rumors, it seems that he was holding a scientific conference about medicinal herbs. Now that I think about it, it must have been a ruse to hide a Disaster-class force."

*Oh, so that's why*, Farage thought after hearing the lieutenant's explanations.

That previous phenomenon was indeed 'transformation'.

It hid its power and let its enemy underestimate them. After confirming the airships only had magic for offense, it showed its true nature.

*We've been taken for fools.*

"Calm down, everyone. The opponent is a monster, meaning our victory is assured. No matter what kind of opponent, it's fine as long as we activate the magic canceler and neutralize their moves!"

Dragonewts were a rare species. Although they had gotten stronger after transforming, they could still be defeated. The airship was a secret weapon made by the Empire to beat Veldora. By using its true weapon, the 'magic canceler', even True Dragons would be forced to cower before them.

Even now, the magic canceler was still in operation. It had a wide range of effect, reaching down to the ground. However, this was more of a trial run and was supposed to be used for the battle against Veldora.

Disrupting the magicules that monsters were made of could slow them down, and irradiating them with a focused beam could immobilize them entirely.

"Begin immediately!"

As his lieutenants scrambled into action, Farage tried his best to grasp the situation on the battlefield. Excluding the leading enemy, the other dragons worked in teams of five. At the moment, there were twenty ships engaged and less than ten had sunk.

The damage was still recoverable.

"Major General Farage, the device's preparations are completed. However, if we proceed, we will be getting our allies involved as well..."

"So?"

"No...nothing..."

"Then get on with it."

"Yessir!"

What would happen if an airship using magic to fly were to get hit by a magic canceler? Needless to say, without magic, the airship would yield to gravity's pull. And of course, the crewmates would not survive. This meant that Farage's colleagues from the magic corps would be sacrificed. Even so, he didn't bat an eye when he gave the order.

"Begin using the magic canceler!"

The remaining ships moved to surround the airships engaging Gabil. One after another, they blasted magic cancelling radiation from the ship's bows. Due to this, both dragonewts and the airships began falling.

*Sorry, this is a necessary sacrifice...*

Farage opened his eyes and prayed to himself.

The airships fell to the ground and exploded on impact. Neither the crew nor the monsters could have survived it.

"We've done it. We're only left with the enemy's leader."

"Even if he isn't affected by the magical effects, he won't be able to resist the shockwaves and heat."

"Although it required a tremendous sacrifice, hundreds of greater majins paid the price; the act wasn't in vain."

A sense of relief washed over the lieutenants.

"Don't let your guard down," Farage snapped, bringing them back to reality. "Victory attained by sacrificing our own soldiers is nothing to be proud of. Also, we're not done yet with this individual!!"

The lieutenants braced themselves when they heard this. Even the demon-lord-ranked individual was becoming immobilized. But his wings were still intact, and he was still flying. With more than twenty ships sacrificed, it would be unacceptable to let the enemy slip away.

"If only we were up against Gobta from the Four Heavenly Kings, who can't fly. We wouldn't have had such trouble."

"Yeah. Had Gaster-dono's tank unit cooperated with us, even the greatest defense would have collapsed."

"However, he is unable to move due to the magic canceler. If we continue to irradiate him, his body will soon collapse, right?"

"No, we can't be sure about that. The analysis team reported that his energy level is decreasing at an insignificant rate."

Upon hearing the lieutenants' discussions, Farage suddenly felt a chill go down his spine.

*Even with more than seventeen airships use the magic canceler, that could only stop his movements?! Doesn't that mean that even the weakening effect doesn't apply to him?!*

While pondering this ridiculous situation, Farage felt that he needed to revise his tactics. He understood that this monster's strength was beyond what he imagined. It had taken the combined strength of all the magic cancelers to finally stop him from moving. With some time, it would even be possible to weaken him, but it was surprising to see that such a being, other than Veldora, could even exist.

*That monster is stronger than Gobta of the Four Heavenly Kings Wait, could it be?!*

In that moment, a thought suddenly crossed Farage's mind.

That monster *was* their target, Veldora.

Farage had convinced himself.

"Oh, so that monster *is* Veldora. If that is the case, this extreme amount of energy makes sense," he muttered to himself as the realization kicked in.

The lieutenants who heard him had various reactions.

"Oh, so that's why... He just got unsealed and is too weak to maintain his dragon form."

"Weakened? He's this powerful and you call that weakened? Even his underlings are on par with dragons. Some of them even reached the power of an archdragon, right?" Farage scolded the lieutenants.

"Yeah. That's the true terror of Veldora. A long time ago, the Imperial army lost to him. That's what my master Gadra taught me. Even after being sealed for about three centuries, he still takes pride in his power. You can't imagine how strong he was before it got sealed, can you?"

After listening to Farage's explanation, the lieutenants nodded their heads in agreement.

"It is true that with such power, Farmus's army wouldn't stand a chance."

"Major General Farage must be right; this monster has to be Veldora."

Half of the crew agreed but some of them raised doubts.

"Excuse me, Major General Farage. Based on the intel, the dragonewt leader should be called 'Gabil,' correct?"

"That's obviously a fake name," Farage replied with a smirk. "He's been weakened ever since he was unsealed, so he just used a different name to keep a low profile before recovering his full power."

The lieutenant had no choice but to back down at Farage's explanation.

"A monster with a made-up name...that's unheard of. Then again, I would expect nothing less of Veldora himself."

The hypothesis was full of holes, but nevertheless, it's what they chose to believe. The crewmates' faces lightened up after learning that they were confronting Veldora.

"We may have lost about one third of our airships, but considering we are up against Veldora, it's to be expected!"

"We can even consider ourselves lucky. Remember that he wiped out the army of Farmus with devastating attacks. We were right to quickly use the magic cancelers and seal his movements."

*That's right*, Farage thought. *Veldora is trapped in the magic canceler's rays and is unable to move. He will eventually run out of energy, and we'll be able to kill him with ease.*

It suddenly hit him: he had managed to snatch the greatest trophy of this war. Farage savored this luck.

"Is the magic canceler's output stable?"

"No problems, the output is stable at 80 percent."

"How long until it reaches maximum output?"

"It will take less than an hour. Right now, it is only enough to stop his movements, but soon Veldora's body will begin collapsing."

"Yes. Veldora now only has one hour to live. During this time, Gaster-dono will surely achieve ground supremacy."

The lieutenants flew into high gear. Without saying anything, they knew what Farage wanted and communicated to the analysis team. Then they reviewed the plan and identified any issues. It was concluded that the Four Heavenly Kings' Gobta would be subdued within an hour. Gobta combined with a demon wolf and became a powerful individual but was still inferior to Veldora. If Gaster's tank unit was serious and used its real strength, he would quickly be overwhelmed.

"We were up against Veldora and his underlings, so our magic attacks failing couldn't be helped. However, the goddess of victory is smiling upon us! If we merely hold our ground, the Empire's long-standing wish will be fulfilled!"

Farage deeply believed this and cheered up the soldiers.

![hard scene break]

An atmosphere of imminent triumph permeated the bridge.

"Let's bring out the wine."

"Good idea. Get that vintage, four-hundred-year-old bottle from the collection."

"It's a dreamy escape to celebrate avenging the humiliation of the empire. Within an hour, the sediments will have settled in the bottle."

"Ok, leave it to me."

"---Can I have some as well?"

Before anyone realized it, a beautiful girl with long bluish-purple hair tied in a side ponytail was sitting in the lieutenant's seat next to Farage.

*Hey, when did she arrive?! No, rather, before asking that*...

She was wearing a military uniform which didn't suit her age. However, this formal-looking uniform emphasized her cute look.

Farage regretted his overconfidence. He had been so sure of his victory, that he had let his guard down. The same could be said for his lieutenants, who were relaxing nearby.

The girl must have invaded easily because of this.

"Hey, who are you?"

How had she gotten in here?

And what was her goal?

Was she an ally or an enemy? She had to be an enemy.

"What, is it no good?" the girl unexpectedly replied, in a meek tone. "Then I would like tea, please. I've been observing you guys for so long that I got thirsty."

Hearing Farage's interjection, the crew on the bridges turned their heads and widened their eyes in astonishment upon noticing the girl.

There should've been barriers both inside and outside the airship. However, they hadn't raised any alerts.

That girl had the most natural look on her face.

"I'm asking you who you are!"

Farage slowly stood up and walked towards the girl, then asked again while taking out his gun. Even so, the girl kept on laughing. She didn't seem the slightest bit threatened while peeking down the barrel of the gun.

Who exactly was she?

"You're asking who I am? My name is Ultima. This precious name was given to me by Rimuru-sama!"

She was one of the world's strongest beings, the Violet Primordial.

Farage carefully observed Ultima and tried to gauge her strength. He figured he could coax a bit of information out of her through conversation.

"Ultima? Doesn't ring a bell."

"Oh, that just means that you're ignorant. I came here to interrogate you guys, but I guess I shouldn't have expected much."

"What are you talking about?"

"You'll be dead soon, didn't you know? So, I want you to give me as much information as you can," Ultima said with an innocent smile.

Ultima's attitude sparked a strange feeling in his gut. For example: From her, he felt the same kind of pressure as he did when speaking to the high-ranked Imperial Guardians.

*Could it be that she is trying to overpower me? Am I getting frightened by her?!*

Farage began to doubt his own skills. However, the real problem was that this girl sitting right in front of him, Ultima, had managed to sneak into the airship by herself. That was reason enough to be alarmed.

He suddenly realized why she was here; it was plainly obvious.

It was because of Veldora, the dragon that was trapped outside the airship. The sight of the symbol of the Empire's victory must have been despairing for the monsters. Some underlings would surely move to rescue him.

*Ultima? She must be a terrifying monster if even the Intelligence Bureau doesn't know about her. She must be an executive under Veldora, a trump card.*

She must have been a recently appointed executive. She looked no different than a human, but that evil aura was hard to mistake. Fortunately, Farage had an idea of what kind of demon could exert such an evil aura, even if her true identity was unknown.

The reason was that Gadra, Farage's teacher, was a renowned researcher on this subject.

He pointed his gun at Ultima and asked, "I know what you are. A demon, right?"

"Whoa, that's impressive. You're correct."

*Of course I am*, he snickered. Such an evil monster had to be an archdemon. On top of that, she was incarnated into a body and had a name.

The problem was Ultima's class.

*She's definitely among the nobility. If she is a medieval one, it shouldn't be that hard to deal with her---but any older than that, like the ancient ones, would be a tough fight. In that case, I'll seal her Skills. Demons without magic are nothing to be afraid of!*

With this in mind, Farage secretly gave an order to his subordinates. He ordered the use of the magic cancelers on his airship. That would mean that the magic strengthening rifles would be unusable and that spell guns wouldn't work either, leaving the aircraft's magicians useless.

However, that was Farage's aim.

Monsters were no longer a threat if you sealed their magicules. The same went for demons. They wouldn't be able to use their prized magic if they couldn't use magicules.

When fighting against an archdemon, the number of magicians fighting alongside you was irrelevant. Rather, it was better to create a situation of absolute superiority over the demon to increase the chances of winning.

While Farage continued brandishing his gun, he carefully placed his hand on the saber he kept at his waist. He continued his conversation, hoping to keep Ultima's attention.

"It is surprising to see that Veldora has such a subordinate."

"Huh? Veldora-sama's?"

"Kukuku, there is no need to play dumb. Considering the situation, I can't think of any other reasons for you to come here other than trying to save your lord!"

"What do you mean? I am Rimuru-sama's loyal subordinate!"

*Demon Lord Rimuru's subordinate? No, her goal is to rescue Veldora, right?*

The reports had never mentioned Veldora having any subordinates. But it didn't matter whether that demon was working for the demon lord or the dragon.

"That was rude. So, you are here to save Veldora, right?"

"What are you talking about? I told you that I've come to interrogate you about various things. Are you even listening to me?"

It seems that they were unable to reach an understanding.

*Bluffing, eh? There's no point trying to hide it, but I wonder what her intention is...*

Farage became anxious, realizing that he might be misunderstanding something. No, rather, it felt more like he was making a huge mistake.

"...So, what do you want to know?"

Ultima's face lit up with a smile, as if she'd been waiting for him to ask. Then with a smile on her face, she asked.

"I want to know how this ship works and how to operate it. Also, tell me what forces you have left in the Empire," she said, grinning. "Tell me everything you know about them; how strong they are."

Farage felt particularly humiliated by her innocent attitude.

*It is good timing for my side to experience this. Yeah, I admit that this is kind of bad luck but-what can a person do?*

He began to feel genuinely worried.

The preparations were almost finished.

It was the trump card against the demon.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the signal that it was ready.

Victory was definitely coming. Farage regained his composure.

"Kukuku, do you really think I would gladly tell you these things??"

"I didn't think so, but that doesn't really matter. Anyway, is the tea ready? I've been waiting for ages."

"I will give you something way better than tea!"

Shaking off his hesitation, Farage pulled the trigger. The shot signaled the start of the battle.

The airship went under the influence of the magic canceler.

![break]

Farage's gun wasn't a spell gun. It was a military semi-automatic pistol developed by the Colt Firearm firm from the United States. The Colt M1911. It was an antique brought by an otherworlder and was Farage's favorite item which he carefully maintained every day.

It was loaded with seven plus one rounds and used an especially large caliber, manufactured at great expense. It packed a hefty punch, leading many to call it a hand cannon.

However, it was just a bluff. A conventional weapon was useless against a demon, which was a spiritual being. An incarnated demon might feel a little sting but that was about it.

With a deft movement, Farage released the safety and fired all of his bullets. He wasn't optimistic about this. After all, pissing off an archdemon was a suicidal act.

As the bangs subsided, his doubts were confirmed.

Without getting up from her chair, Ultima opened her left hand and dropped the eight bullets on the floor.

He didn't understand how she did it without magic. The bullet's kinetic energy was nullified and there wasn't even a scratch on Ultima's hands.

"What a fun toy. However, I prefer Rimuru-sama's."

"No way. That was my favorite..."

This wasn't the outcome he expected, but he wasn't entirely shocked, either. He holstered his gun and pulled out his saber.

The "Imperial Magic Saber" worked even under the Magic Canceler. By infusing his own power and circulating the magicules, it had the same effect as a magic sword, which was more powerful than an Aura Sword.

A magic sword was effective against demons. And if you destroyed their body, then they wouldn't be able to withstand the effects of the magic canceler, he thought.

*I'll banish you to the underworld!*

Farage was a wizard and at the same time a brilliant swordsman. He didn't flaunt it, but he was proud to be as good as other famous sword fighters.

That's why he could afford to be calm when his magic was sealed.

Ultima also acted unconcerned, as if she weren't even influenced by the Magic Canceler.

Farage believed that she was just showing forbearance out of pride and that he shouldn't get fooled by her performance.

"How do you feel now? Being unable to use your magic?"

"Huh?"

Ultima tilted her head, puzzled.

"Kukuku. Are you getting anxious? This chat is over, demon!"

The atmosphere surrounding Farage changed, and an invisible thread of tension was stretched between him and Ultima.

"Huh. You're not up for it, then?" she asked.

"Of course, who would be stupid enough to negotiate with demons?"

"Stupid? Hey, are you referring to me?"

"Idiot, is your skull too thick? Well then, you wanted to know the Empire's elite soldiers, learn that I'm one of them!"

Farage watched for Ultima's chance to speak as he thrust towards her.

A professional stabbing technique. A deadly blow aimed at Ultima's heart. One that even majins couldn't avoid. Except for...

"I will kill you last."

Farage heard a voice coming from his back. Farage's deadly blow not only failed to touch Ultima, who was supposed to be sitting on the chair, but it also left a hole in the seat. As impossible as it may seem, Ultima had slipped behind him. He couldn't believe it.

"It's fine if you're not interested in a conversation. But you still have to answer my questions. Don't worry, you don't need to talk, I can get the answers on my own."

Ultima looked around at the soldiers with an innocent smile. Then she began speaking in a hideous tone.

"Well, I will start with you."

"What?"

Farage turned around in panic when a round object whizzed past him. It slammed against the wall, leaving behind a big splotch---that 'thing' being a human head.

One of the lieutenants, who had just lost everything up above his neck, then collapsed to the floor, convulsing.

"What the---?!"

"He didn't know anything, so I guess I'll keep going."

While saying that, Ultima continued to randomly behead enemy soldiers, tampering with them for a few seconds before discarding them.

As the number of victims increased, the airship transformed into a hell of screams and fear.

"Ma-maximize the magic canceler's output! Contact the other ships and order them to shoot at this one!" Farage shouted, snapping the panicked magicians back into reality.

The soldiers hurriedly followed the order.

"Is that magic canceler one of your newest weapons? It seems like it works by shooting disruption rays that scatter the movement of magicules so that spells get cancelled. Sure, it works on monsters, but did you really think it'd work on me?" Ultima muttered, tilting her head like a puppy.

"It's a bluff!" Farage shouted, "You think you can bluff your way out of this?"

"Hmm, you don't understand. If we were talking about a monster whose body is made up of magicules, it'd undoubtedly be super effective. But don't you think that you're just wasting your effort with incarnated demons like me?"

"What...?"

"Besides, what's the point of using that against a higher being? As long as we're conscious, magic comes to us as naturally as you breathe. Observe."

As soon as Ultima said that, her figure disappeared. At the same time, the head of the communications officer, sitting in the last row, shot into the air. It was done by Ultima, who moved there instantly.

"See? Just now I moved and sent this guy's head flying. I went faster than sound but there was no shockwave, right? It's because I used magic and..."

Ultima flicked her wrist and her fingertips seemed to blur for a moment. Immediately, the head of the second in command, standing next to Farage, burst with a bang.

"It's easy to create this kind of shockwave using the laws of physics, isn't it?"

Ultima spoke with an innocent tone while committing such atrocities. She didn't feel the slightest shred of guilt.

"How come..." Farage muttered to himself.

Ultima's words finally reached his mind. The common sense he had cultivated over the years got in the way of his understanding of the situation. It was a strange experience, as if she were speaking a foreign language, from some far away country. The truth was that he *refused* to understand it.

Were archdemons really like that?

Farage was still pondering Ultima's identity.

She should've been on par with an archdemon. Had she been a newborn demon, he would've been able to defeat her handily. Although he couldn't defeat ancient species or even older beings, he could've put up a good fight, if not win, against a viscount class or lower.

So, what was this current situation?

The magic canceler, that could even seal Veldora, turned out to be completely useless. The named archdemon, who called herself Ultima, was unusually strong, even when knowing she incarnated. Her power defied Farage's common sense. He realized that no matter how hard he struggled, he couldn't beat Ultima. That's why he was willing to use his trump card against the demon.

"Don't get cocky you demon! "Spirit Summoning: Ifrit." Greater fire spirit, come forth!!"

This was the strongest summoning magic only available to heroes. Farage initially couldn't pull it off by himself. But the ship's magic-enhancing cannons and the presence of fifty mages made it possible. Additionally, spirits were barely affected by the magic canceler, so the summoning went unhindered.

An Ifrit, a fire giant, manifested and destroyed the bridge on the spot. Spirits had a natural advantage against demons. So, a greater spirit should be able to win against any archdemon. Farage was sure of himself and shouted at Ultima, "I'll admit that you are a monster. However, we have been extensively researching demons, that's why we are fully prepared for this kind of situation. Too bad for you, now meet your doom!!"

Ultima continued to smile as she listened to Farage's words.

It was at this time Farage learnt how frightening a smile could be.

*Impossible. It can't be. There is no way she can defeat Ifrit...*

The Ifrit summoned by Farage was powered up by fifty magicians through the magic enhancing cannons. Naturally, its power was several times higher than the usual greater spirits. No matter the class of the demon, be it an ancient or prehistoric species, it couldn't be defeated by an archdemon.

Even so, Farage still couldn't stop his nagging fear.

"Don't get so carried away by summoning a weak and useless thing. It would have been best for you to speak while I was still smiling. Now, I'll bring you despair."

*Ah, we're done for.* It slowly dawned on Farage, he could feel it.

And his intuition was right.

The next moment, Ifrit, the embodiment of power, froze and shattered in front of Farage and his subordinates.

It was caused by the elemental magic 'Frozen Hell' that Ultima used without being noticed.

"Ah..."

"What?! It's a monster!"

"What the hell!! What the hell is that?!"

Fools wept and wailed before the river of sorrow. They were all terrified.

This was a natural reaction because before their eyes stood the very embodiment of death.

"Well then, let's resume the interrogation!"

Ultima's cheerful voice was the last thing heard by those unlucky souls.

![break]

A few minutes later, Ultima nodded with a big smile on her face.

She was happy to have gathered all the information she wanted. It should be impossible to steal all of someone's knowledge, but for Ultima it was a piece of cake to read people's brain waves.

Ultima was a military attaché, and bringing back information was part of her mission. If the results were satisfactory, her master, Rimuru, would be pleased.

*I would be happy with a compliment*, Ultima thought.

She then glanced at the sole survivor, Farage. He was the only one whom Ultima ignored during the massacre. Of course, it was on purpose.

"You called me a fool; this deserves the greatest fear. If you try hard enough, you will survive, so give it your best," Ultima whispered and began casting her magic.

A fist-sized black fire started growing in Ultima's right palm.

"A-a-ah..."

Farage knew this magic.

It was an Abyss Core, an uncontrollable hellfire created after casting a specific chain of spells. The ultimate magic, said to lie beyond the grasp of human hands.

Except that wasn't the whole story, because unbeknownst to Farage, some humans could control it. The heroes of humanity, the Seven Luminary Clerics, had achieved that feat with three of them working together.

However, the Abyss Core produced by Ultima was an order of magnitude larger than the one produced by the Seven Luminaries. Even Farage who wasn't aware of this fact could recognize it as a strategic threat.

Ultima tossed it with a casual flick.

"Then, take care. Bye bye!" she said right before she left.

![break]

Farage was stunned and stood up. The mystery over Ultima's identity no longer mattered to him anymore. He realized that the end of his life was in sight as soon as he laid eyes on the Abyss Core. He understood that he couldn't stop it. And that was true. Farage's powers were all meaningless.

As if to ridicule his efforts, the fire that left Ultima's control expanded and spread everywhere. Shortly after Ultima took off, a black fireball swallowed the entire flagship and exploded.

Turning into the ultimate destruction magic---the nuclear magic Nuclear Flame.

And Farage, the last man on board, could only whisper,

"How beautiful...this is the pinnacle of magic..."

With an ecstatic expression on his face, his body burned, swallowed up by the black flame. His body was reduced to atoms and his soul experienced the pain of being burned alive.

*Master Gadra, have you ever experienced such a miracle?*

'No, that's not possible'---Farage asserted.

He understood that the magic interference of the magic canceler was useless if dominated by stronger thought waves. As proof, this beautiful magic of destruction served him endless despair. His life ended in misery, but it was also by the blessing of being surrounded by the quintessence of magic.

![break]

Farage's Air Assault Division was completely obliterated by the Nuclear Flame. The super-heated flames caused primary damage and were followed up with shockwaves from the explosion. The flagship was vaporized by the extreme heat.

The ships in the vicinity were also blown to bits, turning their hulls into deadly shrapnel. The fragments tore through the air at hypersonic speeds, devastating the surrounding area. This enormous explosion sealed the Empire's fate. Only the first airship to fall to the ground remained intact. All others that remained in the air got caught up in the chain of explosions.

Thus, the Empire's trump card, the Air Assault Division, was defeated in humiliating fashion, ending in complete annihilation, without ever engaging Veldora.

![hard scene break]

Ultima lost interest in Farage as she took off from the flagship. Seeing the swelling fireball, she nodded in satisfaction. She remembered Rimuru's order to do her best, and wondered if she should have increased the power a little, but the realized that she would have killed all of the Hiryuu members on the ground had she done that. So, in that regard, she figured she had done the right thing.

A big tragedy had happened in the air, but none of the Hiryuu were hurt.

No, actually, some people had failed to meet the quota and later suffered the consequences...but that was none of Ultima's business.

She was more concerned about Gabil's behavior.

"Gabil-san, what were you doing a while ago...?"

For some reason, he had been mistaken for Veldora when he was trapped by the magic canceler, but that didn't matter to Ultima. She wanted the squad to evacuate quickly to not get caught up in the Nuclear Flame.

Ultima flew to Gabil, which was a hassle, but it couldn't be helped.

"Hold on a minute, Gabil-san, just what were you doing a while ago?"

"Oh, Ultima-dono! Actually, I gained a new sensation."

Gabil, for some reason, proudly answered Ultima's question. She was curious about that, but evacuation was the main priority. Ultima herself wouldn't die from her magic, but Gabil wouldn't be able to withstand the damage. He might survive, but she didn't want to take any chances. To avoid adding friendly fire to her record, she forced Gabil to evacuate with her.

![break]

The Hiryuu gathered together on the ground. Finally, it was time for Ultima to deliver her assessment.

"So, what the hell was that?" she demanded in a stiff tone.

Apart from her role as military attaché, Ultima was tasked to monitor Gabil's actions as an inspector general. She must not only support him, but also advise him not to take any wrong actions. Gabil's failures were Ultima's failures. It was no wonder she was being harsh with him. He, on the other hand, seemed to have missed the memo.

"Gwahahaha!" he laughed. "Actually, while I was getting blasted by the enemy's special rays, I discovered that they specifically affected magicules. So, I thought it would be interesting to experiment and see how much I could endure."

*Rimuru-sama better scold this lizard,* Ultima thought, barely managing to hold her tongue while she continued listening to his story.

"So, just what is this *new sensation*?"

"Oh, that's right! Listen carefully, you guys. With regards to our Intrinsic Skill 'Dragon Body', Midley-dono said that the more we were used to it, the longer we could use this Skill. And in fact, I remained transformed for a long time, didn't I?"

Gabil spoke with a smug look on his face, looking around at his friends.

The Hiryuu who heard it looked at each other with surprise. Their transformation only lasted a dozen minutes on average and they had all returned to their original form by now.

"I thought it came down to Gabil-sama's talent, but I guess there was more to it."

"Then, can we do it too, if we know the secret?"

Gabil's subordinates started chattering among themselves.

Ultima's eyes turned deadpan as she watched the dragonewt's excitement. She wished the most painful experiences upon these lizards. Ultima gave no mercy to her enemies, and she never held herself back when treating her subordinates. But strictly speaking, Gabil and his army weren't her subordinates. She would anger her master if she treated them the way she wanted. Best case scenario, he would only get a little angry...but remembering how furious Rimuru was when his subordinates were hurt, there was a good chance that the punishment would be particularly harsh---worst case scenario, she would face exile.

Ultima couldn't bear that thought. Weighing the stress relief and the punishment, she chose to endure this with tears in her eyes.

Gabil then called out to Ultima.

"It's all thanks to Ultima-dono that I discovered the secret of this power, because she believed I had this idea, she went and bought me time."

"Huh?"

"Hmph, there's no need to hide the obvious, this Gabil here can see through it. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to grow!"

That being said, Ultima didn't feel too bad. She regained her composure and slightly raised Gabil's rating in her mind.

"Ok that's enough," Ultima cut in. "By the way, Gabil-san, what did you find out? Everyone seems to want to know about it."

Ultima stopped trying to correct Gabil's misunderstanding. Now she had decided that it was more important to get the situation under control.

At this point, the battle operations had become localized.

There were three locations: The rear under Hakurou's command, the center where Gobta & Ranga rampaged, and the enemy headquarters where Testarossa was heading.

Now that Gabil and his team had completed the extermination of the air force they were tasked with, they had to provide assistance on the other divisions. There was no time to dilly dally.

"I'll report this to Rimuru-sama as well, but first, let's keep it simple. It's going to increase your strength, so you guys should listen carefully."

After that, Gabil began to explain with a serious expression.

It was about the complete control of 'Dragon Body'.

This Intrinsic Skill of the dragonewts was a special Skill that granted strength with an outburst of magicules. The runaway magicules would take in surrounding substances and strengthen the user's body. By increasing one's mass, one would enhance their defensive power and heal their injuries instantly. Magic would be unusable because of the rampant magicules, but using Skills such as 'Breath' wouldn't be a problem. It was a wonderful power that was continuously strengthened as long as one was safe.

"And it seems that the enemy's attack effectively disrupts the movement of magicules. I felt that my power was being further strengthened under their fire."

"That is to say...stronger than you are now?"

Even Ultima was shocked by the unexpected effects of the magic canceler. Gabil currently had a magicule capacity comparable to that of Clayman's pseudo awakening. If he could get even stronger, then his words would be worth listening to. It was no wonder that Ultima was surprised to hear that just letting the magicules run wild would increase their power and that it could even exceed an awakened demon lord---True Demon Lord---by numbers alone.

But alas, that was too good to be true.

"No, it's not that. My power increased, but I couldn't handle it well. That's why I was concentrating on feeling the rampaging magicules in my body. But---"

The result was that he became unable to move.

Even though he remained unharmed, Gabil was completely immobile. With nothing to lose and nothing else to do, he learned how to feel the magicules.

"As Midley-dono told me, it's a 'state of selflessness.' Look into your inner universe and listen to its voice."

"Stop rambling and get to the point!" Ultima snapped, with agreement coming from Gabil's men.

"Ah, yes," Gabil nodded, feeling the pressure.

"In short, by feeling the magicules' violent rampage, I was able to send a 'thought' to it. That's how you can control your powers."

Murmurs of doubt started spreading among Gabil's troupe.

Ultima, on the other hand, pondered. After looking at Gabil and his men, she realized that what was as easy as breathing for her could be an insurmountable task for them. This thought got her hooked on the subject.

*Hmm? Meaning that If I train them, perhaps Gabil-san's subordinates could become even stronger?*

If that were possible, it would be a significant help to her lord. And if she could pull it off, there was a high chance she would receive praise.

"I understand what Gabil-san is saying, but let's save this talk for later. Right now, I think it's better to provide support to Gobta-kun's corps."

With that, Ultima declared the break to be over. She had initially planned to report that Gabil was slacking off, but since he had given her useful information, she decided to respond with kindness. Just this once, she decided to overlook Gabil's shenanigans.

"Yeah, that's right! Let's head out to support the other corps."

Gabil happily nodded.

This was a complete misunderstanding, but from Ultima's point of view, there was no problem. It was more convenient to leave it like that without saying anything.

"If you don't meet your quotas, be prepared for re-education later!"

"Yeah. I'll help you with that!"

Ultima cutely smiled, thinking that this was a very good idea.

Gabil and his corps went back to the battlefield, unaware of Ultima's intentions.

![hard scene break]

"This is ridiculous, I've never seen such a ridiculous thing before!"

At the troop headquarters, far from the battlefield, Lieutenant General Gaster shouted with a grimace.

An unbelievable and terrible spectacle was unfolded before his eyes.

His pride, the Magic Tank Division, was being toyed with by a man-shaped monster wolf.

It was a scene that looked like it came out of a nightmare. There was no denying that there were already more tanks destroyed.

He had already known that defeat was imminent at this point in time, but the pace of the battle was faster than he had expected, and so he had missed the timing to withdraw. He couldn't even report the situation to Calgurio, who was the corps commander of the Armored Corps as well as the commander-in-chief.

*I have to report this to Calgurio as soon as possible and get permission to withdraw...* Gaster's reasoning appealed. *But...*

Even if he reported, it would be denied.

The main unit led by Calgurio was already in operation. If Gaster's side withdrew, then the main unit would be isolated.

The main unit, the 'Augmented Legion,' was deployed in front of Demon Lord Rimuru's base. These soldiers were the pride of the Empire, each of whom had undergone modifications, and had an overwhelming force of 700,000. Even the main unit, which was sure to triumph, would not be able to escape unrest should they know that the soldiers succeeding them had withdrawn.

The Dwarven Kingdom army had also made its move. In that case, they would be caught in a pincer attack with that army and Demon Lord Rimuru's forces. That meant the supply line would be cut off.

Even without sleeping or eating, the Augmented Legion could operate for about a week. But that was the limit. As long as you were human, a supply line was absolutely necessary.

*My mission is to conquer the Dwarven Kingdom... If we withdraw from this battlefield, we will abandon Calgurio and the others. Even if we can't win, we have to at least keep the deadlock.*

But that was a tough call.

All Gaster could see was his army's defeat.

Confusion had also occurred in the rear, and the chain of command was disrupted. Friendly fire was starting to occur. At this rate, it was only a matter of time before they got annihilated.

"Lieutenant General Gaster! If this goes on, we will be destroyed either way!"

"We need to withdraw, please give the order!"

Gaster needed not to hear his men's advice as he also thought the same. However, to say it out loud would mean that the responsibility for defeat would rest on him.

This man called Lieutenant General Gaster had a good reputation within the army, as well as a good personal valor. He was not used to such a situation because he had never experienced such a setback before.

*We cannot withdraw. If we do such a thing, I will be executed by His Majesty. I can never allow that! I will become a champion. Yet, my chance to achieve that will be gone. At the very least, I must find a just reason as to why it is not my fault, or else...*

The strategy in which the prestige of the Empire was on the line would end in failure because of him---this thought unmasked Gaster's true character. He thought only of his own self and did not care about sacrificing his men. Gaster was that kind of a lowlife.

"Lieutenant General, if this continues, it will be difficult to even regroup the troops."

"It is not a shame to retreat. If we let this confused battle continue, it will only worsen the damage to our allies."

After receiving such a proposal, Gaster finally began to think. Either way, he would not be able to escape punishment if he lost the troops he was entrusted with. Far from demotion, even his life would be taken without trial.

"Shit! I'm a man who will become a champion. And yet... Everyone's getting in my way, these incompetent, unhelpful bastards!"

Gaster cursed, fully revealing his ugly nature.

At that moment, there was a loud explosion that drowned out Gaster's voice. This threw the people in the headquarters into confusion.

"What's going on?!"

"I-it is an attack by an enemy's magic!"

"Magic? D-don't tell me, it's nuclear magic?!"

"It is still unidentified, but from the scale, I am sure it is. However, err..."

"What is it?! Just say it!"

"Yes sir! About the enemy's offensive magic, it appears to have easily broken through the legion magic for our army's counter-magic defense."

"Wha---?! Then, what's the status of the damage?!"

"The explosion occurred in the sky. We have lost contact with our allied airships!!"

"T-that's absurd?! Are you saying the airships, the Empire's valuable 'Air Assault Division' has been wiped out...?"

Things began to unravel one after another. This could only lead everyone to understand that the damage was more serious than imagined. It was not only one airship they had lost contact with, but all of them. They could only assume that those had been wiped out by *that* magic.

The airships were equipped with a new weapon that could disrupt magicules called magic canceler, and yet they were defeated by magic. This was hard to believe.

"Let's withdraw. No, this is... Right, we're just going to retreat and readjust our positions."

Gaster commanded, but more so to himself rather than the soldiers. Gaster had finally made the decision to withdraw from this unpalatable situation; however, it was definitely too late.

![soft scene break]

A cool voice echoed through the battlefield.

"Ara? Do not tell me this is the end. I have already told you before, once you invade, we will show no mercy."

Gaster's eyes, hurriedly turning to where the voice was, reflected a pale and beautiful face.

She had a full smile.

It was Testarossa.

"I may not look it, but I am a woman of my word. When I came into this world before, I had properly fulfilled the wishes of those who had summoned me. You may rest assured."

Fear grasped Gaster's heart.

It was not a mere terror wherein he was thinking about his own protection; it was a fear that undermined instincts and threatened the very foundations of life.

"You---witch!"

"Ara? I wonder if you forgot. What a rude gentleman you are."

Testarossa responded with an expression of motherly affection, as if she was looking at a troubled child.

Gaster could never forget.

Although it hadn't been long since they'd parted, even if many years came to pass, her pure white hair and scarlet eyes were a charming sight one could never forget.

Beyond that, it was terrifying.

Testarossa's beautiful face was a source of unfathomable aversion for Gaster.

Repressing his fear, Gaster tried to order his men to attack.

Yet no one was to react.

"I do not know what you wanted to do, but your subordinates are sleeping. I guess they must have been very tired. After all, they cannot seem to get up anymore."

Testarossa softly whispered in Gaster's ear. They'd been talking face to face, but before he knew it, she was already standing behind him.

Gaster had never let his guard down and taken his eyes off her. And yet, Testarossa moved unnoticed. She moved at a crazy speed. What was scarier was that she did it with no sound at all.

Gaster's Unique Skill 'Musician' could sense an opponent's movement by sound. It could pick up the faintest of sounds that no expert could control---not just the heartbeat, but also blood as it flowed through the body.

Despite that, Testarossa completely produced no sound.

It was then that Gaster realized another terrible fact: he was also unable to hear any sound from his fallen men.

They were all dead.

"Y-you... Did you kill my subordinates?!" Gaster inquired, as he staggered away from Testarossa.

Testarossa answered him unapologetically.

"Ara? I was a bit hungry, so I ate a little."

"Ate a little? What did you eat?"

"Well, a little bit of the soul."

She said it as it was nothing, and this enraged Gaster. His anger overwhelmed his fear, and so his body regained its strength.

"Die, evil demon! Mind Requiem!"

Taking advantage of that momentum, Gaster brought forth his greatest secret technique. He spread an inescapable, lethal sound wave into the surrounding space. This sound wave had a special effect wherein it affected the mind of intelligent life and caused death. It was Gaster's trump card, also effective against spiritual lifeforms such as spirits and demons.

Even then, Testarossa smiled sweetly.

"Aah, what a pleasant sound. It is such a waste that it was from a human. It is unfortunate. Because I have to kill such a wonderful musician."

Testarossa murmured, her dreamy look clouded over by sadness.

Seeing her like that, Gaster understood that his attack didn't work. Then he was overcome with despair. He was deluded by her beautiful appearance, but Testarossa was undoubtedly not from this world. And worst of all, she was in an incredibly higher plane of existence. Gaster had finally realized that.

*Perhaps, she is much stronger than that rampaging humanoid monster wolf...*

That's right, she was definitely dangerous.

*Are you saying there are numerous creatures such as this monstrosity scattered about in this country?! If that's the case, we might have mis-planned our strategy from the very beginning...*

Gaster regretted it all too late. At the same time, he foresaw the failure of the Empire's military operation. On top of this, Tempest had a close relationship with the Catastrophe-class threat that was Veldora. While they already had a certain chance of defeat in this battle, the possibility of victory was practically nil. Because of that, Gaster screamed desperately.

"Wait, I want to negotiate!"

"Ara, let me hear about it."

"I-I'm a high-ranking individual in the Empire. I'm well-versed in military operations and hold confidential information."

Gaster begged for his life, casting aside his shame and his reputation. But there was still light in his eyes as he watched Testarossa very carefully.

Gaster seemed to be at the end of his rope, but his vaunted ears picked up the sound of several people approaching. He recognized the identity of those approaching. They ran so noiselessly that only Gaster could notice it. Just by hearing their footsteps, he intuitively felt that they were the men of the Imperial Intelligence Agency.

If it was the Imperial Intelligence Agency, then it wouldn't be surprising if they sent out agents to monitor the battlefield.

As the head of the Imperial Intelligence Agency and rumored to be the "specter that fed on information," Tatsuya Kondou was probably taking every measure he could take.

*I will be saved*---Gaster decided to believe.

He thought that he would have his life saved if he bought some time no matter how shameful he may appear.

The reason why Gaster was able to believe so was because he knew a rumor about the Intelligence Agency.

Among the Intelligence Agency members were those called agents, who possessed first-class combat skills and trained to perform in all environments. The names of such strong individuals were unknown because they didn't participate in the Rank Battles. They belonged to the Imperial Intelligence Bureau and were not reassigned from there. Intelligence agents were those who were detached from the mundane world and worked under the mysterious otherworlder named Tatsuya Kondou.

It was nothing more than a rumor. But while there was no credibility, Gaster had to believe in the rumor. If those who would come were mere soldiers, then it was over. But if they were agents, then...

With Gaster's cooperation, they could beat Testarossa. For this reason, he was doing everything he could, even begging for his life, to buy time.

And Gaster won the bet.

"This presence... You're a demon---no, an archdemon!"

Someone shouted and several soldiers rushed out in front of Gaster.

Gaster was thankful for his good fortune. He finally understood upon hearing she was an archdemon---physical attacks didn't work on her because she was a spiritual life-form. And an archdemon---the highest rank for a demon---at that. It was a dangerous being equivalent to Calamity-class. Only a champion-class could fight against such an individual. Gaster could win against her, but it would be a desperate battle.

"Ooh, who are you?"

Three men had arrived. Gaster recovered his composure upon seeing them and asked in a contrived manner.

"Yessir! I am from the Intelligence Agency---"

As Gaster predicted, they were from the Intelligence Agency. One of them tried to say his name, but a man who looked like their leader in their center stopped him.

"Oi, wait! I don't think it's the time to introduce ourselves."

The man, who pointed that out, looked grim once he saw Testarossa.

"You don't seem like a mere archdemon."

"It looks like this one has been incarnated. Tsk, no wonder she has such a weak presence."

"Gaster-dono, we will introduce ourselves later. First, I ask you to join us and defeat this evil demon!"

"Mhm, that goes without saying."

The leader told Gaster, and he could do nothing but agree. It was exasperating to take the initiative, but the priority here was to survive.

The men of the Intelligence Agency surrounded Testarossa in excellent coordination. And they sealed Testarossa's movement from three sides using chains made of a monster's hair.

This move was unfamiliar to Gaster, but this was what was called Imperial sealing formation. By becoming a trinity, they could seal a powerful monster---yes, even an archdemon. It was the greatest killer formation passed down in the empire.

The secret was in the chain. It was the chains of forged holy silver, woven with the hair of a monster. It was a treasured article equivalent to legendary-grade.

Those who were able to manipulate them were not simple soldiers, but disguised figures of the Imperial Guardians affiliated to the Imperial Knights.

Number 11, Davis.

Number 38, Walt.

Number 64, Gordon.

Imperial Knights essentially acted in groups of three when going undercover. Imperial Guardians also had a ranking, and it was customary for the person with the lowest "number" to become the leader of the group.

It was said that there was a gigantic gap between the strength of the top 20 and those in the 30's and beyond. Those under the number 30 were only individuals who had reached Sage-class---a realm out of reach of humans and of those who possessed strength close to that of "Saint," which reigned over the Sage-class.

There was one such person here.

A lead figure during the Lakeshore Dyed Scarlet---Davis.

Davis's team, which had sealed off the nightmarish white primordial Blanc, had arrived in Gaster's plight.

![break]

Upon seeing how the "knights" sealed Testarossa in a trinity, Gaster became relieved and applauded in his heart.

If he continued to feed her with his Mind Requiem, she would perish even if she was a spiritual lifeform.

A moment ago, living things were included in the target of the Skill, but now he adjusted it so that only the psyche was affected.

That was Gaster thought.

However, he was too naive with his perception.

This strategy was under the premise that the target was not incarnated. And since Testarossa possessed a body, it was meaningless if it only affected the mind. Inevitably, Gaster's hope would be dashed.

But before that...

"Ara, ara ara. This is so nostalgic. You were the ones who had defeated me, no?"

"---What?"

"This makes me glad. I was not able to eat enough because you had interrupted me."

Testarossa's voice reverberated, full of wickedness. Despite being sealed, there was no hint of tremble in her voice.

"No way, this evil presence!"

"That face?! It's... Blanc?"

"You're kidding! Are you saying after all the trouble of sealing it, it came back so quickly?!"

Seeing all three of them so shaken up, Testarossa laughed. The way she did it was very evil, yet still very beautiful.

"Tee-hee-hee. That's a nice expression. Fear and uneasiness. And unfounded confidence. You are all just an incompetent bunch, pretending to be brave, yet you are still not running away from me. Really, you gentlemen truly must like useless effort."

"Shut up, demon!"

"Yes, we didn't expect you to resurrect this soon, but did you forget? We sealed you once before. Wait until you have beaten us before showing off!"

"Exactly as what Davis-san said. We shall destroy your soul this time!"

The proclamation was rather laughable to Testarossa.

"Ara ara, how interesting. You are so full of confidence that I wonder if you are all okay. Do you think that the exact same technique you used at that time would work on me again?"

Testarossa questioned them gracefully even while she was still in the captivity of the Imperial sealing formation.

"You're just unwilling to admit defeat. Only a fool would listen to a demon's drivel."

"Gordon is right. There's no place for ya here. If you didn't understand that the first time, then we will bury you again and again until you get it!"

"Gaster-dono. Leave this to us. Please order everyone to leave immediately!"

Davis was always imperturbable. The appearance of Blanc was unexpected, but he did not forget their original purpose. Davis intended to defeat the monster wolf---Gobta & Ranga. That was why he asked Gaster to withdraw the troops to hide their identity from the public.

Davis, unfortunately, held no power to command a high-rank such as Gaster. In the worst case, they planned to eliminate Gaster, but with Blanc appearing, the situation had changed. They couldn't hope to win against Blanc while hiding their identity. More importantly, he was afraid that the whole army would get caught in their battle if they didn't evacuate immediately.

Without realizing Davis's sentiment, Gaster started moving like a sort of afterthought. Gaster just couldn't keep up with the situation.

*Blanc? What's that about? Don't tell me she's that, that great demon? No, this is not the time for that. Rather than trying to find out who they are, it's better to get out of here alive.*

Gaster worked the gears of his head to find the optimal solution in this situation. Then, hurriedly, he tried to issue an order to withdraw to the entire army using his Unique Skill 'Musician.'

But it was all too late.

The moment he encountered Testarossa, all hope was already dead.

![soft scene break]

Davis, Walt, and Gordon were once unsung champions who overthrew a powerful lord of demons. It was the so-called Lakeshore Dyed Scarlet incident.

The formidable white primordial Blanc that ruled the demons of the East had manifested and was about to be incarnated. From that day, vigilance against demons had changed completely. Demon countermeasure offices had been in every city, and demon summoning was forbidden by law.

In any case, if an archdemon were to be incarnated, it would become a situation that required a whole army to deal with. If unlucky, it would be such a terrible disaster that a whole town would perish. And worst, the demon was a primordial.

They were the fearsome lords of demon kind on a different plane of existence even amongst the archdemons and had the strength that couldn't be measured by mere magicule count. Davis had thought it was sheer luck that brought Blanc down. But at the same time, he was confident that they would never lose no matter how many times they fought.

It was because Davis was Number 11.

Even the strongest and most celebrated champions in the surface could not rival the true mighty individuals who had lived in the shadows for more than a thousand years.

The guardian of the great country of Farmus, the majin Razen.

Champion King Gazel of the Armed Nation of Dwargon.

Even the otherworlders Yuuki Kagurazaka and Hinata Sakaguchi, or the Magus of the Sorcerer's Dynasty of Sarion and the Holy Knight Order of the Holy Empire of Lubelius.

Any force would be obscured in the face of the Imperial Guardians. And among this strongest group, the "Single Digits" held a very special meaning. Davis, who was Number 11, held the position to assist them.

*His Majesty had endowed us the strongest armor. With that combined with my strength, there's no way I can be defeated by any demon.*

Davis believed as such, raising his confidence. After urging Gaster to retreat, Davis shouted at his crew.

"Do the "unsealing." Although it appears that Blanc has gained a body, I'm sure she has not accumulated that much magicules yet. Let's bring her down with all our might!"

"Roger!"

"Yeah!"

Gordon agreed while Walt gave a fearless laugh. At the same time, the pendants which had hung from the trio's necks shined. The light became a torrent and enveloped their bodies. Then they appeared as warriors in a full golden plate mail. It was a legendary-grade gear given to the chosen. While the weapons varied from person to person, their armor was of uniform shape. It was the highest-grade equipment handed down from ancient times, which could not even be seen by any ordinary means. Now that they had put it on, Davis and his crew could fight in full power.

"You're unlucky, Blanc! Although you have finally incarnated, you're naive. Meeting us her will be your ruin!!"

Davis put strength to the hand that was gripping the chains to finish off Testarossa. And then, he noticed that she was not resisting. Testarossa, who was supposed to have been sealed, had slipped out with a nonchalant look on her face.

"Did you think I would let this go?"

Davis turned around to the chilling voice. His eyes were on Testarossa, who had laid her hand on Gaster's neck.

There was a dull thud, and Gaster tumbled down. He was helplessly killed by Testarossa.

"No way..."

Davis unconsciously muttered, disoriented.

While Gaster was a man who was full of himself, he was not weak in the slightest. He was competent enough to hold a high rank of lieutenant general. Enough so that it wouldn't be surprising if he was chosen to be an Imperial Knight. Of course, he would have been a low-ranking number, but still, he was not a man to be killed off so easily.

*And yet*---Davis shuddered upon looking at his hands.

The chains forged of holy silver, interwoven with the hair of a monster, were destroyed as if to show that a rare weapon equivalent to legendary-grade was futile against her.

Agitation and confusion shown not only on Davis's face but also on Walt and Gordon's. It was as if they couldn't see how Testarossa broke the chains when she moved. And yet, only further suffering awaited them.

"Did I make you wait? If so, I apologize. This man was trying to escape so I punished him a little. Because if I didn't, it would go against Rimuru-sama's orders. I had no choice."

Testarossa looked at the three and said as such with an enchanting smile. And then, as if she remembered something, she added: "Oh, by the way, it's been bothering me since a while ago, but would you please stop calling me Blanc?"

"What...?"

"You see, I have a name---Testarossa---so please do not call me that."

This line only brought despair to Davis and the other two.

"Wait... A name... You have a name?"

"Testarossa... Is there really someone foolish enough to "name" a primordial?!"

"Incarnated and even possessing a name..."

This was unheard of. Now they had no choice but to admit that the war situation was against their odds.

"We need to withdraw. We must report this crisis to His Majesty."

"Yes, I agree. I will hold her off."

"Then, I shall cast the elemental magic 'Warp Portal'---"

The trinity formation was meant for such a situation. They quickly decided what their roles were going to be, and Gordon began to chant the transfer magic.

Soon after, Testarossa laughed wickedly. Her face was lovely, beautiful yet very ominous.

"What's so funny?!"

As Walt shouted, he held his spear and charged against Testarossa. However, Testarossa was long gone. Walt couldn't keep up with Testarossa's movements.

"Shit, where did she go?!"

"Here I am."

A breath passed through Walt's ear, and a sweet, aromatic smell filled his nasal cavity. Without even looking back, he could tell it was Testarossa. Walt felt a delicate hand of a woman around his neck. It was so cold that it could freeze even his soul.

*AAAAAAAAAAAAAH---?!*

What appeared in Walt's mind was an image of Gaster, who had just been killed.

![full page image](image5)

"I really hate incompetent people."

Testarossa's words may or may not have reached Walt.

*Snap.*

Walt collapsed with a look of sheer terror on his face. Walt, Number 39, had been killed by Testarossa. Seeing this, Davis felt utter despair for the first time in hundreds of years.

"Hurry up, Gordon! She killed Walt. She's too dangerous!"

Although involuntarily, his shout was tinted with fear.

As if he already knew, Gordon nodded without saying anything. Then, the transportation magic was completed, and a magic circle that floated on the ground shone out.

"All right, let's get out of here!" Davis ordered, entering the circle.

The magic circle didn't activate.

"I-I can't believe this... Why?!"

As if to mock the discomposed Gordon, Testarossa gently explained,

"What can you not believe? I am using the magic canceler right, no?"

However, Davis and Gordon didn't understand what she was talking about.

"What did you say? Magic canceler...?"

"Are you saying you replicated it with magic...?"

Testarossa sighed in disappointment as she looked at the two.

Testarossa had been sharing information with Ultima and Carrera through 'Telepathy Net.' Among the information she obtained was the magic canceler installed in the airships.

For Testarossa, replicating technology from obtained information was child's play to her. However, such a feat was beyond common sense. It was too much for Davis and Gordon to comprehend.

What they could understand was...

"You... What are you?! Even if you were a primordial, there's no way an archdemon could wield such a power!"

David barked, as if to conceal his fear.

"T-that's right. You were not this powerful when I fought you before! What in the damned hell you did to evolve to this point---evolve?"

Davis and Gordon looked at each other. Gordon heard his own shout and was finally able to understand the current state with Testarossa. He understood, much to his dismay.

The same was true for Davis. Incarnated and named---That was the kind of a dangerous being the White Primordial, Testarossa, had become.

Testarossa looked at their faces pleasantly. And then she spoke in a calm manner to answer the question that boggled them.

"Ara, you clever boys. Correct. By obtaining a name, I am now superior to an archdemon. I wonder if you know the word demon peer. Its "class" is completely different from an archdemon. It is quite sad that I had to tell you about this for you to understand."

That was an answer that plunged them to an even deeper despair.

"D-demon peer---"

"A second... Guy Crimson..."

It was only then that Davis and Gordon grasped the gravity of the matter. This primordial did not manifest merely for idle sport, but settled in this world with firm will.

"You...you should have lost interest in this world when you lost the body of the princess..."

"That is incorrect. My contract with that lady had already ended when you all came. I wanted to stay, but I left for that reason."

"I don't believe it..."

"Ara, I am sorry. Did you, perhaps, really think that you could defeat me? Of course, that is impossible, you foolish one."

This didn't make any sense. Davis felt his confidence crumble to pieces.

"At that time, how dare you interrupt my meal."

"..."

"H-hey, Davis..."

Both Davis and Gordon had been unable to move since the moment Testarossa stared at them with her crimson eyes. Like frogs being stared at by a snake.

"...Your meal?"

All Davis could do was buy time through this conversation. With the valuable time saved through this, he was trying to find out, in desperation, what caused their body to act like that.

"You are right. The blood did not fully sate my hunger even if its amount had fully dyed that beautiful lake scarlet."

"Almost ten thousand innocent people had died!"

"That was part of the contract. Besides, you all got in the way before I got to my main dish, the most important one."

"You hell spaaawn!"

It was Testarossa who caused the Lakeshore Dyed Scarlet tragedy. But the demon called such a horrific tragedy a mere meal.

*And yet it was not enough...?!*

Davis's heart burned with furious anger. The flame of justice had burned off the fear poisoning him. Davis injected vitality into himself with a single purpose: never let this evil run amok in this world.

"An evil being like you---"

With a gleaming sword in his hands, Davis braved to escape Testarossa's spell. This was then rewarded with his body regaining strength... Unfortunately, though, his despair had only just begun.

"Testarossa, you still won't kill them? I was trying not to interrupt because you seem to be busy, but you should wrap things up."

A cute voice, which didn't belong on a battlefield, was heard from above. It was from a girl with a long dark purple ponytail.

Davis, being ranked 011, could see that she was quite an oddball.

And the tone of her voice towards Testarossa made it feel like they were close, suggesting that she was equal, or near in class.

"Ara, how lovely to see you, Ultima. Did I make you wait long?"

"Yeah, I mean, I'm not one to talk since I was also just chilling with Gabil-san and the others, but Rimuru-sama did say to go all out, so you should hurry up and finish up, or he will get mad."

"That would indeed become a problem."

"Right?"

"I met some old friends, and so I unintentionally had a long chat. But you are right. I shall finish up before Rimuru-sama gets upset."

Davis wasn't able to comprehend the conversation taking place in front of him---no, it wasn't because he couldn't, but rather because he didn't want to.

*This is crazy, this is crazy, this is crazyyyy!!*

Testarossa and Ultima.

Without a doubt, they were on a different plane of existence.

*Two demon peers*---

Handling a single one was already too much, and this reinforcement meant certain death. Davis's flame of justice were once burning hot, but before he knew it, it had completely been extinguished, like wet coals. It was all out of fear. The glory of being Number 11 meant nothing in the presence of Testarossa and the other girl.

Davis could've single-handedly finished them off if they were merely archdemons. But reality was about to break his spirit, for these two were demon peers.

It was inevitable. In fact, Gordon had already cowered and wept. He had once been a quiet and reliable man, but now he looked like a mere child.

Davis suddenly found himself envious of Walt, who had died before them. He had welcomed death without having to realize the true identity of his opponent. He was very lucky...

"Yeah! That's right!"

"Now then, although it pains me, this is farewell. Oh right, since you are old acquaintances of mine, I will show you a magic that suits your wishes."

Testarossa cheerfully told Davis, who was dumbfounded.

Without even realizing what that meant, Davis understood that his end was near.

![break]

Out of a profound darkness came a black flame. This black flame condensed to the size of a fist and glowed on Testarossa's palm. An Abyss Core---this uncontrollable hell flame was easily crushed by Testarossa with her hand. She smiled and murmured as if singing: *"Death Streak."*

Davis opened his eyes wide. He had no idea what that magic was. He failed to comprehend it. He did not understand it. Still, he was certain of one thing---it was an extremely evil magic.

"That boy over there also knows Guy Crimson, right? Then I suppose he also knows this magic. This is what Guy used to become a demon lord---"

This was where Davis had unfortunately lost his consciousness. He wished he had lost his consciousness before hearing that. And then, he was consumed by an even deeper despair.

.........

......

...

The Abyss Core that Testarossa crushed illuminated the surroundings in a black light. The light had the property of penetrating almost all matter. It was dark light, which did not arise spontaneously. It had no physical destructive power, but it had a certain characteristic. When it penetrated an organism, it would affect its genetic structure. With a forceful rewriting of genes, almost all living things would be forcefully killed. A pure evil magic of death.

However, legend had it that its purpose was different. Only a spiritual lifeform or one whose soul had the capacity to remember could endure this magic. Only those who could resurrect even after their physical bodies were completely destroyed could escape from it. The special particles that made up magicules---spiritrons---emitted a special wave. That was the dark light. It was difficult to fend against using magic and impossible to ward off physically. You could only counter the spiritrons by striking them with other spiritrons. Similarly, dark light could only be countered by dark light.

Once you were exposed to this light, your probability of dying was 99.999 percent. In rare cases, however, some people survived. One in a million would gain a new life by becoming a monster. In other words, this magic was also a magic of blessing, bearing the role of selecting people who had the superior aptitude.

This kind of magic was the most evil of forbidden spells.

It wasn't like Disintegration, which was more of a physically-destructive force. This magic only penetrated the Information Particles, with perfect precision. It was the nuclear magic: Death Streak, the ultimate forbidden magic that could even destroy the "soul".

.........

......

...

In this way, Number 11 Davis and Number 64 became the first preys of the 'Death Streak' activated by Testarossa. Following this, a violent gust of death within a limited radius of 500 meters raged on.

This magic could not distinguish friend from foe and would kill all the creatures in its range. That was why Testarossa made sure to check whether allies were present within its range with 'Magic Perception' before using it.

If she did not put a limitation on the magic, organisms within a radius of several kilometers would have been dead.

'Death Streak' could also affect spiritual lifeforms. But it was carefully cast so as not to damage the "soul", so it was harmless to Testarossa and Ultima.

At a casual pace, Testarossa and Ultima checked the aftermath.

"Seems like there's no one alive here. All things considered, you did a good job Testarossa!"

"Ara, about what exactly?"

"These playthings called tanks. You were able to keep them in great condition, so we can examine them once we bring them home."

"Naturally. I deliberately eliminated only the humans for that exact reason."

"I shouldn't have cut corners and just used 'Death Streak' instead. I wouldn't have destroyed those floating playthings if I did so."

"I agree, Ult's magic was very flamboyant. Anyway, we can still retrieve the first samples that fell. They are sufficient data."

"...Right. Frankly, those toys were so brittle that I did more damage than intended. I planned on destroying only one but ended up breaking a lot of 'em."

"That cannot be helped. We became stronger after Rimuru-sama named us. You just need to be more careful, Ultima."

"Yeah! I learned from this incident. Speaking of which, I'm more concerned about Carrera. I doubt she even knows the word restraint, because we both know how she loves really flashy magic."

"That is why she is on standby at the headquarters. I am very much impressed with Rimuru-sama for anticipating even that."

"Aah, I see! That's a relief then!"

That was how the conversation between the two went. They had a mistaken idea about Rimuru, but there was no one there to correct them.

"Benimaru-san was also too worried because there's apparently someone in the Empire that can harm Rimuru-sama. He wanted us to be discreet to lure out that being."

"Yes, that is a bit of a problem. If it's simply a matter of gaining victory, just sending us over from the beginning would be enough. That way, the things that could bother Rimuru-sama will be gone."

"As for that, this was Rimuru-sama's policy, correct? He told us not to fight. Perhaps Rimuru-sama wanted Gobta-kun and Gabil-san to grow up. Rimuru-sama could easily evolve them, but they would have to improve their fighting experience by themselves. A misguided man who is only powerful is just a small fry in our eyes."

"I think that's a great idea, and I understand, but still...it's a shame, right?"

"At least there was still a chance to take a turn."

Testarossa and Ultima, who were in high spirits, were carefully collecting the souls of the dead during the conversation.

In fact, there was a secret behind the Death Streak spell. There was no successful case of turning a person into a monster with this spell. The possibility of turning into a monster by this spell was "only if the soul was left". If the souls were reaped as in this case, the chance of survival was completely zero.

The truth was hidden, perhaps as a kind of story of the devil's deception of hope. Naturally, Testarossa and Ultima knew this very well. That is why they judged that the battle was over when there were no survivors on the battlefield.

Testarossa's heart was not moved by seeing the end of those who stood in her way. She was not moved by it and treated them just like anyone else. It was a natural result, since Testarossa had never had any interest in them in the first place.

Thus, Testarossa's battle was over.

![break]

Two of the Imperial 'Armored Corps' had engaged in this operation, the 'Magic Tank Division' and the 'Air Assault Division', and both suffered a complete defeat.

With the death of Lt. General Gaster, the Operations Center was silenced, and the end-generals, unable to grasp the situation, began to lose ground, and the battlefield turned into a war of annihilation.

The 'Magic Tank Division' led by Lt. General Gaster had 200,000 men.

The 'Air Assault Division' led by Major General Farage had 400,000 men.

Without a commander, the Imperial Army had no way to request a ceasefire. Thus, every single Imperial general lost their life on the battlefield.

This was the moment when the victory of Tempest was decided.

However, this did not mean that the war was over.

This was because General Calgurio, the commander of the Imperial 'Armored Corps', still did not know about the defeat of the Imperial forces.

And currently, the main force of the Imperial 'Armored Corps', the 'Augmented Legion', was advancing towards Rimuru, the capital of Tempest.
