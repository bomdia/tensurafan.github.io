# Afterword

Long time no see, everyone. Fuse here.

I didn't write an afterword for volume 12 nor do I have Twitter, so it really feels like it's been forever. I've been doing some advertising on my author page on Shōsetsuka ni Narō^[For those who are interested, here is his syosetu page: https://mypage.syosetu.com/311735/] specifically in the katsudō hōkoku (activity report) section. If you're interested, please go check it out! I'm sure I'll be sending out some information around the release dates! Now, let's talk about the main story for a bit.

As I'm writing this afterword, I believe the synopsis of volume 13 has already been released. It says, "The horrific massacre by Tempest's overwhelming military might," but what does that exactly mean? Shouldn't the synopsis be more about the protagonist's crisis? That's when I subvert expectations, so it'll give more of an "MC is so cool!" vibe, right?

But still, it's a "massacre." With this, it's no longer about being in a tough situation or anything like that, but more mowing down the enem---uh, please wait a moment. By some chance, will the MC only face crises from now on with this kind of reverse thinking?! As the creator, I don't think that's the case, but please see for yourself what the truth really is!

I'd like to take this opportunity to announce something! You may already know this because it was announced in volume 12's obi^[In Japan, an obi (帯) is a strip of paper that is usually wrapped around a book's dust jacket and provides information/advertisements], but I wanted to inform you that this work, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, is going to be broadcasted as a TV anime! What I wrote originally as a hobby became a novel, then a manga, and is now an anime.

As the original author, I am deeply moved. I wouldn't have been able to come this far without your help. This work is made possible by the strong support of many people! There is no greater joy for me than if you found this work interesting.

Please continue to enjoy That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime!
