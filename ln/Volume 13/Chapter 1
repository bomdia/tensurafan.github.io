# Chapter 1: Unrest and|Resolve

A month had passed since the meeting with the executives.

I had been meticulously observing the Empire's movements in the Control Room, day after day. This was where every bit of scoured intel came together, and as a result, Benimaru and I basically lived here. Although, we made sure to go back home at night. If I left my house vacant too long, Veldora and Ramiris would almost certainly turn it into their own personal hideout. Since a lot of effort was put into constructing my hermitage, it was only right that I should make the most of it.

Benimaru always looked well dressed, so I believe he regularly went back to his room. Even though I didn't necessarily have to worry about such things, there would be a serious problem if our supreme commander collapsed from exhaustion before our decisive battle with the Empire could begin.

The Control Room was constantly staffed. With the threat of war looming, people were present 24 hours a day, and they rotated in shifts of three to make sure nobody was overworked. I made sure that everyone took care of their own health, which was the most important thing. Thankfully, I really didn't have to fret over my sworn friends, Veldora-san and Ramiris, about that.

You never had to instruct those two to take it easy. Rather, they just played around as they liked. They were excited at first about the war, but following a month of inactivity, they became utterly bored. Now, they were back in their research lab and told me, quite selfishly might I add, to inform them if there was any movement. Well, they'd be a nuisance if they were here anyway, so I let them do whatever they pleased.

That's why the executives currently present in this room were me, Benimaru, and Souei, as well as my secretaries, Shion and Diablo. And I couldn't forget Geld either, though I felt sorry whenever I interrupted his construction work for too long. Ideally, I'd like to end the war as soon as possible, before Frey-san flew into a rage.

That being said, it ultimately depended on our enemy.

In war, the aggressors held the initiative. If the enemy didn't come at you, then your side wouldn't be able to fight even if you wanted to. We had predicted that the Imperial tank units would arrive in approximately 20 days, yet their movement was slower than expected. To be more precise, they were purposely delaying their advance so they could flaunt their military might.

While we had already grown accustomed to their appearance thanks to our continued surveillance with my 'Argus', those that saw a tank for the first time would definitely associate them with the imposing presence of a vicious monster. Even monsters were afraid of huge and brutish opponents. The magic beasts living in the forest, which were A-ranked or below, were no exceptions; they fled from the advancing path of the Imperial Army.

Speaking of which, the Imperial Army had already crossed our national border. Although unauthorized entry into our country was completely unacceptable under international law ratified by the Western States Council, the enemy was the Empire, which didn't play by the rules. Since things had reached this point, how we strategically exploited this loophole was especially important.

We could actually use their incursion as a reason to launch a surprise attack...but I still felt that we should at least have a talk with them. The Empire had a history of recommending surrender, so I decided to refrain from attacking until that opportunity presented itself.

"I think we're being way too optimistic when preparations aren't even close to being done. No matter what, we will settle it in battle anyway, so we don't have to be underhanded," Benimaru reassured with a rather complacent attitude.

I found his confidence comforting, and so we steadily prepared for our war against the Empire.

![break]

Thus, the days of waiting finally came to an end.

The Empire had stopped moving and started to get in formation. The Imperial Army wasn't stupid. They never had any intention of fighting fair and square and instead sent infantry units---different from the tank units---one after another into the woods. They numbered 700,000 soldiers in total, or 70 percent of the Empire's total forces.

This wasn't anything new, but I would review it anyway once more.

"This is undoubtedly their main force," I pointed out.

"I agree. The purpose of the tank unit is to serve as a decoy and, at the same time, contain the Dwarven Army."

"I see. They're ensuring their rear will be protected while attacking our country. They're being extremely cautious, even with a large army."

The slow pace of the tank group wasn't just for demonstration. Another, more important purpose, was to distract us from the main infantry unit until they finished assembling.

"Well, at least we clearly see their intentions. It's astonishing how much of an advantage we hold over them simply by controlling information," Benimaru commented with a chuckle.

"Kufufufu, as expected of Rimuru-sama. What you must mean is that everything is in the palm of your hand!"

Diablo didn't waste a second butting in with his usual "sasurimu^[さすリム (sasurimu) : *noun*---shorthand for "as expected of Rimuru-sama" (**sasu**ga wa **Rimu**ru-sama)\\And before you ask---yes, Fuse really put this word in here.]" praise. This was a daily routine by now, and with a quick "I guess so," we moved on. Once you got the hang of it, Diablo was very easy to handle.

"Regarding the Empire's infantrymen, it seems we may have taken their threat level a bit too lightly. Each and every single one of them is talented---there are no deserters, either---and have gathered 30 kilometers away from Rimuru, our capital. They've even encamped and set up a command post there," Souei explained, bringing us all up to speed on the situation.

And thanks to the information that we also got from Moss, the accuracy of our intel was unquestionably high. Supplemented by my 'Argus', we had the full picture of the enemy deployment.

"Wouldn't it be suspicious if we didn't react to the fact that they're practically at our doorstep?" I asked.

"No, I don't think that's the case here," Benimaru rebutted. "They genuinely believe in their own superiority and that their covert operation is running smoothly. They're underestimating us and have begun preparations to move in immediately after their offer of surrender."

"Kufufufufu, I agree with what Benimaru-dono said. Furthermore, these 30 kilometers is the perfect distance---not too far and not too close. After all, surveillance through magic loses its precision as distance increases. With magic interference caused by legion magic on top of that, they wholeheartedly trust the area to be completely undetectable, and that they are pulling everything off perfectly. It is laughable, but I think that is the limit of their capabilities."

Apparently, my worries were unfounded.

I figured they would've found our apparent inaction fishy and reasoned that it was all due to some kind of a trap we laid for them. But, as I was just told, the enemy was under the impression that we weren't aware of their movements. On that account, the only cause for concern was how strong their infantry was.

"So, Souei, how strong are the enemy soldiers?"

Souei had pointed out that the threat they posed was high, so they must've been quite strong. Depending on his answer, I thought it might be necessary to rethink our entire strategy.

"They have an average rank of B in terms of the classification that humans refer to. The higher-ranking ones are above rank A, and the lower-ranking ones are at least C-plus-ranked. Compared to the knights of the Western Nations, they are much better."

Well, that was a stronger force than I had anticipated. However, combat in this world was all about quality over quantity. While B-ranked individuals were tough, there were times where a single A rank was way more dangerous. With that said, the power of teamwork couldn't be understated.

"Are you telling me none of them are temporary conscripts, but instead career soldiers?" Benimaru exclaimed.

"Yeah. The level of training, first-rate weapons and armor, tactics---by all accounts, they outperform the knights of the Western Nations in every single category. You may even find your 'Hell Flare' struggling to penetrate their magical defenses."

According to Souei, the enemy's force had legion magic active around the clock. Their proficiency was simply superb, and their overall strength as a platoon-sized^[Approximately 20 to 50 soldiers.] unit would be A-ranked.

Like Gobta and his subordinates, well-coordinated units were vexatious opponents. Their total strength was often many times more than the sum of its parts. If a group of 20 people were equivalent to an A rank, then simple calculation told us that we would somehow be dealing with 35,000 A rankers. In other words, we couldn't let our guard down. They were pretty dangerous opponents.

"Anyway, it won't be a problem. That's why we have the labyrinth."

"Kufufufu. If the enemies are scattered within the labyrinth, then destroying them before they can even use their full strength would be a cinch. This merely means that everything is just as Rimuru-sama predicted."

*Not really though.*

In the end, the plan to intercept them in the labyrinth was the correct course of action, but it also depended on the enemy's strength---*wait a second...*

Now that I thought about it, I realized something. No matter how large of a force they came with, this interception strategy would be effective. In the labyrinth, it was possible to disperse the opponent's strength while concentrating our own. Hence, the reality was that they could only send an elite few if they seriously wanted to conquer the labyrinth.

*That's Raphael-sensei for you*.

"It's great that Ramiris is here, all things considered," I unintentionally mumbled out loud, and Benimaru voiced his agreement with me.

"It'll prevent damage to the town and also make it easier to turn the war around in our favor. From the perspective of a commander, she is the worst person to make an enemy of."

We could sincerely praise Ramiris because she was currently absent. If we praised her while she was in the same room, she would undoubtedly become smug and be annoyingly boastful afterwards.

Let's leave it at that.

"We don't seem to have any issues on our side, but what about Gobta's?"

On the massive screens in the Control Room, images of various locations were projected using my magic and on display. Naturally, there was footage of our neighbor, the Dwarven Kingdom.

There were 2,000 tanks neatly lined up.

The assembly area was also 30 kilometers away from Dwargon's central city, also known as Central. Impressively enough, we had already expected this to be a location where they'd gather. What I was concerned about was the performance of their tanks. Their muzzles were pointed at the imposing front gate, which I had visited many times.

It appeared that the magic tanks developed by the Empire had better performance than the tanks I was familiar with. There was even the possibility that the range of their guns was better than the ones of my old world's. *Although, I don't think it's possible for the shells to reach the gate from that distance...*

Gobta and Gabil were on standby in the inner square of the gate. The two of them had led their corps and undertaken their respective duties. They were able to evacuate the remaining residents of the inn town without experiencing any unexpected encounters. And, as we'd originally planned, they joined up with the Dwarven Kingdom's forces as additional reinforcements.

"The Dwarven Kingdom received both the corps commanders, Gobta and Gabil," reported Benimaru. "Due to the defensive pact with Dwarven, they haven't lost their right to command."

We didn't have to worry about that since Gazel himself acknowledged it, and even the Dwarven Kingdom's army themselves seemed to be upholding the arrangement.

"So, we are in the clear with that."

"However, I'm worried about their coordination with the Dwarven Army... But I think it'll be fine if Tempest's Army focuses on attacking whereas the Dwarven Army focuses on defending."

The crux of military operation issues was confusion in the chain of command. In a joint battle consisting of armies from different countries like this one, it was necessary to decide which orders should be prioritized. Although with Benimaru, he could forcefully intervene using his Unique Skill 'Generalissimo'. Thanks to that, even if enemies and allies were mixed up on the battlefield, friendly fire wasn't a concern. The inclusion of Dwarven troops was a potential source of confusion; thus, we came to the conclusion that it'd be far more efficient to divide the roles between offense and defense.

"Just to be safe, I think talking to Gazel again would be a good idea."

"I concur. Now that the Empire has already set up camps, there isn't much time before the war begins. It'd be an appropriate time for us to take to the field as well, so should we contact King Gazel for a final confirmation?"

Benimaru and I were on the same wavelength.

Therefore, I immediately reached for our newly installed "Communicator". The Communicator was a magical telepathic communication machine that Vesta successfully developed. The crazy part about this device was its ability to send both audio *and* visual information.

The Communicator looked exactly like a computer. It had a monitor, a mouse, and a keyboard---the mouse was more of a palm-sized crystal ball---and could be activated by simply touching it. After that, if you pressed the other party engraved on the keyboard, you could connect with them. It had a simple design that focused on being user-friendly. That said, there was a drawback.

The visual information were actually "thoughts" being regenerated in the brain. Consequently, whatever you were thinking---as long as you held and activated the Communicator---would be leaked directly to the other party. It worked on the same principle as 'Telepathy Net'. Since I was accustomed to this form of communication, I could just shut down any idle thoughts I had, but if someone unfamiliar tried to use it, they might give out unnecessary information.

There was also the potential danger of leaking any malicious thoughts you had to the other party. You shouldn't think of any ulterior motives. In my opinion, I wouldn't recommend using this device to make advances on women. It would be safer for normal people who hadn't undergone mental training to only use the call function. Anyway, let's just eagerly wait for this machine's improvement in the future.

<Hello, this is Rimuru speaking. Is His Majesty Gazel there?>

I casually greeted with a "hello" as if it was the norm even in this world. It was a habit so deeply ingrained in my body that I had said it without hesitation. And so, that became a rule of using the Communicator, which was quite charming.

<Hello, we are now calling for His Majesty Gazel. Could you please wait for a moment?>

<Understood.>

I could sense anxiety coming across the Communicator. He had the demeanor of a trained individual, but hearing my name apparently sent him into a panic. I mean, I would've been nervous too if a business client's chairman suddenly called me. I should've been more considerate.

"It is extremely rude to keep Rimuru-sama waiting!" Shion shouted, enraged.

*If you really feel that way, then you should've made the call yourself, right?* I was pretty sure answering calls was part of the job description as a real secretary. Despite that, Shion refused to touch the Communicator.

The reason was plain and simple---she didn't know how to use it.

Perhaps saying she didn't know wasn't exactly accurate. I tried to teach her on numerous occasions, but her "thoughts" were so strong that breaking the apparatus was a real possibility. As a result, Shion developed a distaste for the Communicator. She had no right to complain.

"As for me, I think meeting the other party face to face by invoking 'Spatial Transportation' instead of using this thing is better. If you'd like, I could bring King Gazel directly here."

Diablo, being Diablo, remarked that rather proudly. He wasn't any better. It was only polite to arrange an appointment first because the other party still had their own obligations to attend to. This time, however, we were the ones being impolite for calling Gazel without prior notice. Having to wait for a while was normal and getting angry here was plainly absurd.

I heard Geld comment, "It's difficult for the other party to remain calm if Rimuru-sama suddenly reached out. I sympathize with their staff."

I wish Shion and Diablo would follow his example.

![break]

Gazel responded in less than three minutes.

<Sorry for the wait. I've been meaning to contact you.>

Gazel's voice came from a speaker attached to the monitor. No images were shown. Since Raphael-san was the one controlling everything for me, I could choose what footage I wanted to share. Nevertheless, Gazel was still new to this, so he was only utilizing the call feature. It was a wise decision.

<That's good. I'm hoping to get final confirmation of the division of roles in the joint battle.>

<Hmm. While that *is* important, I have to inform you about something beforehand. The gate that links to Dwargon's east city---Eastern---has been blocked by the Imperial Army.>

Gadra's information was correct. Maybe they were the troops being led by Yuuki.

<I found the feed. I'll pass it on to you.>

I pointed 'Argus' towards the direction of the Empire. The feed wasn't very clear due to the lengthy distance and magic interference by a 'Barrier'. Still, you could see a mass of people blocking the road that extended from Eastern.

<It's exactly as you said. Initially, I suspected it was a trap when you said that the *enemy* was betraying the Empire, but now I can see some truth in it.>

<No, I'm not too sure about that. There's no doubt that Gadra has given up on the Empire, but I wonder if we should trust *him*. He has the tendency to take advantage of people without them realizing it, so we should remain cautious.>

<Hah, you could say that again! If you already know this much, well done!> Gazel praised with a hearty laugh.

It looked like he was testing me to see if I had let my guard down, but I was pretty sure he just wanted to act like my senior.

Gazel reined in his laughter and continued awkwardly, <So, Rimuru. It appears that the Empire was being evasive and have been purposely deceiving the envoy that we sent. For us here in Dwargon, a preemptive strike is a last resort by law. Despite the fact that it puts us at a disadvantage, the pride of the dwarves is on the line, so we will wait for the Empire to make the first move. You don't have to follow suit, but what are you planning to do?>

Having deduced his intention, it made me wonder what my next course of action was. I glanced over at Benimaru. He grinned and then shot me a signal with his eyes. We understood each other perfectly without needing to have a conversation.

*Got it.* After taking a deep breath, I straightened myself and turned to the monitor. As I stared at the blank screen, I told him stiffly, <The Imperial Army entered our territory without our consent. This transgression cannot be overlooked, and our country is considering a hardline approach, with even military options being examined. Therefore, I would like to confirm the willingness of your country, our ally, to follow us.>

*Or something like that.*

Benimaru seemed satisfied and Shion nodded eagerly. Geld was trembling with excitement, and Diablo, for some reason, was happily jotting down notes. I had no idea what those notes were or what he planned on doing with them, but certainly nothing good would come from it. I decided to dispose of them later and waited for Gazel's reply.

<Mhmm, now you're acting like a true king. That's fine by me. Wasn't it your intention from the beginning to intercept them here, after having lured them deep into your domain?>

<Of course. Taking the potential damage to the town into consideration, we had the option of fighting along the border. But if we did that, they could argue later on that it was legitimate self-defense against a monster raid. If it's within our territory, however, such a claim would be declared baseless, and the Western Nations would no doubt be instilled with a sense of crisis. The evacuation of the inn town inhabitants was completed successfully and now that they've crossed our border, we have a casus belli for fighting them.>

Gazel roared with laughter. <Fuhahaha! It's great that you've finally learned the art of reading between the lines, but you lost points for saying it aloud, you know?>

Even though I took a stab at arousing his interest, all I received in return was that terrible reply. That was my initial impression, but then he continued to speak.

<Be that as it may, I don't like sitting on my hands, especially when military affairs are involved---issues are bound to occur when misunderstandings happen. Therefore, I will make this as clear as possible: the Jura-Tempest Federation will be in charge of negotiations with the Empire. After that, if it's decided that war is inevitable, I shall declare that the Armed Nation of Dwargon will participate as an ally of Tempest. In order to avoid any confusion with the chain of command during the war, Dwargon will remain more on the defensive side---is that okay?>

Ooh, that answer was clearer than I'd expected.

Since the Dwarven Kingdom held the position of absolute neutrality, I thought that they wouldn't be able to intrude unless it was *their* territory being invaded. This was what Benimaru and others had already anticipated, so I obviously accepted his offer.

<Thank you. It's reassuring to hear that.>

<Cut it out. I know you've expected this outcome from the start. Well, this tactic is the safest approach for Dwargon, but since it is a crisis for our ally, this does make sense. In times of emergency, you can always count on me.>

*Man, he really is reliable.*

We had the backing of Dwargon, which had never been defeated in over a thousand years. Having a place we could escape to as a last resort enabled us to fight with peace of mind.

<Then, we will send a messenger as planned.>

<Our country needs to divide our army into two in order to protect the center and the east. It is also convenient for us to lean more towards defense. Also, be careful. The war potential of the new type of weapon you call a "tank" has yet to be discovered. Judging by the equipment of the Imperial soldiers, the era of the sword might be coming to a close. Forgive me for imposing such a dangerous role on you.> Gazel cautioned as if he were worried about us.

Certainly, I couldn't tell him to ease up because, as Gazel just noted, the performance of the magic tanks was an unknown factor. Hence, despite thinking it was unnecessary, I decided to warn Gazel.

<There were weapons called "tanks" in my previous world too. They used the energy of exploding gunpowder to propel the shell forward. While the principle itself is simple, the actual mechanism is complicated. The shells' power, range, and accuracy were unfathomable. If the magic tanks developed by the Empire incorporated a similar mechanism, then we might not be able to deal with them using existing tactics.>

Like Gazel alluded to before, the age of the sword was probably over. And that would potentially bring forth a bloodier battlefield. Furthermore, what if magic was used instead of gunpowder to fire the shells?

I let Raphael-san run some simulations, and the results that it calculated terrified me. Based on the magic formula you inputted, it was apparently feasible to produce magical shells that were overwhelmingly more powerful than tanks that were the culmination of modern-day science.

And worse, it was a kinetic projectile weapon...

<Wouldn't that render the anti-magic 'Defense Barrier' meaningless?>

<That's right. I believe we require not only 'Magic Barrier', but also 'Magic Wall'. Moreover, since the tanks are expected to have considerable power, I think it's better to implement 'Conjure Earth Wall' and 'Reinforce Structure' together. We can double or triple our defensive strength by using trenches and earth walls.>

<So that's how it is, huh? Everyone was thinking the same thing...We were also working on the development of the 'Magic Armored Soldiers' to cope with the new era. Even though we have obviously been beaten to the draw, it's not my place to complain. In any case, do you think you can win?>

It was a difficult question to answer.

That's why all I could reply with were the words, <It's not about whether we can win or not; "We will win no matter what!" is the only thing I can say.>

Gazel, and even the people around me, seemed very satisfied with my declaration.

<Fuh-fuhahahahaha! What a dependable guy! May the fortunes of war be in your favor!>

<Yes, leave it to me!>

After our exchange, I ended the call with Gazel. This final check had been perfect.

"That's all the confirmation we needed, right?"

"It should suffice. He has ultimately assured us that we are free to do whatever we want."

I nodded, relieved at Benimaru's reply.

The time had come.

At this point, we didn't need to wait for the Empire to move anymore. *Now that we're ready, let's formally start the war.*

Justice was on our side.

The Imperial Army had invaded deep into territory afforded to me as a demon lord---the Great Jura Forest. This was an unacceptable state of affairs. Next, our plan was to negotiate like we were in a state of panic from emergency preparations---this would ensure that the other side remained oblivious to the fact that we were aware of everything. Thus, who should I send?

Gobta and Gabil were boorish and, above all, unfit for negotiations. Especially Gabil... When I recalled my first ever encounter with him, I had believed that he was ill-suited to be sent out as a messenger. If that was the case, there was only one person who fit the bill.

I decided to assign Testarossa.

Well, if it was her, I wouldn't have to worry about her dying, even if the Empire ignored negotiations and proceeded to attack. Even though it was all staged, this meeting was still necessary. In my opinion, it was okay to launch a preemptive attack without any forewarning, but presentation was important for a demon lord.

After being embroiled in my thoughts, I activated 'Telepathy Net' to give the decisive command.

![hard scene break]

Around the time Rimuru and Gazel were conversing on the Communicator---

Inside the large gate of the Dwarven Kingdom, about 15,000 soldiers had gathered---12,000 from Gobta's First Corps and 3,000 from Gabil's Third Corps. They hadn't entered the cave and were instead camped in the plaza's outer edge. The evacuation of the inn town's residents was completed successfully, and now they were waiting for the Empire's next move. No messengers had arrived yet from the Empire, and there was no recommendation to surrender. However, the people gathered here could feel firsthand that war was imminent.

The Dwarven Army was also busy preparing for war.

The Royal Order of the Dwarven Palace had seven units, two of which were the Engineering Unit and Magical Support Unit. Soldiers affiliated with those two were busy reinforcing the gate and constructing a temporary wall. An earthen wall built using earth magic would quickly become harder than a brick paired with fire magic. If it was reinforced further, a barrier as strong as iron would be created.

Work on the third wall outside of the gate went smoothly, and by the time it was finished, the Heavily-Armored Strike Force Unit began to move out. Troops of the Heavily-Armored Strike Force Unit, whose entire bodies were encased in magical armor, lined up with nimble movements that belied their otherwise weighty appearance.

The war situation seemed to have progressed a bit.

Nonetheless, Gobta and others didn't mind the change. Giving only a sidelong glance at the bustling dwarves, the members of the First and Third Corps relaxed without a care in the world. Gobta and Gabil were sitting on the floor, peacefully eating together.

Next to them, for some reason, was a table set up with a luxurious parasol. Near it were Testarossa and Ultima seated in pure white chairs.

They were enjoying teatime.

![full page image](image1)

The person serving them was Veyron, who was dressed like a butler. Although he looked old, his back was ramrod straight. His posture was beautiful and stood perfectly still like a statue.

"This is crazy good! This is one heck of a wild dish! I love it!"

"Mhmm! I am satisfied with it as well. The more you chew, the more the flavor exudes---it has an exquisite texture and marvelous taste!"

The food that Gobta and the others were busy eating had been prepared by Ultima's servant, Zonda. It was broiled bone-in meat seasoned only with salt and herbs. This dish wasn't something that had been officially supplied, but rather made possible with Zonda's catch from his hunting trip.

"I'm truly honored as a chef to hear these praises from you, the corps commanders. I am a royal cook, so camping food like this is still something I need to improve on. Please forgive me if there is anything that dissatisfies you." Zonda added with a graceful bow, then stepped back to Ultima's side.

The double-breasted chef jacket Zonda had on was a splendid piece of clothing, specially made by Shuna. It was made of silk fabric from hell moths and dyed in the same shade of light purple as Zonda's hair. Since everyone was wearing armor and military uniforms, Zonda stood out like a sore thumb.

Even Testarossa and Ultima were dressed in custom-made military uniforms. Testarossa's attire was a trouser type and Ultima's dress was a skirt type, but they had an undoubtedly militaristic appearance; thus, it came as no surprise that Zonda was the odd man out. Zonda's sophisticated mannerisms seemed out of place on the battlefield. You could even feel the elegance radiating from him, yet Zonda had become an indispensable individual. This was mainly due to the fact that he still taught others how to cook on the battlefield, and ultimately won everyone's stomach over.

Also, another reason why Zonda could act freely was because of his position as Ultima's servant. Ultima herself had a freewheeling personality and made extensive use of her authority as an adviser to Commander Gabil. Her stately attitude repelled all complaints from other monsters. Ultima had already turned into a celebrity in the country of monsters. Only a handful of people had the courage to converse with her.

"This does not fit my taste. There are not enough options; I would have liked to see more variety."

"I guess I agree with that too. Don't you think you're cutting corners a bit too much by only grilling or cooking stew? You've finally been acquainted with Shuna-san and Yoshida-shi^[氏 (shi)---It's a more respectful honorific compared to さん (san)], so why don't you sharpen up your skills some more and make yourself useful to me!"

Contrary to Gobta and Gabil's praise, Testarossa and Ultima gave it a thumbs down.

"I am terribly sorry." Zonda apologized with sincerity.

However, Gabil called out to Zonda, "No, no, Zonda-dono. I believe that Ultima-dono recognizes your skills as a cook! The problem might not be the taste."

Gabil's sudden remark drew the eyes of everyone around him.

Testarossa had an expression of interest on her face, whereas Ultima looked displeased because her words were being challenged. Zonda, on the other hand, was shaken as this might incur his mistress's wrath. Veyron was composed and displayed no emotions.

Amidst this unfolding scene, Gobta, who couldn't read the mood, asked, "Whaddya mean?"

"Thank you for asking, Gobta-dono! This is related to something my sister often berates me for. She told me that I should try to see things from a woman's perspective more."

"And what does that mean?" Gobta questioned again, taking an emphatic bite of the meat.

"It means exactly that, Gobta-dono. We can eat our food unabashedly without worrying about what people around us think. Yet, Testarossa-dono and Ultima-dono cannot afford such luxuries."

After hearing that, Zonda finally understood what Gabil was trying to convey and murmured, "I see." He was seemingly convinced. Zonda came to the conclusion that he had neglected a fundamental concept because he never needed to eat prior to his incarnation.

Food was not all always about taste.

"Heh, it's not like you, Gabil-san, to have an amazing perspective like that!" praised Gobta.

"No, no, I am just trying my best," Gabil modestly denied. "With that being said, that was actually Rimuru-sama's words..."

Gabil then revealed a conversation he had with Rimuru a while back when he sought some advice---

![break]

"I want to be popular with girls like you, Rimuru-sama... What should I do?"

"You're asking *me* about that? Personally, it's because I have the appearance of a chil---no, never mind. Gabil-kun, let me share some of my wisdom with you. A certain degree of delicacy is required if you want to be popular with women. If you can do that, then they will naturally like you."

![break]

---Gabil proudly recited the discussion he had with Rimuru.

"And then, I remembered Souka's words. I realized that the lesson Rimuru-sama tried to impart was something crucial: don't do things that will make the other party dislike you!"

Everyone was impressed by Gabil's assertion and thought to themselves, *Rimuru-sama sure is brilliant!* Rimuru definitely would've blushed from embarrassment had he been here in person and overheard this conversation, but fortunately, he wasn't. There was no one who could stop Gabil from monopolizing the story.

Zonda appeared in front of Ultima and Testarossa and gave a beautiful bow. He then knelt down and began to speak. "My apologies, Ultima-sama and Testarossa-sama. I promise that from now on I will do my best to serve dishes that meet your expectations."

"Oh my, you have such an excellent servant. As for my servants..." Testarossa trailed off.

"What are you talking about? Moss appears very useful, you know? Also, seeing how you've entrusted Cien to be your proxy means he's good at paperwork, right? My servants are more into physical-related stuff, so I envy you for having a servant who can handle such miscellaneous tasks."

"I suppose you are right, Ult. We cannot help but ask for something we do not possess."

Testarossa and Ultima continued their conversation, completely ignoring the kneeling Zonda. Their attitude seemed cold to Gobta and those watching, but it was actually the opposite. These ladies, who were the pinnacle of demons, seldom paid attention to others, let alone praised them. Knowing that, Veyron and Zonda, the objects of their discussion, were tremendously nervous. Yet, at the same time, they felt a burning exaltation in their souls with the realization that their lords had recognized them.

However, one person failed to read the mood. It was Gobta.

"Women sure are picky. It's annoying---wishing for food to be cut into bite-sized pieces so they're easier to eat. I get what you're saying, Gabil-san, but really, what a pain!"

"Gobta-dono, even if that is your honest opinion, you shouldn't say something like that out loud," Gabil admonished. "According to what I learned from Rimuru-sama's advice, that's the first step to becoming a gentleman."

"Yeah, I already know that. But this is a battlefield. Eat when you can; don't ask for too much. This is what I think is right in this situation as a commander!"

*Anything is fine as long as you can eat it*---or so Gobta believed. What's more, they were on a battlefield, so when a person said something selfish, he wanted to give his candid opinion on it. Being appointed corps commander imparted Gobta with a sense of responsibility. There was also his desire to act cool in front of his subordinates, hence his outspoken comment.

What Gobta pronounced was right. His reasoning was justified. Be that as it may, there were certain individuals in this world where reasoning simply didn't work. Gobta should've kept that in mind.

"Gobta-kun, you're super funny! I'm getting chills!"

"Yes, truly. It's good that I'm in charge of you."

Ultima and Testarossa both responded with a smile, yet something was amiss---the smile was nowhere to be seen in their eyes. *Ah, this is the end for him*---everyone besides Gobta had the same notion.

"W-wait, Gobta-san. Corps Commander Gobta? I believe that was enough. I'm sure the military intelligence officers have already figured it out..."

The person who hurriedly stopped Gobta was Gobchi, one of his adjutants. Since they'd known each other for a long time, Gobchi was aware that Gobta had no ill intentions and was merely giving his honest opinion. Gobta's statement wasn't necessarily incorrect, either.

On the other hand, one could not live in this world just by being right. There were people to whom such orthodoxy didn't apply. Gobchi was a man who could read the room, so he knew better than to potentially offend these two dangerous ladies. After all, no sane person would leisurely enjoy teatime out on the battlefield.

*Gobta-san, don't you know it's a bad idea lecturing these individuals?!*---this was what Gobchi was currently thinking.

Just like Gobchi predicted, Gobta found himself in a remarkably dangerous situation. Testarossa and Ultima weren't seriously angry with Gobta. They simply thought of him as an interesting toy. However, becoming a toy for these primordial demons could only mean...

Gobta's fate was hanging on by a thread.

But then, a miracle occurred.

<Ah, Testarossa? Can I talk to you right now?>

Rimuru had contacted Testarossa via 'Telepathy Net' at a perfect time. With this, Gobta was saved from a terrible future.

<That will not be an issue. So, Rimuru-sama, how may I help you?> Testarossa immediately responded as she knelt down.

Those who saw the sudden change in Testarossa's behavior quickly figured out that she had received a 'Telepathy Net' from Rimuru. It didn't take long for them to follow suit. Rimuru was utterly oblivious to what was happening out there.

<Ah, yeah. Wait a sec, okay?>

After saying that in a rather laid-back manner, he connected the 'Telepathy Net' to Gobta and Gabil as well.

<Are we all here?>

<Yep!>

<It's fine on my end!>

Gobta, Gabil, and Testarossa could feel Rimuru nodding to their replies. Then, what Rimuru announced next caught them all by surprise.

<I had a meeting with King Gazel just now. It's been decided that Tempest will be the vanguard against the Empire, but before that, we need to negotiate with them first.>

He mentioned how he really wanted to launch a preemptive attack, but ultimately planned to give them at least one chance to surrender. Next, Rimuru explained his agreement with Gazel. The three listened to the entire report without speaking a single word.

Afterwards---

<So, Rimuru-sama. It would be better if I went to handle the negotiations, right?> the quick-witted Testarossa inquired.

Her question had been a form of confirmation, but to her, it was already a done deal. The problem was how to bring the negotiation to a conclusion.

<Ooh, that's right. You'll still be the diplomatic attaché here, so I'm elevating you to the position of plenipotentiary. I'll allow you to consult with me anytime through 'Telepathy Net', and your position will be equal to that of a corps commander, so I want you to work well with Gobta and Gabil.>

<As you wish.>

Testarossa was dispatched as a supervisor, just like Ultima, but she also held the position of commander of the Western Reserve Force. Even though this corps didn't have a role to play in this battle, their military might was one of the greatest when compared to Tempest's other units. She was on the same level as Gobta and Gabil in terms of authority, and calling her the perfect individual to become Tempest's emissary wouldn't be too far-fetched by any stretch of the imagination.

<Y-yeah. You know, it will be dangerous to enter the Empire's territory even as our messenger. Is that fine with you?>

Rimuru had asked Testarossa quite worriedly, but she happily accepted, nonetheless.

<There will not be any problems. I will show the people of the Empire, who do not know their place, the majesty of Rimuru-sama.>

<R-really? If possible, I'd like to avoid war at all cost, but that might be a fool's errand. If that's the case, then...>

<We shall treat the Empire as our enemy and exterminate them.>

<---Huh?! No, wait---well, I guess so, but...>

<Please leave it to me. Idiots who ignore the ultimatum issued by the merciful Rimuru-sama clearly do not deserve to live in this world. I shall destroy them all.>

Testarossa was raring to kill.

Gabil, sensing her murderous motivation, was taken aback, and thought to himself, *I kind of don't want to get involved with this terrifying woman!* Gobta, on the other hand, was still quite something else.

<Rimuru-sama, don't ya worry. Testarossa-san is clearly saying something brave like this because she's in high spirits from being on her first battlefield. I'll accompany and support her properly, so rest easy!>

He declared to Rimuru, completely failing to read the air.

<Eh, *you*?!>

<Of course. As a corps commander, my position comes with a lot of responsibility. Protecting fragile women is also a part of my duty!> Gobta proudly proclaimed to the dumbfounded Rimuru. Meanwhile, Testarossa gave a bitter smile.

*This kid...is stupid, but I don't dislike him.*

Testarossa was amazed that someone could misunderstand her to this extent. She had never tried to hide her brutality, yet Gobta didn't notice it at all, so she thought it was only fair to recognize his boldness.

<I-I see. Then, I'll send Ranga too, so escort Testarossa with Ranga. It'd be nice if the Empire agreed to our demands. If they don't, the war will commence on the spot---be careful not to die, okay?>

<Leave it to me. I'm great at escaping!>

<Is that right? Then, I'll leave it to you!> Rimuru declared and hung up the 'Telepathy Net'.

![break]

Thus, the sortie of the monster army was decided.

Everyone fell silent and was watching the scene---

"It's finally my time to shine! Let's clean up quickly and go!" Gobta's command roared through the crowd. The monster army started to move at once.

![hard scene break]

*Hmm, I wasn't expecting that*---this ran through my mind after I gave my orders to Testarossa and the others. I couldn't say that I was in a hurry to respond to the situation. No, well, I guess it *would* be normal if you thought about it. Acting flustered was definitely not the way to go if we wanted to demonstrate the authority of a demon lord. I felt that their approach was the correct way of going about it.

Anyways, Testarossa was reliable.

It seemed like she would sonorously show off my dignity to the Empire. She did mention something along the lines of how she'd annihilate the Imperial troops, but she didn't really mean it, right? No, of course not... But then again, Testarossa was cut from the same cloth as Diablo. And that meant she was undoubtedly a problem child, so her being totally serious was pretty likely, huh?

Since primordials were crazy dangerous, we should probably stop her---

*It's too late for that*.

This was war, and pitying your enemies was something you did after you won.

There was also an unexpected windfall, and it was Gobta's growth. Thanks to the fact that I gave him a position of responsibility, he was trying to carry out his duties rather seriously. He had become a fine man. The more Gobta grew, the more I'd be able to slack off. Even though I want him to keep doing his best, I'm afraid that he was close to stepping on a land mine. It'd be amusing to wait and see what would happen, but it'd be for the best to reveal the truth to Gobta before Testarossa truly got angry.

While thinking that, I asked, "Ranga, are you there?"

"I'm here!" he exclaimed and jumped out of my shadow.

His wagging tail was so cute. I was tempted to brush it and take a nap right then and there, but I restrained myself.

"Ranga, accompany Gobta and protect him if anything happens."

Ranga's tail stopped swaying. After a moment of silence, Ranga replied in a disheartened tone. "...Understood, my lord. Then, when do you want me to go?"

His reaction sounded somewhat like a child who didn't want to leave. I could guess what he was currently thinking, but my orders remained unchanged. Given the uncertainty surrounding the Empire's strength, sending Gobta alone worried me.

"Please go now."

"Then, I shall be off..."

Ranga prepared himself to leave, looking dejected. *Does he really hate being away from me that much?*

I felt a little sorry, but I wanted him to hang in there. With that in mind, I told Ranga, "I'm counting on you. Gobta himself is becoming more reliable, but I'll feel better knowing you're with him!"

Then, suddenly---

"Leave it to me, my lord!" Ranga promised, bright and full of motivation.

My mere words had transformed his dull gait into an energetic gallop. Besides, Ranga could use 'Spatial Transportation', so he had plenty of time before Gobta and the others departed.

For the time being, I felt a bit relieved.

"Now, negotiations with the Empire will inevitably break down," I reminded. "We'll declare war on the spot, and the war will start immediately. In that case, how should we line up our forces?"

From Testarossa's words and actions alone, there was no doubt that war would break out. I really wanted to avoid it, but this was wishful thinking. Since they've already gone this far and invaded our country, I didn't expect them to leave without a fight. At the very least, we needed to fight them once to display our strength.

However, the opponent had an unknown force---their tank unit. Making a careless move meant it could backfire greatly on us, so we had to consider our strategy carefully. Of course, it was times like these when Benimaru stepped up and showed his mettle.

"If Testarossa's negotiation reveals that war is imminent," Benimaru added, "then we'll isolate the city inside the labyrinth straight away."

"Then, calling Ramiris will be a good idea."

"Yes. Since we are so close to the start of the war, I don't think she'll be bored."

There was something wrong with you when you thought of war as a form of entertainment. I guess the way monsters perceived things was inherently different from humans when it came to these things.

"And then?"

The city would be protected by our best defense mechanism---the labyrinth---as planned. And since we were on our home turf, we would be able to take the initiative. The problem was Gobta and the others.

"Under normal circumstances, there would be too much of a difference between our forces. However, the enemy is one large mass, and you can think of a tank as a monster. In that case, the advantage is on our side."

Benimaru's confident attitude told us that we didn't have to take into account the accompanying supply unit. Although I had my reservations, his words were rather convincing, so I decided to listen to the rest of what he had to say first.

"On the other hand, if we deploy troops on a large scale, they will become easy prey for the tank's guns. I've calculated their estimated power based on Rimuru-sama's imagery intelligence and deduced that the Green Numbers won't be able to hold out against them. Therefore, the Goblin Riders will be the first to face the Imperial Army."

*Eh? Isn't that a little harsh?*

"We're going to challenge them with only a hundred riders?"

"Yes. That's what we'll do first in order to gauge their strength. If the enemy tanks are as good as I anticipated, we can win if we send in the entire army," Benimaru explained with a cool expression, "but if their strength exceeds my expectations, then we will have to re-examine our strategy at that point. Either way, we have to fight them, and increasing the number of individuals acting as guinea pigs isn't fun."

Basically, this meant using Gobta and others as a benchmark. If anything went wrong, the Goblin Riders under Gobta would turn into sacrificial pawns. Yet, Benimaru was unshaken. He made a cold-hearted calculation that this would be the most efficient way.

"In a worst-case scenario, what will happen to Gobta and the others?"

"They have already been instructed to escape using 'Shadow Step' at their own discretion."

*I see... That's why we couldn't move the Green Numbers.*

Benimaru predicted the tanks' performance based on my memory, or rather, my knowledge. It was pretty vague thanks to the fact that it came primarily from what I saw on TV. However, I had a strong ally---Raphael-sensei---so I believe I was able to determine fairly accurate specs, despite my hazy memory.

In addition to that, we had now seen through the Imperial tanks. We extrapolated important information such as the caliber and diameter of the cannon, and the machine guns that appeared to serve as a secondary weapon. These were likely based on the knowledge of otherworlders, so they should be similar in function. Although their power and performance were unknown, I figured that what we needed to remain wary of was still the same.

Benimaru's conjecture and Raphael-sensei's calculation results were within the margin of error, so there was nothing wrong with Benimaru's approach to the operation. I mean, it was better than what I---an amateur---could ever come up with.

This was Benimaru's plan:

First, as soon as the battle began, 100 riders would charge all at once. Taking advantage of their high-speed maneuverability, they wouldn't give the tank gunners a chance to aim through unpredictable movements. This way, they wouldn't have to endure a direct hit---at least in theory. Since it was a small unit, they could respond to any situation. If they were lucky enough, they could use hit-and-run tactics to lead the enemy around by the nose.

I was convinced after being presented with the explanation.

*If you get scared, you lose*---Benimaru had apparently explained this to Gobta and the others. Of course, you never knew what would happen on the battlefield. The enemy might do something reckless, which could result in a lucky hit against our troops. Although we said that they wouldn't die as long as they avoided a direct hit, we couldn't be sure until the moment of truth arrived. And it was for this reason that everyone was made ready to withdraw immediately if things fell apart.

"However, retreating is a last resort. I will not permit any actions that bring shame on Rimuru-sama's prestige."

Benimaru was scarier than the Empire.

"Don't make them do something reckless, okay?"

"That'd be impossible. It is common courtesy to do everything in order to win," Benimaru replied with a bright smile.

There was no hesitation in his expression; it was quite admirable, but I had mixed feelings. I understood where Benimaru was coming from, yet at the same time, it sounded like our only option was to sacrifice someone. I was indifferent to my prestige; although, having such a thing would indeed preserve our nation's dignity. However, if we had to sacrifice people in order to protect that dignity, then weren't we getting our priorities backwards?

I didn't want any of my friends to get hurt...

Let's assume the worst and ensure that the Third Corps can reinforce them through 'Transfer'. *If I was the one fighting, I wouldn't be this worried---*I couldn't help but feel anxious.

![hard scene break]

Armored Corps Commander Calgurio's confidant, Lieutenant General Gaster, was in his mid-thirties and a muscular brute of a man. For this expedition, he was charged with commanding the 'Magic Tank Division'.

Lying on his back atop a state-of-the-art command post vehicle located in the rear, he was enjoying the air of the battlefield. There was no change in the large forest that surrounded him, and the path ahead was clear. Gaster, who had grown used to this familiar sight, thought of the fame that he would gain from this battle.

*I shall overthrow the thousand-year undefeated Dwarven Kingdom---the Armed Nation of Dwargon ruled by the famed Champion King Gazel. There's nothing more exhilarating than this!*

Gaster imagined a roaring round of applause. His name would go down in history as a newly emerged champion for future generations to read about. Just the sheer thought of it filled Gaster's heart with excitement.

*The man who defeated Champion King Gazel*---the title would be his for the taking. It was a story in the not-too-distant future; a preordained turn of events that was certain to become a reality. After all, Lieutenant General Gaster led the 'Magic Tank Division', and they definitely had the strength to back up his ambition.

The 2,000 magic tanks all lined up with perfect coordination. In the grassy plains at the base of the mountain, Gaster was blessed with a majestic view: a 100 by 20 array of tanks sat waiting at the ready. However, this had already been taken into account by his opponent. Each tank measured about 10 meters long and 35 meters wide, and since there were 2,000 tanks, a sizable space was required to deploy them all. Gaster positioned his division based on reconnaissance that they had conducted beforehand, and it matched perfectly with where Rimuru and the others had expected them to be.

Although Gaster was completely unaware of this, he was still an excellent soldier. His exceptional individual fighting ability reflected his position as a lieutenant general. Gaster himself was confident that he could hold his own against an Imperial Knight.

*The only reason I didn't become an Imperial Knight is because I never have the chance to participate in Rank Battles. As long as I'm in charge of this division, I'm stuck in a constant state of military action---*Gaster thought to himself, annoyed*.*

Needless to say, lieutenant general was still a high-ranking position. It was a status possessed only by a handful of individuals in the Empire, equivalent to an upper-class noble. It wasn't an exaggeration to say that Gaster's existence was beyond the reach of ordinary people, yet he remained unsatisfied. Eventually, he would replace Calgurio and rise to become a corps commander. And then, he would become a champion. Gaster's ambition was insatiable.

Gaster desired not money, but prestige. This was why he volunteered for a decisive battle with Champion King Gazel instead of conquering the labyrinth. More importantly, Gaster was capable enough to entertain such aspirations.

He possessed the ability to control sounds---thanks to his Unique Skill 'Musician'---which allowed him to analyze situations in detail by simply listening to various noises. He could also issue specific instructions using special waves, enabling him to command allies even in the middle of a heated battle. It was perfectly suited for presiding over a corps, but that wasn't the only thing worth mentioning.

Unique Skill 'Musician' also hid a vicious means of attack---manipulating sound waves and irradiating a target with it. In other words, Gaster wielded the power of a sonic cannon and could destroy cells through sheer brute force. Gaster was undoubtedly one of the strongest in the Empire.

*Hmph! I admit that the imperial guards are strong. But that's only because they have the legendary-grade gear given by His Imperial Majesty! I deserve to have such gear...*

Gaster was confident that all he had to do to earn the highest honor of being a "Single Digit" was to wear legendary-grade armor.

![break]

Even though Gaster was immersed in his thoughts, he still kept his guard up during the operation.

*Hmm? The atmosphere of the forest changed...*

The ambient noise that surrounded him suddenly died down. As soon as Gaster noticed it, he began barking orders at the entire army.

"Halt encampment preparations and get ready immediately!"

After Gaster shouted his command, he concentrated his attention on the forest to his left. The gentle clamor of animals and birds had disappeared. Even the insects were silent.

There was a tense feeling in the air.

And then---small footsteps. Furthermore, he could hear the sound of rustling leaves getting closer and closer. The source was far away, yet it was moving quickly.

*Are they aiming for a surprise attack? It's not a bad move, but they're against the worst possible matchup.* Gaster couldn't help but chuckle to himself.

Based on what he could hear, he deduced that around 100 individuals were approaching. There had been information that said the demon lord's army was gathering in the inn town, and it seemed like that was where they had come from. This was proof that Calgurio's plan was proceeding smoothly. The demon lord's army stationed at the inn town had failed to notice the Imperial Army's main force.

*How will the monsters react when a 700,000-strong army appears, poised like a knife held to the demon lord's throat?* Gaster grinned as he imagined the scenario.

The sounds had approached the ten-kilometer mark. They would soon be within the effective range of their magic guns. Although its maximum range was 30 kilometers, accuracy suffered with that distance. The guns could technically reach that far, but the actual effective range was three kilometers. However, if you used a special exploding shell, you wouldn't have to worry about the lack of accuracy. There were only a few enemies, and they were advancing while packed together in a narrow area. They probably thought they could use the trees as shields if they didn't go out in the open...

*How naive. First, let's welcome them with a barrage to liven things up.*

The special shells were still in the prototype stage, and only two shots had been prepared, but the blast area was still several dozen meters. Its explosive power far exceeded conventional explosive magic. The terrain would deform under the blast and heat of tens of thousands of degrees.

Although Gaster's command vehicle was the only one that featured this remarkable item, Gaster had no qualms about putting it into use. He promptly loaded it and pointed the muzzle at the forest. Then, he gave instructions to the entire tank division: prepare to intercept in case the enemy fled.

"Left wing battalion, turn counterclockwise!"

The soldiers were setting up tents for the camp, but they remained alert given how the Dwarven Kingdom was only 30 kilometers away. Upon hearing Gaster's command, they began to calmly clean up and stored their things on carts that were being towed by the tanks. Soon after, everyone was prepared for battle. Therefore, without a moment's delay to Gaster's orders, the left-wing battalion---comprised of 500 tanks---floated in the air and pointed their bodies toward the woods.

And just like that, Gaster and his men were ready.

It was almost like they had been waiting. From the depths of the overgrown forest, a single monster emerged: a wolf-like monster with two horns on its forehead. Its massive figure was imposing. It was about five meters long, and it was comparable to a tank.

*That monster is most definitely "Ranga" as reported by the intelligence department. Apparently, it is the Demon Lord's pet, or whatever the hell they call it, but its ability is equivalent to A-plus rank*...

It was a powerful being.

"Just one? What are they planning... No, I get it now." Gaster thought about the reason behind this visit.

*Coming alone means that it's not here for a fight. Perhaps it came here to warn us. That's right, in order to protect his position as Demon Lord, he can't just abase himself in front of his enemies. Kukuku, how foolish.* Gaster interpreted this as an attempt to intimidate the enemy with the big monster named Ranga and drain their will to fight.

"It seems that Demon Lord Rimuru is quite prideful. Is he giving up the element of surprise just to protect his dignity as a demon lord?" Gaster said with a loud laugh.

The officers chuckled along with that remark, and the nervousness among the soldiers dissolved. The level of tension became just right.

Ranga edged closer.

His footsteps were calm and showed no signs of belligerence. As Gaster had guessed, his goal was to negotiate. Ranga finally stopped once he was about ten meters away---a stone's throw from Gaster and his crew.

A woman, who was perched sideways atop, jumped down gracefully from his back, all without making a single sound. Then, without showing any signs of hesitation, she walked up to Gaster and the others. Gaster felt a chill run down his spine as if he'd been hit by an ice blade the moment he laid eyes on the woman's unearthly beauty.

*What the...? This lady has a strange sound...*

The thudding of a beating heart was there, but it played an eerie melody. He could also hear her bloodstream, yet it was quieter and faster than a human's. No, it was way too fast. The human body wouldn't have been able to withstand such speeds if blood circulated at that rate...

Gaster no longer paid any attention to Ranga. He only stared at the woman. Her long, pure white hair flowed flawlessly, accentuating her beauty. However, she was dressed in an imposing military uniform that contradicted her elegance. Her pants looked like jodhpurs, which were comfortably loose around her thighs.

There was another person on Ranga's back, but Gaster hadn't realized it. This was how much the woman's eerie presence had consumed Gaster's focus.

*Who is she...? There was no mention of her on the intelligence reports. This woman might be more dangerous than Ranga, who is considered to be an executive!*

Gaster wanted to give the information bureau a piece of his mind. Unfortunately, there was no one here to complain to. The fact that the Demon Lord's aides had appeared right now was far more important than his grievances.

Gaster spoke to the woman in a dignified manner as if to hide the fact that he felt pressured. "Are you a messenger of Demon Lord Rimuru? You came quicker than I expected, but I suppose subordinates of demon lords are excellent. So, what can I do for you?"

The woman returned a gracious smile to Gaster's question. "It is my pleasure to meet you all. My *name* is Testarossa. I am the retainer of the great Demon Lord Rimuru-sama, ruler of this land. Now, regarding the reason why I came here---"

The smile on the mouth of the woman---Testarossa---deepened as she introduced herself. It was a very, very wicked smile.

"I wish to convey the words of my lord to you: *If you leave now, I will let you do so. However, if you intrude any further, I will show you no mercy,*" Testarossa declared, her crimson eyes shining brighter than blood.

Gaster swallowed heavily.

He was about to shout, "What the hell are you spouting!" but Testarossa moved before he could do that. She waved her hand lightly and, at that moment, a wall of fire materialized one meter in front of the first row of tanks. The wall of flame quickly vanished, but a glassy scorch mark remained on the ground, drawing a single line.

"You already understand, don't you? If you cross that line, your lives are forfeit. Make sure every man that enters is prepared to die. Well then, good day," Testarossa finished with a graceful bow, heedless of the situation at hand. Then, she abruptly turned on her heels as if she had lost interest and began walking away.

It was the signal that negotiations had ended. Ranga wagged his tail like it was the most natural thing to do. Only the small figure swaying on his back glanced at Gaster and the others, but Gaster paid him no mind.

*H-how dare you make a fool of me! Who do you think I am?! Moreover, you better not get carried away by your bluff in front of such a great force!*

Gaster was enraged. He felt as if everything he had believed in so far had been shattered, and instantly lost his composure. They unilaterally said whatever was on their mind and didn't even listen to what Gaster and the others had to say. The Empire should've been the ones behaving this way when dealing with the enemy, not the other way around. That---

The messenger's attitude ignited Gaster's anger, and the fear he felt until then had disappeared. As a result, Gaster made the wrong decision. Testarossa was five meters away. She was right in between Ranga and Gaster.

*I won't let you walk away this easily.*

Gaster steeled his resolve. Showing courtesy to a messenger wasn't something the Empire concerned itself with. It was okay if they surrendered. Otherwise, we simply had to completely trample them. In that case, Testarossa's behavior was an insult to the Empire, and hence a good reason to start the war.

<Can you hear me?>

<Yes sir! Loud and clear.>

<Shoot that impertinent woman in the head. Then commence firing at once with the 20 tanks that turned around in the frontmost row. Show off the power of the Empire to the monsters lurking in the forest!> Gaster secretly ordered using his 'Musician'.

The first to react was a sniper assigned to the command vehicle. He quickly set up the sniper rifle and immediately aimed at Testarossa. Then, a silent bullet was fired from the long-range "spell gun".

The modified long-range version of the small magic weapon "spell gun" had a range of up to two kilometers. At this distance of less than ten meters, it was a guaranteed kill. The bullet contained the elemental magic 'Fireball', which brought up an interesting question: what would happen if it activated inside a person's body?

Needless to say, the target would be burned from the inside out and explode in flames. Even monsters with high magic resistance were often defenseless inside their bodies. There was no way to escape from bullets that exceeded the speed of sound, and thus Testarossa's death was certain---or so Gaster believed. The moment the bullet was fired and passed over the scorched line---

Testarossa turned around. Her facial expression was beautifully wicked.

Gaster's eyes widened in astonishment.

The assassin's bullet that was supposed to pierce through Testarossa's body had been stopped by her delicate index finger. A bullet imbued with magic that had an initial velocity three times the speed of sound. Its hidden magic was never released; rather, it was lightly plucked out of the air and thrown away like a child handling a boring toy...

"I presume this to be your answer. Very well. It is a very satisfactory reply. Let us fight fair and square." After saying that, Testarossa joined Ranga without turning around again. She left the place like nothing had happened.

![break]

Gaster was in a state of panic but overcame it through sheer willpower. Torn between fear and humiliation, his humiliation eventually won. Normal soldiers didn't understand what had just transpired. Only Gaster and the sniper understood the events that unfolded before them. If that was the case, then he could use the tank guns, their strongest weapon, to mow them down like they had originally planned to do. That way, he could protect his pride as an Imperial soldier.

"Lieutenant General Gaster, w-what should we do?"

"Stay calm! Don't be fooled by their parlor tricks! We are the glorious Imperial Army. We will dedicate our victory to His Imperial Majesty! COMMENCE FIRING AS PLANNED!"

In response to Gaster's booming command, tanks deployed on the left wing moved at once. The ultimatum that Testarossa delivered was simply ignored. The tank unit moved forward to make room between themselves and crossed the boundary line---the death marker.

![hard scene break]

*The war has begun.*

This was easier than I thought. The Imperial Army unhesitatingly crossed the warning line that Testarossa had drawn. And that was the moment we entered a state of war with the Eastern Empire.

"I see that it has started."

"Yeah. Everything has been set in motion."

Looking rather arrogant, Ramiris and Veldora were engaged in conversation, slouched in slightly elevated chairs. I couldn't help but sigh. I had hoped that they were going to take this seriously and be more cautious. This wasn't a game; it's a real war.

"Enough of that, please evacuate the town immediately."

Ramiris cheerfully responded to my request. "Roger that! Just leave it to me---Ramiris-san!"

Following that remark, the capital city Rimuru was teleported into the labyrinth without making a single sound. We had delayed the town's isolation until the very last minute because we had to act clueless in front of the enemy. And now, the charade was over. The minute they ignored Testarossa's warning, the gloves were off.

After quickly finishing up separating the town, Ramiris blurted out like she just remembered, "Oh right, Treyni-chan left a message."

"Hmm?"

"Uh, she said she felt a suspicious presence and decided to meet them in person."

"Huh? What do you mean?"

"Yeah, I'm not sure, either?"

I should've known better. Ramiris was the wrong person to ask for a detailed report.

First of all, she wasn't even my subordinate, so I had no reason to complain. I was already grateful for the fact that she was helping us and getting involved in the war when she had no obligations. Besides, it should be fine since it's Treyni-san---actually, now that I thought about it, she could be irresponsible at times too.

"Souei, what are we doing about these intruders?"

I was a little worried, so I wanted to double check with Souei.

"There is no problem. As previously discussed, we only have to focus on the large gate that appears aboveground."

*Seems like I'm just overthinking things.* A sense of relief washed over me. Some spies had apparently infiltrated us, but they were being handled by Souei and his "Dark Shadow", so I didn't have to stress over it that much.

Speaking of which, let's talk about each floor.

The 91st to 95th floors were exchanged with the 96th to 100th floors. The entire town on the surface had been shoved to the bottom of the labyrinth---a temporary 101st floor. To get this far, you needed to defeat Veldora. And if that ever were to happen, common sense dictated that our defeat would've been inevitable.

The last line of defense was Floor 95. The 91st to 94th floors were the dragon rooms, and if you managed to get past them, you had Veldora waiting patiently for you at the end. Behind that was the Control Room, which we were currently occupying. If Veldora lost, then we were supposed to buy some time there.

Under those circumstances, we would return the town to the surface and have the inhabitants escape while Geld's troops protected them. To be frank, that was quite a reckless thing to pull off. Thus, I hoped that the Floor Guardians did their best here. At the very least, the labyrinth's defensive preparations were perfect.

I mean, normal armies couldn't break through the 95th floor even if they tried to. Naturally, all services in the labyrinth were halted because of the war. Stopping the sale of Resurrection Bracelets was a no-brainer, while inns and restrooms would be closed. In other words, our enemies were forced to prepare food and gather other resources by themselves. We also planned to shut off the water supply that was typically found on every 5th floor in order to increase the difficulty.

If you were serious about attempting to conquer the labyrinth, then you had to set aside days, if not months. Therefore, having a large army wasn't exactly better for them; rather, it was a hindrance. According to the information obtained from Gadra and others, the Empire's soldiers had been augmented. They could allegedly go a week without eating or drinking, but nonetheless, they should have trouble defeating the labyrinth.

I ran simulations with several Western Nation knights, and they had no chance of successfully conquering the labyrinth. Even if the Imperial Army was comparatively better, breaking through the labyrinth wouldn't be so easy. Perhaps I was worrying a bit too much, but well, you could never be too careful. There was also the possibility that they would ignore and bypass the labyrinth, so we had no other choice but to wait and see what moves the enemy took.

And just like that, everything was ready.

The Empire's movements had already been notified to neighboring nations, so they were most likely praying for our victory right now. The Western Reserve Force was on standby to prepare for a worst-case scenario, so I hoped they could handle the rest as the situation demanded.

Thus, I focused again on the battlefield.

![break]

Testarossa rejoined Gobta and left the field riding on Ranga's back. The imperial tank unit was deployed like they were going to chase after them. The tank guns were moving, which gave the impression that they were about to fire at them.

"Is this going to be okay?"

"It'll be dangerous if they land a hit, but there's no need to fret," Benimaru replied fearlessly.

Then, Benimaru gave the First and the Third Corps orders by using his Unique Skill 'Generalissimo'. The Tempest forces acted all at once.

The Green Numbers began their cautious advance toward the enemy's rear. They had entered the forest and utilized the trees as cover, paying close attention in avoiding enemy detection. If they believed they could win, they would attack; if they felt the enemy was dangerous, they would withdraw---I guess they didn't intend to make any rash decisions before finding that out.

Of the aerial cavalry unit that Gabil led, 100 Hiryuu and 300 Wyvern Riders from the Blue Numbers instantly took to the skies. They intended to launch an aerial assault on the slow-moving tanks. While I believed it was a good decision, the enemy also had units with flight capabilities. Once those appeared, then it was going to be a heated battle.

Last but not least was Gobta's crew, the group closest to the enemy forces. Given how the power of the tank gun was unknown, staying within its range would be suicide. There was still a lot of distance between the two armies before they made contact, but since the enemy's effective range was unknown, vigilance was necessary.

Besides, it didn't seem like the Goblin Riders had been spotted yet; I believe they intended on attacking the tank guns. Maybe there were new weapons that even Gadra didn't know about.

![break]

<<Report. Based on calculations from the orientation and angle of the tank guns, their aim is accurate. It appears they know the exact position of the Goblin Riders hiding in the trees.>>

![break]

*EHHH?!*

*That's really bad news.*

"Benimaru, it looks like the enemy is somehow locating Gobta and his group!"

"Understood. I thought that might be a possibility, which is why I told Gobta and the other Goblin Riders to act as the vanguard."

I was the only one panicking, whereas Benimaru's calm attitude stood firm. Apparently, this turn of events was within his expectations. I decided to trust Benimaru and wait to see what happened next.

There were 2,000 tanks in total; 500 of them had rotated around, wary of Gobta and his group. Moreover, the 20 frontmost tanks were about to fire their main gun. There was a striking difference between these tanks and the ones from my original world---didn't these tanks have shorter barrels?

Encountering areas with dense thickets while passing through the foothills of a mountain range was unavoidable. However, that scenario in particular posed no problem for the tanks since their short barrels allowed them a greater range of maneuverability. Either way, it seemed that they were also content with knocking down trees through brute force.

Still, the fact that it was easy to turn made it convenient for them to maintain a tight formation. They could also make brisk turns without being obstructed by each other's barrels. It was unclear whether or not the barrel's length retained accuracy and range, but that was a question for another day. They'd probably solved such an issue given how they were using these tanks in the first place.

Now, as for Gobta and the Goblin Riders.

Gobta had already reunited with his unit. His face was pale, but it wasn't because he was scared of the tanks---perhaps it was the realization about Testarossa's true nature, and the fact that he was in a very dangerous predicament.

Testarossa sat sideways on Ranga's back and gracefully brushed her hair. Now that the negotiations were over, she thought she had done her part. Well, to be honest, her actions were laudable since she returned safely. I didn't mind if she rested for a bit, but now was not the right time.

As I was pondering that, the tanks finally fired, and 21 shells came flying.

It was hard to tell from just observing through Argus, but the one shot that left the command vehicle looked different from the others. *What is that?*

<Gobta, "Shadow Hide"!>

"Everyone, Shadow Hide!"

Benimaru's order was swift, leaving my doubts behind in the dust. Gobta instantly acknowledged it. Without a moment's pause, the Goblin Riders disappeared with 'Shadow Step'. What followed immediately after was a shower of shells.

A rain composed of 21 destructive shots.

It was a hell too horrible to fathom.

![break]

<<Answer. Since the caliber of the tank gun is 120mm, the mass of the shell is estimated to be approximately 21 kilograms. Based on the distance to the point of impact and elapsed travel time, the calculated speed is found to be less than six times the speed of sound. Kinetic energy is proportional to the product of mass of the shell and its velocity squared. From these conditions, the muzzle energy and penetration capability can be determined. The decrease in speed is inversely proportional to the transverse load, and air resistance has also been taken into account by simulating the surrounding environment. These values are then multiplied by the magical power coefficient hidden in the shell. If the computed value was converted in terms of TNT, it would be--->>

![break]

*You know, I'm really sorry to say this when you seem so happy explaining everything, but...uh, I don't know how strong TNT is anyway, so even if you converted it, I still wouldn't know...*

![break]

<<...Understood. Then, in practical terms, if the main gate of the Dwarven Kingdom sustained a direct hit, it would be destroyed. Even an A ranked dragon cannot withstand it. Anyone within five meters of the point of impact will suffer significant injuries, and those under C rank caught in the blast have no chance of surviving.>>

![break]

*Now that's more like it. You should've explained it this way from the start---wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!*

That was pretty disturbing. Furthermore, given how there was apparently a mysterious shell mixed in with the barrage, I began to truly worry for Gobta's safety.

However, my concerns turned out to be unfounded.

The ground exploded as soon as the shells landed. It continued 20 times in a row, completely changing the terrain. When the last shot finally hit, a fire engulfed the location where Gobta and his group had been located. A gust of wind and a small storm shredded the surrounding area. The damage extended to several dozen meters, demonstrating the monstrosity of its power. That was most likely the mysterious shell's effect. *How dare they develop a shell as dangerous as nuclear magic?*

It was knowledge of the fact that Gobta's group was safe that enabled me to make a comment like that. They had responded to Benimaru's order in the blink of an eye and used 'Shadow Step' to retreat.

<I'm glad everyone is all right.>

<No, we aren't! A shock wave has even managed to penetrate the shadow space!>

<Did someone get hurt?>

<No, no one's injured. Thanks to Benimaru-san, we're all safe.> Gobta replied happily. He complained about it being painful, but at least he sounded fine. *By the way, I wonder if Testarossa could do 'Shadow Step'---never mind, she seemed okay, so there's no use worrying about her.* More importantly, the issue at hand right now was debating our next move.

![soft scene break]

I formed a network using 'Telepathy Net' and connected it with Benimaru, Gobta, and Testarossa.

In addition, I activated 'Thought Acceleration' to lengthen the perception of time. This allowed for meaningful conversations even in a short period of time.

<So, what should we do next?>

I wanted to hear Benimaru's opinion.

<As of right now, Gabil's unit is heading to launch an assault on the enemy tank unit. I want Gobta and others to intercept the enemy and perform a pincer attack.>

Hoh.

<Wouldn't that be dangerous?>

<Yes, it'll be dangerous, but Gabil's team will create a diversion, and Gobta and his group will then seize that opportunity to attack. The tanks' destructive power is beyond expectations, but not their mobility. They have a good chance of winning.> Benimaru declared proudly.

After examining the offensive and defensive capabilities from what happened just now, we determined that the flight speed of Gabil's team was faster than the turning speed of the tank guns. This meant that Gabil's unit, which was all about evasion, theoretically shouldn't be hit by the tank's gun.

While Benimaru claimed that getting struck was next to impossible, I'd say charging straight at the enemy was the scariest part. On the other hand, Gabil was brave and looked as though he didn't seem to care about that at all.

I guess as long as you were flying, you wouldn't be hurt because you could avoid the enemy's line of fire. As for Gabil, I'm sure he'll get through it with his enthusiasm.

Next, regarding Gobta and his men.

<A-are we going to charge in as well?>

<You guys are the stars of the show, but don't worry. Once you've slipped into their lines, they'll move slower due to fear of friendly fire. So, once Gabil's team begins their diversion, run through them as fast as you can!> Benimaru mercilessly ordered Gobta like an oni. *Well, he **is** an oni, after all.*

<Um, we'll do so while we're still in 'Shadow Step', right?>

Benimaru shook his head at Gobta's question.

<That's dangerous. I expect the enemies to have a variety of defensive measures prepared, including monster detection and defense barriers. They'll also probably have countermeasures against Skills, so it's better to avoid an obvious tactic like that.>

I agreed on this part as well.

Their treasured tanks definitely had an exhaustive defense system in place because there was no way they would leave them unprotected. There were also barriers against Skills, and it'd be bad news if they had one installed. It might be safer instead to attack them head on.

<There is something called interfacial barriers in legion magic. It is a magic that prevents surprise attacks from a different space, but by that same principle, it can also be used to trap us and restrict our movements. As Benimaru-dono noted, a frontal assault may be the safest option.>

Testarossa did a good job summarizing what I wanted to say.

Even Gobta appeared like he understood everything.

<G-got it. I-if T-Testarossa-sa-n says so, I have no complaints.>

*Gobta seems scared.*

*I mean, he did spew some pretty offensive stuff right to an overwhelmingly higher being's face.*

No wonder he was deathly afraid.

I was anticipating--- No, looking forward to--- No, not that either... Right, I'd been waiting for the right moment to quietly follow up on this particular matter. Therefore, I decided to give Gobta a little piece of advice.

<Gobta-kun. You shouldn't judge people by their appearances. Keep that in mind again and don't make the same mistakes again!>

*Although, this also applied to me as well.*

*After all, I wouldn't have been aware of the truth of the three demon ladies had I not been explicitly informed about it...*

<Yeah. I'll give it some thought...>

*Yep, yep. That's good!*

"May I ask what you are talking about?"

"This isn't a secret by any means; it's about Gobta's misunderstanding."

"Ahh, with Testarossa? That guy has certainly grown, but he lacks the crucial takeaways. It's better if he learns from his mistakes through experience from time to time."

Benimaru seemed to have also noticed and smiled wryly at my explanation.

"Speaking of which, who were those people that Diablo brought here with him? Especially the three ladies, I felt something unusual from them."

I had approved of them, and so Benimaru accepted them without a word. However, as expected, he was apparently concerned about their identities.

But you see... I didn't want to reveal the fact that they were very dangerous demons called primordials---ignorance would indeed be bliss in this case.

That said, I didn't think I could keep it a secret forever.

I felt sorry about being unforthcoming to even my own executives. While Shion neither knew nor cared, it might've been a good idea if I told Benimaru.

"---Regarding that, I'll tell you some other time."

Benimaru shrugged in response to my answer.

"Well, that is fair. This isn't a topic we should be focusing on in the midst of a war."

He looked like he was convinced, and so I also decided to change gears.

<So Gobta, it is wartime right now. Reflection is important, but do that after you come back alive.>

<Of course!>

<Do you have any questions about the plan's outline?>

<Nothin', Benimaru-san. We will move to the edge of the forest and rush in when Gabil-san starts the attack.>

<Good. Get excited!>

<Yeah!>

Gobta was no longer scared.

Now, he could concentrate on the plan.

Thus, I ended the 'Telepathy Net' meeting.

![break]

After a few minutes---

The Third Corps, led by Gabil, assaulted the tank unit.

"Gah-ha-ha-ha! Behold my genius! Clumsy people like you guys are no match against us!"

As usual, Gabil was excessively enthusiastic and struck an overly dramatic pose.

This made me worried, but I suppose he was simply being himself.

In fact, the tanks were unable to respond immediately.

Just like what Benimaru predicted, the movement of the tank guns couldn't keep up with Gabil's team.

Gabil deserved a lot of credit. With his excellent command, everyone's coordination was perfect.

That was likely the result of substantial training. They seemed to have acquired remarkable combat aerial capabilities.

While the 100 Hiryuu was a given, the 300 Wyvern Riders were also performing brilliantly. I heard there were reserve riders trained, so if the number of wyverns increased, they would become a reliable force.

Gabil's primary purpose was to act as a diversion, but it wasn't as though he didn't attack at all. He also let the wyverns spit fireballs as another distraction.

As monsters equivalent to B-plus rank, their fireball was naturally as powerful as the elemental magic 'Fireball' of an average magician.

It wasn't enough to break through the tanks' magical defenses, but it was still effective against foot soldiers. This demonstrated Gabil's true worth: air-to-surface attacks.

It was a minor achievement in terms of military prowess, but they fulfilled their tactical role excellently.

Next, we had Gobta...

He apparently had a complete change of heart.

There was no hesitation in Gobta's command now, and they immediately charged at the tank unit with perfect coordination.

Beyond the 500 tanks currently facing Gobta's team were the 1,500 tanks facing the Dwarven Kingdom. If they managed to infiltrate that far, then the enemy wouldn't be able to act carelessly.

It'd be a major victory if they could get there, but the Imperial Army wasn't incompetent. They would try their best to block Gobta's advance; in other words, it was a battle of proficiency and speed from.

Gobta seemed to understand this and, while following Benimaru's instructions, used their thunderous speed to run through the tank unit.

They didn't even look at the muzzle that was pointed at them and showed no signs of fear.

About a hundred meters remained until they reached the front row of the tanks.

The Goblin Riders could run the distance in less than six seconds.

Several shots rang out, but Gobta and his group weren't frightened. They didn't slow down and kept running.

In truth, the bombardment looked like it was for intimidation purposes given how the shells exploded in the wrong direction.

This was evidence that the Imperial Army was shaken up.

The Goblin Riders moved with elegant efficiency and thoroughly eliminated obstacles that blocked their path.

Even now, the infantry that were guarding the tanks tried to block the way, but instead became prey to the wolves.

The distance was now zero.

Thus, they succeeded in approaching the tank unit, their primary goal.

Ranga was running in the front with Gobta straddling him. They were a magnificent sight to behold.

Gobta signaled Gobchi with his eyes, who was in the second position. Gobchi nodded in response. The next moment, Gobchi was the only one that headed for a tank turret and threw a small "something" inside.

That "something" was a glowing red jewel.

It was a Spirit Core---otherwise known as a Core.

Kurobee had prepared a huge number of empty Cores, and I asked Charys to imbue them with fire mana.

One might think they were being prepared for magic swords, but instead, they saw better usage as a substitute bomb.

I called it the Flare Bomb.

The question now was whether or not it would actually work...

An incendiary explosion would occur inside the tank, which was their one weakness. If this didn't work, then we were going to stop the operation immediately.

"Will it be all right?"

"Rimuru, there's no need to worry. Believe in my friend Charys!" Veldora boomed.

"Rest assured, Rimuru-sama. Given how they are imbued with mana to the point that they are ready to explode, I am confident that they can easily render those lump of irons inoperable."

I also thought it was okay, but this was a preliminary experiment. And as if to tell me not to worry, the tank exploded.

"See? Just like I said, right? My plan is perfect!"

This was entirely my idea, which was why I'd been extra worried... But since it succeeded, I couldn't help but want to brag.

"You sure changed your tune quick..." Veldora observed.

"That's so like him!" Ramiris agreed.

"Speak for yourselves!"

We shouted at each other.

Charys looked proud; Benimaru and Beretta smiled bitterly, whereas Shion and Diablo both grinned.

The success of the second phase of the operation created a slightly brighter atmosphere.

![break]

It had been the prelude up until now.

The next step was to sneak into the inner part of their formation. Gobta's team hit the center while ignoring the foot soldiers poised to stop them.

They ran while hitting the infantry units that'd been placed to protect the turret's blind spots---like a giant monster running about on the battlefield.

The movement was projected on a large screen, showing off its polished beauty.

"Gobta sure did it. They won't be targeted by tank guns at this rate."

"No, we can't let our guard down. Depending on the enemy commander, they might ignore the damage to their own comrades and continue attacking us."

I thought that would be foolish, but this was war.

We had to assume that was a possibility.

"Besides, they also have airpower. It's still too early to relax."

*He's right*---I thought to myself and turned my eyes to another big screen.

Looking at the sight of flying objects projected on there, I could see that their speed had increased. The Empire also seemed to be coordinating by some means.

When the enemy's air force arrived, Gabil would have to deal with them. And when that happened, Gobta's group would end up isolated on the battlefield.

If that was the case, then it was a race against time.

I wanted to achieve a decisive victory while we still could.

Progress on the battlefield continued to advance smoothly and up to my expectations.

Gobta and Gabil.

The two maximized the results of their training and had been successful in their first real battle. However, nothing ever works out perfectly forever.

Like Benimaru said, it was too early to relax---

![hard scene break]

Gaster glared at Gobta and others who were approaching him with annoyance.

*You fuckers are getting carried away!*

Gaster vowed to make his inner vexation clear with the monsters that loomed in front of him.

Just now, Testarossa, with her fluttering pure white hair, had instilled fear into him. Refusing to admit it, Gaster decided to regain his confidence by tearing Gobta and his group to pieces.

Gaster thought that it was impossible for the monsters, who could only disrupt their deployment, to damage the tanks, regardless of how quickly they moved.

However, that preconception was shattered with the roar of an explosion on the battlefield.

*You can't be serious?!*

Gaster wanted to shout, but stopped himself just in time.

A commander could never, ever be visibly upset on the battlefield. Gaster was still a brilliant man, and he hadn't lost his wits yet.

"Lieutenant General, what should we do?"

"Don't panic. Take a closer look at the enemy's movements. They've only destroyed a single tank and show no signs of following up. This is proof that the bomb is one of the few trump cards they possess."

"I see. In my opinion, you're right. Otherwise, the lizards flying in the sky would've scattered them too."

*Exactly,* Gaster nodded in agreement.

He thought he had made a calm and reasonable assumption, but it couldn't have been further from the truth.

In reality, Rimuru had prepared a total of 3,000 flare bombs. Gobta and the rest of the Goblin Riders each had ten, and the flying lizards---Gabil and his Hiryuu---also had ten per person.

Gabil and his unit didn't bother using the flare bombs because they were concentrating on acting as a diversion. They also knew that flare bombs wouldn't reach their full potential unless they were employed in an enclosed area.

Gunpowder was twice as powerful when detonated in a confined space.

The same logic applied to flare bombs.

Benimaru's primary focus was the destruction of the tanks, not the soldiers around them. As a result, he forbade everyone from wasting their flare bombs.

The important thing was the success or failure of the operation, not the immediate achievement.

Gobta, Gabil, and the monsters under their command all understood this very well.

Gaster, who didn't know that, regained his composure by giving himself a little pep talk.

*I commend you for unleashing your new weapon without hesitation. However, we're the ones who will win!*

Gaster misread Gobta and the others' trump card, but he knew precisely what their goal was.

*The reason why you ignored the left-wing battalion is to crush this one, right? If so, then we have more than enough options!*

Gabil and his groups' attacks were flashy, yet they were rendered ineffective by a magical barrier. The only thing to be wary of was the new weapon, so then it boiled down to keeping Gobta's unit away.

"Let's use a concentrated air battle formation to deal with them."

The adjutant was surprised at Gaster's orders.

"Lieutenant General, that's dangerous! Now that some of our men are interspersed with enemy forces, shouldn't we be worried about potential friendly fire?!"

"What does that have to do with anything? If they are in the way, why wouldn't we simply blow them up with our tank guns? Moreover, the glorious Imperial Army has no need for incompetent fools who drag down their allies in the first place!"

"Wha---?"

With such a declaration, the adjutant could no longer stop Gaster.

A few tanks and a large number of infantry would be lost, but they would definitely win the battle---and the adjutant knew this.

To win a battle by sacrificing a few without a second thought---a commander required that type of vision and determination.

"Is there an issue with the legality of my decision?"

"No sir. There is nothing wrong."

The military staff agreed with Gaster's judgment.

Thus, Gaster began his solo recital.

<Left wing battalion, take a concentrated air battle formation!>

By using his Skill, Gaster gave the order directly without going through his subordinates. This allowed the left-wing battalion to form up faster than ever before.

Ignoring those who were already overtaken by Gobta and others, the remaining vehicles blocked the road and rotated their tank guns. Then, other tanks quickly joined the formation.

It was a formation that defied even the common sense of modern warfare.

"What?! What kind of nonsense---!"

It was no surprise that Gobta was stunned and shouted.

The tanks took advantage of their giant stature and squeezed together like they were trying to eliminate any gaps. With that, however, they wouldn't be able to move. Still, it was effective as this made it impossible for Gobta and his men to escape through the cracks.

Nevertheless, it was still too early to be surprised.

The left-wing battalion spread out in a circle and formed a barricade around Gobta and the Goblin Riders. In response to the barricade, half of the center main force also began to move. They floated into the air, turned around, and landed on the backs of the tanks in the frontmost row. They became a wall that blocked Gobta's path.

Nearly a thousand tanks were linked together and turned into one huge fortress. This completely prevented Gobta's team from destroying the central unit.

"I've heard that they were capable of that kind of movement, but I never would've thought they could pull something like that off..." Gobchi muttered, who was Gobta's adjutant, clearly shocked by the scene that unfolded before him.

<Stop the enemy's movement with a barrage from the machine guns!>

What followed was a three-dimensional machine gun sweep. The multifaceted barrage prevented the high-speed maneuvering that Gobta and his friends excelled at.

Gobta and his men were surrounded by tanks and troops that accompanied them, but that didn't matter at all.

"This is bad. At this rate, we won't be able to carry out the operation!"

Gobta became upset when Benimaru's strategy fell apart.

Seeing the Imperial soldiers being shot by their allies, Gobta was understandably growing impatient.

"Grrr... Sorry, Gobta. I want to help you, but our hands are tied..."

Gabil's team was under heavy fire in the air.

Even if the tank's cannon couldn't hit them, they were still equipped with machine guns. That was why Gabil and his men were being kept away.

![break]

Now that commander Gaster regained his composure, the difference in numbers became a decisive advantage. And bad things always came in twos.

<Sorry for the wait, Gaster-dono!>

The Air Assault Division, led by Major General Farage, had appeared with a hundred airships.

Gabil's group would be forced to deal with them, which put Gobta and his men in an increasingly difficult position.

<Ah, Farage, you've finally arrived. So, I guess this means checkmate. This is the perfect stage for a test run of the top-secret weapon 'magic canceler', isn't it?>

<Haha, I can't compete against you, Gaster-dono. Without a moment's delay, we will also now join the battle.>

<I'll share the credit with you. Don't make any mistakes, okay?>

<Understood. Then, best of luck!>

By using a special line of communication, Gaster and Farage agreed to work together.

For Gaster, this was to make the strategy rock solid.

For Farage, the purpose was to warm up before the main show, and to demonstrate that they could be useful in actual battles.

The Air Assault Division had a precious weapon called an airship, but their position was the lowest among the three divisions. Thus, it was necessary to prove their worth.

With the participation of Farage and his airships, the situation became even more disadvantageous for Tempest's forces.

![break]

It was Gobta's unit, the affected party, who best understood the change in the current state of affairs.

"Commander Gobta, what should we do?"

"This ain't lookin' good. Let's pull back!"

<Good choice. Since the tides have turned, we don't have to push our luck.>

Gobta had made the correct decision.

'Do not try to force a mission to succeed, and withdraw in the event of an unforeseen situation'---this was a rule that'd been thoroughly taught.

Benimaru, who had been watching the entire time, gave the order to retreat, which made them fully realize the gravity of the situation.

Everyone turned around without missing a beat and fell back at once.

Then, they tried to use 'Shadow Step' to escape---

"Gobta, our enemy is not incompetent. It appears they've sabotaged us with magic so that we can't use 'Shadow Step'."

By the time Ranga warned Gobta about the anomaly he sensed, it was too late. They were already under the influence of the Empire's widespread magic obstruction.

Nobody besides Ranga could break through the trap. Therefore, the only option was to physically run away.

"Everyone! Run to the forest as fast as possible!"

Gobta's facial expression changed as he shouted, and the Goblin Riders obeyed his orders.

They were less than two hundred meters away from the forest.

Normally, it would've only taken a few seconds to reach. However, since they were being shot at from behind, it now felt like an excruciating eternity.

The retreat was going to be fraught with hardship...

![break]

Gaster smiled cruelly as he watched Gobta's group flee. He quickly ordered his subordinates to prepare the tank guns.

*You bastards, don't go thinking that you'll have an easy getaway!*

He planned on using his last special shell. Following Gaster's command, the round was quickly loaded and immediately fired. The special shell landed in the forest in front of Gobta's unit and exploded, scattering fire everywhere. The goal was to block their path. Gobta and his men used their heightened intuition to evade the incoming shell, but they couldn't do anything if the forest they were trying to escape to was burning.

"Ah, this is bad... I wonder if we can make it back alive?"

"Gobta-san, please don't joke around like that. Well, since I'm here, everyone will return safely!"

"Gobto, when I listen to your overly confident and baseless remark, it makes me feel stupid for having been so worried."

"Even Captain Gobta---no, I mean Corps Commander Gobta---has worries?"

"That much is obvious. At best, he'd be wondering about tonight's dinner menu. Or, about how he's gonna apologize to Rigur-san, who discovered that he went out with His Majesty Rimuru."

Gobchi and Gobte both added their two cents, and the Goblin Riders laughed. The situation was hopeless, yet Gobta and the others hadn't lost their usual liveliness. And this conversation between Gobta and his men was overheard by Gaster, who was listening in.

*You inferior fools. Now that the enclosure is complete, your fate is in the palm of my hands!*

Gaster's heart was brimming with burning rage. His gaze was set on a beautiful woman with pure white hair---Testarossa. She was exposed to the explosive heat, but her composure was as cool as a cucumber. She also didn't seem to consider the flying rounds to be a threat at all.

*You too. You ridiculed me here, and I'll never forgive you! I'll turn your beautiful face into a blubbering mess filled with fear!*

Gaster was unaware of his dark desires. He was charmed by Testarossa and didn't even realize that his own judgment had become too extreme. His face twisted into a wicked expression, and Gaster commanded, <Attention, all remaining vehicles! Fire your cannons at the enemy!>

The remaining forces of the left wing were busy attracting Gobta and the others. Although the order ignored their safety, no one disagreed. The remaining thousand tanks rotated their turrets as the barricade of tanks restrained the movement of Gobta's unit. Adjusting the angle and providing anti-shock protection as a measure to shoot from point-blank range---the deadly muzzle that reaps life was about to fire all at once.

![soft scene break]

A fierce battle has begun even in the sky. A number of powerful magic was fired from the airships.

In the face of this, Gabil and his men were at a distinct disadvantage. The problem was that the movement of magicules was being disrupted. Their top-secret weapon, the magic canceler, was affecting not only Gobta's unit, but Gabil's as well.

"Grrr, what a pain in the ass. As soon as we get near those airships, our bodies get heavier and heavier."

"What should we do, Gabil-sama?"

"I want to help Gobta and others, but we can't at the moment."

While the Hiryuu could handle it by themselves, they still had to look after the Wyvern Riders, who had little to no combat experience. If anything went wrong here, both Gobta and Gabil's unit could be destroyed together.

"Argh, we don't have a choice! We have to take out those airships first. We have the numerical advantage. Everyone, focus on the enemy in front of you!"

"Understood, General!"

"But the enemy is bigger than us, aren't they? Even if we compare numbers---"

"Shut up, idiot! Even Gabil-sama has realized it, but he's got no other choice but to give such an order!"

There was someone who killed the mood, but that was the norm. Contrary to the conversation, Gabil and his men were committed to battling the flying fleet.

![break]

A person stared at Gabil's group with ruthless eyes. The leader of the jewel of the Armored Corps, Air Assault Division---Major General Farage. He was a talented man with comparable ambitions. His desire to further his military career was not unique among the other officers.

Nonetheless, Farage thoroughly flattered other colleagues since he was eager not to earn their ire. There was an explanation behind this, of course. He had experienced how his old home, the Magic Corps, had ended.

The Magic Corps was once a force to be reckoned with, yet it was now a dismantled relic of the past. It might be due to a trend of the times, but the main reason was that they were determined to be inefficient in warfare. Magical fights were often thought of as flashy, when in reality it was a very modest task. All the magicians had to do was analyze and interfere with the enemy's magic. At that time, they had to activate their own magic and hit their opponent's army. This was repeated over and over again, and did not produce any significant results. This was because knights reinforced by magic were much stronger than sorcerers when it came down to actual combat.

For example, nuclear magic has been touted as the most powerful type of magic, yet it required more than a dozen magicians to execute. It wasn't something an individual could use, and constructing and casting the spell took up precious time. There were exceptions, such as heroes who could wield nuclear magic by themselves... Nevertheless, the resulting explosion only had a diameter of a hundred meters at best.

In essence, a mage could not be expected to play an active role on the battlefield. Furthermore, although having additional magicians was advantageous, more did not always translate to better. This was due to the fact that magicules floating around the battlefield was finite, and once it was all expended, magicians became useless. Mages were an indispensable existence, but they were unarguably a mediocre existence.

Farage was also a brilliant wizard and one of Master Gadra's students. He respected his master, Gadra, valued his teachings, and never neglected his own diligence. However, he realized something. As the Armored Corps became modernized with the help of Master Gadra, the Magic Corps found fewer and fewer opportunities to play an active role.

This era no longer required well-trained magicians. With the advent of spell guns, even ordinary humans could manipulate magic.

Farage hated Gadra. He asserted that his master's actions were strangling them. Yet, Gadra promptly rejected his concerns. As a result, the Magic Corps continually declined---

*That's why I betrayed my teacher and swore allegiance to Calgurio-sama.*

And that was how he obtained his current position.

He accepted his former subordinates, who were all talented magicians, and gave them active roles to play. He wanted the Air Assault Division to one day become the strongest. Until that happened, Farage thought to make sure his colleagues were in a good mood and kept a low profile for himself. He had always been a self-disciplined person.

Then finally, the perfect opportunity appeared: Operation Subjugate Veldora. And, at the heart of it all stood the Air Assault Division. The essence of the mission was to contain Veldora using the magic canceler. Besides that, they would also assist other troops.

Their original role was to provide logistical support, but they were excused from that job this time. In fact, 300 of the 400 airships were on different missions, and the remaining 100 were filled to the brim with elite magicians.

It was a configuration centered solely on combat, which demonstrated how crucial the operation's success was to Calgurio. Farage was well aware of the fact that this mission needed to be carried out at all costs.

*This is where we will distinguish ourselves and prove our usefulness. A new era is about to begin!*

Farage chuckled to himself.

And if that was the case, there was no need to take heed of the other officers' feelings anymore. With their positions reversed, no one would be able to ignore Farage's wishes. He had no doubt that this was his destiny.

*Those flying lizards and crawling dogs aren't nearly enough of a warmup before defeating Veldora, but that's fine,* Farage pondered. *We'll simply use them as practice for our new weapon.*

"What do you want to share the credit for? I'm the one who owes you a favor, Gaster-dono!" Farage shouted loudly while holding a glass of wine.

"Everyone! We've been patiently enduring everything up until this point, but that ends today! Let's show them our true power!"

" " "Yeaaah!!" " " the crew members shouted enthusiastically.

Although they were originally elite magicians, they couldn't bear the reality of experiencing hardships. The humiliation they suffered would be wiped away by the glory days that began now.

Everyone felt the same way. With that common belief running through their mind, the one hundred airships strengthened their efforts...

![break]

The biggest feature of the airship was the magic canceler generator, but it was also equipped with state-of-the-art weaponry. It was controlled by mages versed in elemental and summoning magic.

The makeup of the airship was roughly divided into three departments: the operations, defense, and offensive. A hundred men were assigned to each of them, and the remaining hundred were held in reserve, where they worked on communication and medical affairs.

Needless to say, the operations department operated the airship. A minimum of fifty people were required to fly the ship, but even a hundred personnel was insufficient if they wanted to operate the craft at full strength.

The defense department was in charge of the airship's 'Defense Barrier' and dealt with a variety of attacks such as anti-physics, anti-magic, and anti-element. The hull of the ship was kept thin in order to save weight. If they neglected to defend the airship with reinforcement magic, then they could easily be shot down. They were a critical department.

Last was the offensive department, the star of the show. One of the weapons installed on the airship was the magic-amplifying cannon, and this also served to facilitate cooperation between magicians. Multiple magicians could supply the mana orb on the pedestal with their mana at the same time. By chanting magic simultaneously, they could control powerful magic rather easily.

There was a total of five magic-amplifying cannons, one located in the front and two on either side of the ship, with a maximum number of ten mages per gun awaiting orders. Substitute magicians were located in seats behind so that the cannon could be fired continuously. It was worth noting that the power of the cannon increased in proportion to the number of users. For instance, if two people powered it, then it was four times stronger. Thus, if ten mages operated it consecutively, then the output would increase by a factor of 20.

This was a menace. Even a simple fireball would become more powerful than a greater magic fireball. It went without saying how much potential this possessed.

![break]

The airship's defenses were flawless. The wyverns' fireballs were like spitballs, and the barrier even prevented any attacks from hitting the body. Half-baked attacks didn't work and that satisfied Farage. Furthermore, its offensive capabilities---

"Airships are the strongest of them all. It's time to show your true potential. Swat those unsightly lizards out of the sky with maximum power!" Farage passionately appealed.

So far, only two or three mages on each cannon had been chanting magic. But the time for tests was over. The real show was about to begin. The magic-amplifying cannon was activated by channeling mana into a spell control jewel. The jewel was about 50 centimeters in diameter and made of high-purity magic stone.

The magicians who had been standing idly by now held out their hands and, with the combined might of ten people, unleashed large-scale magic. Lightning, ice, snow, flames, vacuum blades, and other terrifying magic blasted into the sky with a tremendous power 20 times greater than normal.

![hard scene break]

I had been watching the battle intently when I suddenly got up from my chair.

Gobta's subordinates were being blown away by tank guns. Faced with overwhelming and extensive magic, Gabil's men went down one after another. The battle intensified and injuries began to appear.

*No, I always knew that there were going to be injuries. I knew it, yet I couldn't help but be optimistic.*

I'd once said, "We will win no matter what!"

Benimaru was brimming with confidence, and even Raphael-san had no objections, so I naively believed that we wouldn't run into any issues. However, reality was often different.

*Of course it is. Because this is war.*

It was impossible to win without sustaining at least some damage to our side. I felt angry and impatient at my own rose-colored naivety.

"Please sit down, Rimuru-sama. This is expected and there is nothing wrong," Benimaru told me with a calm expression.

Something about his words hit a nerve in me.

"You sure created a lot of casualties! That's why I should've used Megiddo to back you up---"

---No, we'd already decided against that.

While Megiddo was certainly effective, we came to the conclusion that it was still unusable. Benimaru also questioned its effectiveness, and even Diablo was against it.

There were a few reasons. First of all, since we'd decided to move forward as a nation, we couldn't keep relying on our demon lord---in other words, me---forever. Benimaru asserted that the demon lord was responsible for protecting monsters under his rule, and on the flip side, it was the subordinates' duty to protect the country. The other executives also agreed that if they wanted to recognize Tempest as their own country, yet were unwilling to protect it, then they had no right to live here.

"Rimuru-sama doesn't have to shoulder everything alone," Shuna reminded.

When I heard that, I felt happy and agreed with her sentiment.

That was the first reason. The second reason was Megiddo's weaknesses that Diablo pointed out.

"This Megiddo is very beautiful magic; it has a low cost but high output power, and it is versatile while remaining easy to use. However, once you know of its existence, you can take measures to protect yourself."

That was Diablo's argument. We could activate it while we were in the Control Room, and it definitely would've been useful this time around too. Nevertheless, if our secret was revealed, then it wouldn't work next time. As Hinata had pointed out, if someone blew up a big dust cloud, that alone would reduce the accuracy and power.

The fact that Diablo was able to get Hinata's opinion demonstrated his frightening ability at information gathering, but let's put that aside for later.

The last time Megiddo was used, everyone was killed. Except for Edmalis and Razen---they were the only two survivors. Still, they had a gag order, so there was no real danger of information being leaked. But circumstances were different this time. There was no way we could keep hundreds of thousands of Imperial soldiers in the dark.

"We should also hold onto a trump card," Benimaru had advised.

Diablo and Benimaru's opinion was that we shouldn't carelessly use such tremendous and stunning magic.

Their explanation convinced me. Megiddo was a super-heated ray made of sunlight and it was almost impossible to avoid by sight. As an anti-personnel magic, it was only effective when used under the right situation.

On the other hand, our opponents weren't living beings, but rather iron tanks. That wasn't to say Megiddo wouldn't work, but it'd undoubtedly be illogical. Raphael-san had also determined that destroying a tank would take an impractical amount of time.

Unless the power was increased---that is, the focal temperature of the heat ray was focused to tens of thousands of degrees or more---the tank couldn't be penetrated. Also, since none of the tanks ran on oil, they wouldn't explode and burn like one would typically expect.

If tanks couldn't be stopped just by penetrating it with a single heat ray, then it had to be continually hit until it was full of holes and broke down. At that point, it'd be easier to blow it up with nuclear magic than to do such a repetitive task.

![break]

In that case, we needed to break through multiple layers of anti-magic barriers, and the magician who casted it would have to be dealt with first, which eventually led to a drawn-out magic battle...which made it tactically meaningless. It would've never worked.

Thus, other than giving Benimaru the right to command, all I had to do was to watch.

However...

"I should join the war as well---" I mumbled, but was immediately interrupted.

"That's forbidden. As the overall commander, I cannot allow the king to be exposed to danger. More importantly, there was something in the story that the Hero Chloe shared that interested me. In the other timeline, somebody had murdered Rimuru-sama. Armed with the knowledge that such a threatening person exists, it is impossible to ask Rimuru-sama to fight on the battlefield."

All the executives knew that there was a dangerous person on the enemies' side because I had shared the story and how it was a possible future outcome.

*What was their reaction when they found out?*

The answer was obvious when I looked at Benimaru's face.

"At the moment," Souei began, "the most likely threats are the commanders of the three divisions and the one hundred members of the Imperial Guardians. There may be other strong individuals hidden that we are unaware about, so we are currently investigating. Please forgive us for being pusillanimous."

Souei and the others were currently in the process of gathering information at the risk of their own lives.

And it was all for me---in order to eliminate threats against me.

"Now that the enemy's strength is unknown, sending our king, Rimuru-sama, as the vanguard is out of the question. The operation is still proceeding without any problems, so please trust in me, Gobta, and Gabil."

With that, I sank back down into my chair.

Although this unpleasant feeling, which was neither anger nor frustration, did not disappear, Benimaru's words were right on the mark.

*Yeah.* Come to think of it, Benimaru had accounted for me from the very beginning when he was contemplating on how to carry out the operation.

Benimaru wasn't the only one; Shion, who was standing behind me, and Souei, who was standing beside me, were all aware. Diablo was an obvious one, but even Shuna, who looked at me worriedly, and everyone else---I realized that they were all prepared to lose those who left to fight forever.

It wasn't just limited to the people who were right here; perhaps the ones clashing on the front lines had realized it as well.

*Use yourselves as bait*---the thought must've run through their minds as they stood on the battlefield, resigned to sacrifice themselves in order to attract a threat they had yet to see.

And the reason why the usually selfish Veldora was sitting quietly in the Control Room: he was there as insurance on the off chance that something happened here.

---Everything was set up to protect me, the king of this country.

I was the only one who wasn't ready...

At that moment---

![break]

<<That's why I have to be perfect.>>

![break]

---I thought I heard a voice somewhere.

*Even* you *were worried about me?*

But I was fine now.

My sadness would only be disrespectful to those who had resolved themselves.

Thus, I had to resolve myself as well.

"I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking straight..." I apologized to Benimaru, and he nodded in response.

"Don't worry. Victory will definitely be yours, Rimuru-sama," Benimaru promised with a fearless smile.

It was the serious look of a general who'd been entrusted with the lives of his men.

When I heard those words, the frustration, conflict, and other unpleasant feelings in me disappeared. I'd always been ready to kill my enemies and for my own death. Yet, I'd never even considered the thought of someone dying for my sake. I needed to accept it. The deed wasn't only for my own sake; I was in a position that symbolized their families, and the framework of a nation that protected and defended them. That was why I *had* to accept that thought.

In return for their actions, defeat would never be tolerated. A symbol was always a symbol, and with it, there was an appropriate way to conduct oneself. With that in mind, I replied to Benimaru in a composed manner so that I would appear calm.

"Of course. I'd like to tell them all what I said. Is that okay?"

"---Please do!"

With Benimaru's consent and cooperation, I transmitted my "will" to all my subordinates. His Unique Skill 'Generalissimo' allowed me to convey my words directly to them.

<Listen up! Crush the enemy with all your might. There is no need to go easy on them. Naturally, that means there is also no need to show any mercy. Use everything you've got and eliminate the enemy as quickly as possible!>

I gave the order with all of my heart. Benimaru nodded at my words. Smiles appeared on the faces of the other executives. The order meant only one thing.

![break]

We would no longer hold back our suppressed power.

![break]

Having understood the meaning of my words correctly, the monsters resumed their activities. And, as a result---the war was about to change drastically.
