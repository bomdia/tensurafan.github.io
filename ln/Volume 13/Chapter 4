# Chapter 4: Total Victory

It had been seven days since the labyrinth siege had started.

The labyrinth swallowed every soldier that tried to go in, and yet it remained silent.

Calgurio spent his time being annoyed at how he had not yet received any report from inside. His act of annoyance was for concealing the instinctive fear growing from within him.

They were still unable to get in touch with the other units, in addition, they had lost contact with the inside of the labyrinth. On the face of it, they were completely isolated in enemy territory. This situation made Calgurio uneasy.

"Is nobody going to return yet?!" He even shouted, still no one answered.

Silence was his only reply.

Not only Calgurio, but also his staff, understood that the situation was not good. On the first day, they had dispatched soldiers countless times, and they were able to bring out information from inside. Although not one soldier had returned, they had been able to communicate with them inside at first. With every information collected, they had gotten a rough idea of what was going on inside.

Upon entering the labyrinth, one needed to verify their identity. Then, the conditions for clearing the labyrinth would be presented to you.

![break]

*Defeat the Dungeon's Elite Ten and you can collect the ten keys. With the ten keys, it is said that you can obtain the right to challenge the king. And once you defeat the king, the labyrinth shall be cleared.*

![break]

Initially, this was considered simple. However, now that judgement, without a doubt, had been a grave misunderstanding. Based on the information collected, the labyrinth had at least more than 50 floors.

The floors changed for every 1000 men, but the soldiers were received in a regular rotation. This allowed them to make contact with the soldiers that had already gone inside. However, their first contact was when the number of soldiers that had entered was already more than 50,000.

Based on how many times the labyrinth was entered, it could be inferred that there were 54 floors or more.

According to Yuuki, Shinji's team had reported that the labyrinth had 60 floors, but that information was quickly established to be unreliable. After all, the strength of the monsters in the labyrinth was completely different from what they had said.

To begin with, the moment it was said that the boss of the labyrinth was a wight king, the story of Shinji's group had already lost its credibility. It was because a report that came on day 2 had informed them that a floor that was ruled by a wight king was discovered.

*Apparently, that wight king was one of Dungeon's Elite Ten...* Some were even saying the rumors may be true. Now, anyone laughing about those rumors was gone.

"Even with the best of the elites, it's no good, huh..."

"Yes. If this continues, the conquest will end in failure."

Calgurio shivered; he couldn't accept the situation. Because the conquest ending in a failure was an understatement. It was so much worse than that; it would mean the death of 530,000 soldiers. He could not just easily abandon the invaluable soldiers Emperor Rudra had entrusted to him.

It has been only seven days. There was still time to reach the limit, and the attack was still going on in the labyrinth. They just had to wait and believe.

That should be the right thing to do, but Calgurio, or rather, not only Calgurio but all the general staffs, felt that it was not a good idea to continue.

What made them think that way was the existence of "Elite Ten".

Currently, there were four keys that they had obtained. The monsters were said to resurrect whether they were defeated or not, but they had succeeded in obtaining keys from the four dragon kings.

However, as for the remaining six, there was no way to defeat them.

The wight king, and the death paladin who seemed to be his right hand were some of them. Then there was the queen who rules the insects plus the lady of the beasts. Then there was the offensive Elemental Colossus, nicknamed the ghost of Gadra.

The identity of the last one, for example, was unknown.

Unless these six were defeated, clearing the labyrinth would be nothing but a pipe dream. With the forces inside the labyrinth, it was impossible to achieve their goals---Calgurio agreed, and the general staff were unanimous in their opinion.

"But it's no use deploying all of our forces in this situation..."

"Yes."

"That will only wear us down. Besides, the defenses here will be insecure."

So, what should be done? There was only one answer. The only way was to attack the labyrinth the way it was supposed to be attacked---with an elite team.

But then, the question became who to choose.

Calgurio, after some deliberation, decided to gather the best from among the corps. He gathered a hundred men and women. He recruited only the best and the strongest of each unit.

Sitting in the front row was a graceful, elegant man. Even on the battlefield, he wore a straightened uniform. His name was Minits, the man Calgurio relied on the most, and he held the high position of Major General. He was recommended by Calgurio as the commander of this operation.

Next to Minits sat a grinning man with a cigarette in his mouth. His fearless gaze, as if he were staring at his prey, and his well-groomed beard inspired a sense of awe to those who encountered him. He was also a man who was capable enough not to betray such feelings. Colonel Kansas. He was a champion who had left behind many, many brilliant achievements. The most famous among them was the "animal beast" extermination campaign. The man who led this mission was Kansas himself.

His attitude was very self-confident, perhaps as a sign of his achievements. Even in the presence of his superiors, he showed no sign of fear. No one around him paid any mind to warn Kansas. It was no wonder, after all, Minits who was Kansas's immediate superior even tolerated his attitude.

Calgurio had his own feelings about this, but he did not think it was worth complaining to the famous champion of the empire. He left the matter in the hands of Minits, the superior, and there was no one here to criticize Kansas's actions.

The other two famous people were Lucius and Raymond.

These two were otherworlders.

Lucius had the Unique Skill 'Fusionist'. He was good at using his power to attack with high firepower and was well-known among the imperial army.

Raymond had the Unique Skill 'Martial Artist'. He was a former martial artist, who seemed to become integrated with his Skill. He was a top-notch warrior who could use all kinds of weapons, martial arts, and even Art which he learned in this world.

These four were the most famous elites, but the others chosen were also great warriors. They were all of A rank at the very least, and were the elite of the elites, one in ten thousand in the Imperial Army.

These hundred alone were capable of destroying the knights of other countries. Calgurio had decided to entrust the entire operation to these champions.

"Now then, everyone. You have heard the situation, haven't you?"

They nodded silently. Some men like Kansas grinned, but most of them listened to Calgurio's words with serious expressions.

"In the labyrinth, our comrades are waiting for our help. In order to leave the labyrinth, we must fulfill a condition, and that condition includes defeating the demon lord. Our Armored Corps, the strongest in the empire, will be able to solve this problem. However! We can't be wasting our time."

This labyrinth was not a place that could be conquered with just a few troops. Calgurio understood this, but he could not say so honestly. He explained the situation to his men in a way that was not too flippant, because such an act would be demoralizing.

"Defeat the Elite Ten or something like that in the labyrinth and collect the ten keys. If you do so, you will have the right to challenge Demon Lord Rimuru. That is exactly what I expect you to do. I ask you to defeat the demon lord!" Calgurio spoke up in front of the elite of the Armored Corps.

"Calgurio-sama, the demon lord is no enemy to our glorious Imperial Army. Let us prove it now!" Minits, the highest in rank, answered on behalf of the others. With a graceful gesture, he promised victory.

There was no one here who could disagree with such a Minits. They were all proud of their skills, and all of them were confident of their victory.

And so, the brave men were chosen to challenge the demon lord.

They just did not know.

It was because they did not know that they were still able to hope.

It was because they did not know that they were blind to the dangers of the labyrinth.

The right thing to do at this moment would have been to retreat.

But now it was too late.

Calgurio's decision had come too late.

The battle in the labyrinth had already ended, and there was no one left alive in the labyrinth.

They had no idea that such a thing had already happened...

The chosen heroes entered the daunting labyrinth with high spirits.

![hard scene break]

We were finally able to catch our breath from our fascination at the images on the big-screen.

I guess I had been right. Interestingly enough, the imperials ignored the warnings on the gate. They sent even more soldiers into the labyrinth than we had expected.

"That's great! This is more than we expected!" I muttered to myself, and Benimaru nodded.

"No one has been strong enough to warrant our attention. It's probably because the Dungeon's Elite Ten are so strong, but this is going to be easier than we thought."

He said as such and there was no caution in his eyes. He seemed to have switched his attention to the ground.

"It looks like there's been another movement."

"Yes. This time they're not relying on numbers, they're being selective. They should have made their decision earlier anyway. Then the labyrinthine forces would have had a harder time..."

"Hey, hey, that's good for us though, isn't it?"

"Well, yes, that's true. But when things go so well, it makes me nervous..."

Benimaru was saying something like this, but his expression seemed to indicate that he believed the result to be a foregone conclusion.

That was not the issue...

He just wanted the empire to do well because he was going to be out of the spotlight, didn't he?

I wasn't sure if I understood how he felt or not...

No, no. If I did, that would make me a combat maniac too.

I'm not like Benimaru and the others.

I'm happy with these results.

Besides, as I have said many times before, in this world, quality is more important than quantity. We could consider these selected units as the main force of the enemy. There was a high possibility that they would destroy Elite Ten individually, so this was not the time to fool around.

The goal was to thin out the enemy forces.

This had been accomplished sufficiently already. The number of the Imperial forces was now only a few hundred thousand, and the had been reduced to a level that even the Western Nations could cope with.

That was the main thing.

As was true betting, the strategy was to win a big victory at the beginning and make the enemy lose their chance to stop the game. The image of victory became so big that it gave the illusion that one could recover even if they lost a lot. Even if they became aware of it, it was hard to stop.

This is exactly what had happened to the Imperial Army this time, and as a result of repeated successive introductions of forces, they had put in all their forces to the point of irreversible defeat.

As for us, we were very thankful to have achieved our goal so far, but we had not yet achieved our goal of weeding out the other strongmen. There were some powerful ones, but none of them seemed like they would be able to defeat me.

Well, I had not been a demon lord in Chloe's story, so I guess I was not so different in strength from the time when I was defeated by Hinata then... Still, I didn't see anyone who even felt like much of a threat.

If I had to say so, I would say that Testarossa killed the legendary-grade players.

Davis, the eleventh rank, might have been able to kill me. Of course, not the me now, but the me from when I first fought with Hinata. After all, the person in question had not been seen yet, so that was the conclusion.

I would just put that on hold for now since there was no point in thinking about it.

What I was interested in now was what the enemy commander was thinking. If the situation was so miserable, they would normally choose to retreat... I wondered what the enemy commander was thinking.

![break]

<<Answer. Since the communication with other units has been blocked, they may not be fully aware of the current situation. They are presumably clinging to an impossible hope and have not given up on victory.>>

![break]

Oops, Wisdom King Raphael-san was a bit harsh.

I guess that made sense. But then again, too much control over information warfare was also a bad idea. If the commander had known what was going on, he might have retreated early.

![break]

<<Negative. If we don't hit them thoroughly when we can, it will leave a lasting grudge. There is no need to show mercy to the intruder.>>

![break]

That's a harsh statement. It sounds rational and ruthless, but I think it is also correct. If we left a large force behind, the empire would not give up their ambition. But if we beat them thoroughly, we can avoid war, at least for the time being.

Doing things halfway was not the best way to go about anything. The enemy had families too, and those who were left behind would be sad. But... By making them realize their own stupidity, we may be able to deter future wars. This was not justice by any means, but at least it was the right thing to do in terms of eliminating skirmishes.

Well, it was too late for anything now. In my case, unlike Wisdom King Raphael-san, I was indecisive. If the enemy ran away, I would let them do as they liked, and if they attacked again, I would crush them.

Perhaps I was still naive to leave the decision-making to others. I understood it, but it was my nature, and I couldn't fix it so easily. The truth was that I didn't want them to attack me, and I hoped they wouldn't give me any trouble.

As I was lamenting secretly in my mind, I received a call from Ramiris.

<Rimuru, is this a good time?>

<Yes, yes. This is Rimuru, no problem.> From the tone of her voice, it did not sound urgent, but what could it be about?

<Well, you know, another hundred or so are coming, right?>

<It seems so. They seem to be stronger enemies this time.>

<Yeah, yeah. So, I got a request from the Elite Ten.>

I heard what Ramiris had to say.

Request No.1 was proposed by Gadra. Apparently, he knew someone who was one of the intruders into the labyrinth. Their names were Lucius and Raymond, and they were otherworlders. He said he would try to persuade them to join our group somehow.

Request No.2 was proposed by Kumara. Kumara had also seen a familiar face among the intruders. Unlike Gadra, however, he was not an acquaintance, but rather, he was the target of a vendetta. He was said to be the one who destroyed "Youma (animal beast) Township", the hometown of Kumara and her friends, and sold Kumara to Demon Lord Clayman at a very young age, though she was almost 300 years old at that time. The man who sold her. I didn't know that such a vicious bastard was a member of the Imperial Army.

These were the only two requests they had, but I wasn't sure what to do.

"What do you think, Benimaru?"

"Well, attacking with masses is the shortcut to victory, but it's not exactly pretty. I know that there is nothing clean or dirty in war, but I think we should grant the requests, don't you? If Gadra can convince them, that's good enough, and if we fail, it won't hurt us that much."

"That's true. Since we're going to spread out our forces anyway, let's leave those two to Gadra. And as for Kumara..."

"No one wants to be hindered in their revenge," he said. Benimaru's words carried weight when he said that.

Kumara, by the way, had been manipulated by Clayman's Demon Dominate spell. It was natural that she would want to take revenge if the man who caused this came right to her.

Although people say that revenge brings you nothing, it can give you a way to vent. It would be better to confront this than to hold on to the feelings you have.

So, I approved of it.

<Ramiris, I approve.>

<Great! You're the man, Rimuru, you know what you're talking about!>

<We want to spread out the forces anyway, so we'll have only Lucius and Raymond at Gadra's area. Kumara's area...>

<That bearded guy! I don't know what his name is, but he's got a nasty look on his face.>

Ramiris was completely on Kumara's side.

But I felt the same way.

<Send him in. And tell Kumara to do her best!>

<Ok! I'll take care of it.>

Thus, the requests were accepted. As for the distribution of the remaining forces...

"Looks like that guy over there is in command. Rimuru-sama, leave him all alone and let Apito clean him up."

Benimaru said such cruel things without hesitation.

How could he so easily suggest such a strategy when he had said earlier that it was not beautiful to attack and bully with the masses?

Well, I agreed with his opinion, nonetheless.

<Ramiris, I heard that that fashionable middle-aged guy over there is the commander, so lets send him to Apito's place all alone.>

<I see. We're going to take away his ability to lead and make them lose cohesion. Rimuru's got some dirty tricks up his sleeve.>

---What?

So I turned out to be the bad guy?

I was shocked, but Ramiris seemed convinced on her own.

<Well then, I guess Adalmann can take care of the remaining hundred or so, right?>

<I agree! My dragon kings lost, but everyone else is still doing their best. I'll ask them to keep up the good work until the end!>

Ramiris seemed a little disappointed, but it could not be helped. Even the dragon lords had a bad time against the oncoming army. Unlike the other Elite Ten, the hierarchy of the terrain effect was vast. They had played an important role in terms of harassment, but they lost their advantage when the information was shared, and countermeasures were taken.

In such a situation, I thought they did a good job. Although they lost four of the keys, six Elite Ten members were still undefeated. I would let them keep up the good work.

<I'll leave it to you! But be on your guard. There may be some dangerous ones among those 100.>

<Don't worry, don't worry! Everyone was all excited to hear that Rimuru was watching them. Besides, the king of the labyrinth is Master Veldora.>

That was true. The condition to clear the labyrinth this time was "to collect 10 keys, challenge the king of the labyrinth, and win." I couldn't imagine Veldora being defeated, so I felt we could rest assured about that.

<I guess so. Well then, keep up the good work!>

<Leave it to us!>

With those cheerful words, Ramiris ended the 'Telepathy Net'.

Well then, now it was time to take a break.

I turned my attention back to the big screen to watch the final battle.

![hard scene break]

Lucius and Raymond sat on the stairs, breathing hard and drinking water.

According to the report, there was no monster on the stairs. It was dangerous to believe, but they still rested, thinking that they were safer than the others.

.........

......

...

General Calgurio had called them and ordered them to enter the labyrinth. They had no complaints about that.

Lucius and his friends, like Shinji and his friends, were otherworlders picked up by Gadra. They felt indebted to Gadra for helping them to make a living in this world where they did not know what was right and wrong.

That same Gadra had gone missing.

He seemed to have gone to Demon Lord Rimuru's territory on a mission with a special team.

Gadra had returned, but all the other team members had not returned yet. Gadra had reported to Yuuki that his companion was killed in battle.

After that, even Gadra disappeared.

Rumors had been circulating that he had gone on his way to rescue his teammates. It was a little hard to believe this rumor from the point of view of those who knew Gadra, but if that was true, they could not leave him behind.

Besides...

The people who accompanied Gadra, who were said to have died in the war, were people whom Lucius and the others knew very well.

They were Shinji Tanimura, Mark Lauren, and Xin Liuxing, three of their fellow countrymen whom they had become friends with having come from another world.

It was a bit hard to believe, but in fact, Shinji and the others did not return. Their mission was to investigate the labyrinth, and they believed that something must have happened there with the Demon Lord Rimuru.

It was reasonable to assume that Shinji and the other three who challenged Demon Lord Rimuru were killed as a result.

Some of their fellow countrymen were saddened by the loss of Shinji and the others. Lucius and Raymond, and many others. Just because they were from the same place, there was a mysterious sense of solidarity that lasted among them.

Besides, Shinji was a surprisingly kind man who was a leader and never left anyone in need of help. Although he was a bit insensitive, there were even people who looked up to him.

There was a debt of gratitude he had received from Gadra. In addition, he wanted to know about the safety of his close friends.

After discussing these thoughts with his friends, it was decided that Lucius and Raymond, the two with the greatest fighting ability, would go into hiding during this expedition.

They immediately submitted their opinions to Yuuki, but their request was rejected.

*"It is really dangerous to act now. It's a bit of a mess, and it's better not to make any moves. I can't tell you the details, but I'm sure Shinji and the others are safe."*

They did not take it seriously.

If Yuuki said it is dangerous, it must be really dangerous. However, there were some who were not convinced. If they were left alone, they might jump out on their own, and it was believed that Lucius and Raymond, who were still specialized in fighting, would be able to deal with such a situation if something happened.

For this reason, Lucius decided to act on his own. Raymond agreed with him, and the two of them went into action without telling Yuuki.

They were reassigned from the Mixed Corps to Armored Corps and engaged in this operation.

Because of this situation, the order from Calgurio was just what they wanted...

.........

......

...

"It may have been a mistake to go inside."

"Well, yeah. I didn't expect the enemy to be this strong."

They were sent to the 59th floor.

Unbeknownst to the two of them, there was a plan to call them up to the 60th floor out of the blue.

However, there was a possibility that these two were hiding their abilities. It was also possible that someone might be in disguise, so the plan was to wait and see.

Incidentally, this was the plan of Rimuru---or rather 'Wisdom King Raphael'.

Ramiris and Gadra were also convinced that Rimuru was being cautious.

For this reason, Lucius and his team were exposed to a fierce battle at the 59th floor.

Variable laser cannons and sonic cannons. And many other scientific weapons. Once the Isolation Wall was down, a tasteless, odorless, poison-gas-generating corridor was prepared.

Many of the weapons created in the 95-floor laboratory, which now had 100 floors, were in operation on the 59th floor.

And the most impressive thing of all was a humanoid weapon specialized for offensive attacks, the majin form (golem).

Rimuru brought back the materials from the ruins of "Amalita" discovered in Puppet Nation Jistav. The defense mechanism that Rimuru had them study and reproduce had been put to full use here.

Weapons that did not require even ten percent of their functions even when they were used to destroy the imperial army. They were now used to test Lucius and Raymond.

A serious battle ensued, with both men exposing their full arsenal.

Raymond stood at the vanguard, buying time.

With that precious time, Lucius delivered the killing blow.

Lucius' 'Fusionist' was as effective as its name suggested. He could mix matter and extract energy from it. Depending on its use, it could be used for attacks equivalent to nuclear magic.

It was Gadra who discovered and taught him this technique. Lucius fought desperately, remembering the debt he owed to his mentor.

The battle itself was a great victory for both of them. Neither the golems nor the scientific weaponry was a match for the massive destructive force of the attack. However, the number of these weapons was too great. It was very difficult for the two of them to break through all these traps alone, and it was no wonder that Lucius and Raymond were exhausted after only one day.

"Hey... What should we do? Shall we go on?"

"Don't be silly. We've only gone down one flight of stairs. It's dangerous to go down there without any countermeasures when there's so many weapons and traps."

"That's true. But we don't have any other choice, do we? We lost the others as soon as we entered the labyrinth..."

Raymond was right. Even Lucius understood that, but he couldn't do anything about it.

It was dangerous to go forward, but what was the right thing to do?

There was no guarantee that they would get out of the labyrinth even if they went up instead of down. Rather, if they were to believe in the confirmation of intention from when they entered the labyrinth, it seemed to be impossible to escape from the labyrinth unless they fulfilled the conditions to clear the labyrinth.

"There's no way we can clear this labyrinth..."

"Well, yes. It might be so if we had time, but it would take more than a month to clear the labyrinth, even if we do one floor a day. It's not much, but we don't have enough food."

That was the main problem.

Lucius and Raymond had not undergone remodeling surgery, so they needed to eat. Water would be manageable, but there were only 20 days of food left. If the monsters were not released as in the previous hierarchy, there was no way to eat their flesh and blood.

At this rate, they might not last three weeks.

It was only a day since they had entered, and the situation had already begun to look hopelessly bleak.

But they did not give up.

They had one goal in mind: to gather information about their former teacher and friend. If they would have given up at this point, they would not have entered the labyrinth in the first place.

"Hey, do you think you can trust this handout we were given before we entered?"

Lucius asked Raymond, pointing at his throat. His finger pointed to a necklace, which was given to him by Calgurio before the labyrinthine entry operation.

It seemed to be a prototype made in the development room, a replica of the revival item that Gadra had brought back. It was said to be able to revive people even if they died in the labyrinth, but Lucius did not trust it.

"I don't trust it. Even if we could be revived, where would we come back to life?"

"Well, let's say we come back to life. If we comes back to life on the same spot, it would be in front of the monster who killed us. They haven't experimented with that yet, have they?"

"Yeah. We're going to have to experiment on ourselves. So why hang it around your neck? I heard it was brought back as a bracelet."

"I guess that proves that the technology of the empire is still in its infancy."

It was explained that the size of the replica was increased because it was a hastily made imitation. However, this only served to fuel the distrust between the two men.

It would be a crime to entrust one's life to a counterfeit item.

*"This item is for the chosen ones only. I highly value you all for your trustworthiness!"* Calgurio had been using words like this, but it meant that the results have not been confirmed. Since there was no provision for the soldiers at the end, they would have to wait and see what would happen.

At least, if they had experimental data, they could be trusted, but it was foolish to use themselves as the test subjects.

"We can see what happens if we die first."

"That's a laughable joke. At the very least, I'm not going to rely on it." Raymond replied pragmatically.

"Anyway, the 'Resurrection Bracelet' that this is based on is a power of Demon Lord Ramiris, isn't it? If it's a fake, it might offend the other party even more."

When Raymond continued, Lucius cowered his shoulders and agreed with him.

They came to the conclusion as a matter of course that they would act as if they could not come back to life if they died. The only thing they could rely on was their own ability. So, they stood up with a wry smile on their faces.

"Shall we go?"

"Yeah. We'll go as far as we can. If we don't make it, maybe they'll forgive us."

"Really? Shinji would have laughed, but he said..."

"Don't do that. I'd just forgotten about it."

"Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. I'm more afraid of him than I am of the labyrinth."

"Oh, come on, you're showing your true feelings too much just because you haven't been heard. Well, I agree with you though."

"Is that right? I was always impressed by Shinji's insensitivity. He was so enthusiastic about this project and yet he ignored it so nicely."

"Agreed. But that's just like Shinji. That's how he is, too."

"Well, yeah. Shinji is a great guy. He seems like he would survive just fine."

"Yes, that's right!"

A smile appeared on both of their faces. They held on to hope in spite of the situation, and clearly saw the path they had to take. With bright smiles on their faces, they began to descend the stairs. They had no idea of what awaited them on the way.

And then...

"Hey, hey! Lucius, and Raymond-kun, we need to talk to you about something!"

"That's right. It doesn't hurt to listen, you know?"

"You should listen to it."

Lucius and Raymond were surprised to be greeted by Shinji and the others, and they froze.

"Well, you seem very surprised. Let me ask you to do the same. Can you listen to what I have to say first?"

From the huge Elemental Colossus towering in front of them, they heard a familiar voice. The voice was undoubtedly Gadra, to whom Lucius and the others felt indebted.

"You---You're alive, then?"

"I mean---what does this mean?"

What started next was a battle of persuasion from Gadra and the others.

It would take a few more minutes for the two confused people to fall.

![hard scene break]

Gadra's persuasion seemed to have succeeded surprisingly easily. Shinji and the others, who had announced their non-participation in the war, also participated in the persuasion. Thanks to their efforts, it seemed that the other side agreed to our proposal without any trouble.

Lucius and Raymond, Gadra's disciples and Shinji's friends. I had a chance to test their abilities at the 59th floor, but it was Lucius who was the most dangerous.

His skill was a foul one. It looked as if he was popping off something with a finger bullet, but what came out of it was a small explosion---a limited nuclear explosion itself. It was a small reaction, but the power was incredible.

Unique Skill 'Fusionist'---the ability to transform matter and fuse it with other matter. A way to use this skill was to transform a small piece of rubble and throw it at an enemy to blow up the enemy itself.

Even if a 'Barrier' or some other device was used to bounce off the debris, it would explode as soon as it fell to the ground. It could be avoided with a clever dodge, but that would be difficult to do since the gravel used by Lucius was small enough to bounce of his toes. In the first place, it was difficult to even pop off, since it could not react to the transformed gravel.

It was extremely vicious. It was a method of attack that could engulf the user if they made a mistake, but it had been well studied. I didn't know what kind of training he had gotten, but he seemed to have a perfect sense of detection.

And then there was Raymond, who was working with Lucius.

Raymond's fighting skills were excellent, and his shield was also wonderful. I was fascinated by the way he blocked all the attacks from the front.

Raymond's shield was able to block even the shockwaves of the explosions caused by Lucius. They were a good combination of characteristics.

There was no sign that he was disguised as someone else, and we could be sure that it was him. There was also no sign of mental manipulation, and it seemed that the purpose of their visit this time was really to rescue Gadra and Shinji.

Both of them seemed trustworthy, and frankly, I was glad to have them on my side. We were going to have them work for Shinji and his group as trainees for a while. I didn't think there was any danger of betrayal, but it was just a precautionary measure. After seeing how they did, I would upgrade them to the same rank as Shinji and the others.

So things were going well on the 60th floor.

Now to take look at the 70th floor...

About a hundred people were huddled together in a hilly area.

At first, they seemed a little confused, but now, after a day, they had calmed down. They appeared to have set up tents at the top of the hill where they would get a good view. They had sent some people to scout each area.

There was no sign of any immediate movement, and they were very cautious. This calm response was quite impressive, even though their commander had been sent to a different location alone.

They were the bravest among the members of each unit, I would say. I had thought they would be more flustered.

"No, this is just how it's supposed to be. The chain of command should always be clear so that we can be prepared in the event of the loss of the commander."

Unlike me, Benimaru was giving his assessment without holding back.

It was impossible to conduct operations if the chain of command was disjointed. There always had to be someone in charge.

I understood that it was only natural to have a clearly defined command structure, but the people gathered here must have been a collection of people. I secretly admired them despite the fact that we were enemies.

"Are we all set?"

"Of course we are. Even if I'm not there, Gobua will be, and there are excellent subordinates under Gobua. Tactical theory is a required course in the Kurenai, so anyone is able to be a commander if necessary."

My goodness, such confidence.

I hadn't even studied such a thing either, but when did he learn it?

"That's good then. Even so, they're not moving. What do you think they're after?"

I left the chain of command to Benimaru and the corps commanders. Since I couldn't be bothered, I decided to bring things back to reality.

The Imperial Guard was encamped at the 70th floor.

"As for their purpose, I think they are checking to see if there are any survivors on the other floors. In that sense, they are unlucky. There are no traces left on the other floors, but it's not the same here." Benimaru replied in a tone of pity for his enemies.

Upon hearing that, I agreed with him. I knew that there weren't any survivors of the Imperial Guard, but one of their goals was still to find their comrades. Joining up with the survivors and building up their strength made sense as a strategy. But because we knew it was pointless, it was no fun just waiting for them to make a move.

"Should we let Adalmann attack?" I muttered, and Shion nodded her head. She seemed to be quite bored and wanted to make a move. Still, as long as there were forces left in the labyrinth, she had a role to play in protecting me. Even Shion understood this and wanted to get this over with quickly and go out to fight.

"That's right. I don't think we'll get much information if we wait any longer."

Benimaru looked at Shion and spoke with a wry smile.

Then, the instructions to Adalmann were sent out.

"My god, watch me in action!"

It seems that Shion was not the only one who was looking forward to the battle. Adalmann was also preparing his army to attack the imperial army.

Adalmann and his men had been winning battle after battle. They seemed to be planning to continue their momentum and win the last battle.

"Well then, good luck!"

"Hahaha yes...!"

My encouragement was the signal to start. Adalmann and the others opened the closed gates with great vigor and set off.

Then an hour passed.

There was a startling scene. Only three of the Imperial Army survived. However, the survivors left on our side were Adalmann, Albert, and the death dragon.

It was now three against three.

Nearly a hundred others had been killed by the dead spirit army, so they had no reinforcements. I had thought that the dead spirit's army would revive in three hours, and the victory would be decided at that time.

But then...

"Kufufufufu, there are some interesting people who have emerged."

"Mm. They fight very well; I'd like to fight against them myself."

Diablo and Shion were unusually forthcoming.

Such powerful warriors were mixed in with the enemy. Three of them, in fact.

One of them was a handsome swordsman. He was fighting a close battle with Albert.

Another was a beautiful wizard. She was fighting with Adalmann in a magical battle.

The last was a large warrior. He was holding off the death dragon by himself.

He must have been like one of the legendary-grade wizards killed by Testarossa, judging from the familiar shining armor he summoned and wore.

They must all belong to the same organization, because of their uniform design.

"That swordsman, he's a fearsome individual. He's as good as Albert."

The fight between Albert and the man was an exchange of divine arts rarely seen. Both were sword and shield fighters of the same school, and their abilities were equal.

As Benimaru had said, they were evenly matched.

He seemed to be stronger than the man Testarossa had defeated. Perhaps, I thought, he might be even higher in the pecking order.

"Kufufufufu, Adalmann doesn't have quite enough faith yet either. The enemy is not going to fall behind someone even with that caliber of magic."

"I would say so, Diablo. That armor protects him from all kinds of magic, holy or demonic. Adalmann will be at a disadvantage."

Shion's opinion was appropriate. Adalmann had the Extra Skill 'Holy-Demonic Reversal', but that legendary-grade armor was a foul. In terms of anti-magic, it was almost completely resistant.

The only way to break it was to use the strongest magic like "Disintegration". Even Adalmann could use it, but his opponent would not allow him to do so.

The only way is to create an opening with a small magic, and then take aim. However, the current situation was that both parties seemed to be thinking the same thing, and they were competing against each other.

And we could not forget the last man.

He was also tricky. After all, he was the only one who was fighting against the death dragon. In his case, he had abandoned the idea of victory. He knew that it was impossible to defeat the death dragon because of its tremendous regenerative power.

He continued to fight a simple battle, believing in the victory of his comrades. In fact, if he had not done his best to do so, the game would have ended long ago.

The death dragon was a monster that even Souei could not defeat. Fighting well against it was more troublesome than expected.

"What do you think will happen?" I asked, and I got three different answers.

"Albert is the better fighter. But he is not as well equipped, so he will lose the battle."

"Adalmann is in too much of a hurry. If he had handled the battle calmly, he would have won by now, but as it is, he is not decisive. If Albert loses in the meantime, the battle will end in defeat."

"There can only be victory! There is no such thing as defeat!"

The three of them were very different---or perhaps Shion was the only one who is wrong?

Benimaru and Diablo had similar opinions. They seemed to think that Adalmann and his team would lose. Shion, on the other hand...thought that fighting spirit would conquer all. It wasn't really an opinion but a wish.

"So, they might lose, huh? Is that bad?"

"Well, even if Adalmann and his team lose, there are the other Elite Ten. Besides, I won't lose if I'm on the field, so it should be fine."

"Of course! I can beat them all too, so don't worry, Rimuru-sama!"

Benimaru was very confident, and Shion was the same as usual. I wanted to ask the reason for her words, but I guess there was no need for an answer. I would just accept her spirit, since it was just Shion's style.

"Rimuru-sama, there is nothing to worry about. The Elite Ten has Veldora-sama's disciple, Zegion. As long as he's around, I'm sure even Veldora-sama won't be bothered." Diablo replied with a "kufufufu" laugh.

It was rare for Diablo to praise others. I was a little relieved to hear that.

As we were talking like this, the battle seemed to be reaching its climax.

Adalmann's team would have won over time. There was such a hope, but unfortunately, the enemy seemed to have realized it as well.

"I was thinking of pushing through, but I guess that's not going to happen. You can be proud in the afterlife that you made me serious!" The man facing Albert shouted. I wondered if he still had some tricks up his sleeve.

"Before you die, allow me to tell you my name. My name is Krishna...Number 17 of the Imperial Guardians!"

"I am Number 94, Reicha."

"Number 35, Bazin."

Oh, just as I thought, it was the Imperial Guardians.

I had heard about them from Gadra, but it seems that they really did have a great lineup. The guy that Testarossa defeated was ranked 11th, so I guess Krishna and the others were better than him. I had thought that the number was in proportion to the strength, but it seemed not to be the case.

Reicha seemed to be better than Bazin, so I guess I was right.

In any case, the battle was a toss-up.

It looked like Adalmann's group had been reenergized by Krishna's words. I thought that this would help them to recover, but unfortunately, it did not.

The decisive battle was Krishna vs. Albert.

Krishna's sword broke through Albert's cursed sword.

It was not so much that Krishna broke it, but that he shattered it. This was completely due to the difference in weapon performance. Even the Curse Sword was an excellent sword made by Kurobee. It was the best weapon for Albert, though ordinary people could not handle it.

However, Krishna's sword was legendary-grade.

![break]

By repeating sword fights, he accumulated damage to his opponent's weapon little by little, and finally shattered it all at once. This appeared to be Krishna's specialty.

It was a good thing for him that this turned out to be the case.

With the loss of his weapon, Albert was defeated. Once the vanguard was gone, Adalmann was at a disadvantage. He was surprisingly persistent with his brilliant gestures, not unlike a rear-guard, but he was pushed to the limit and defeated.

Finally, the death dragon was extinguished by a simultaneous attack by the three of them, and the battle was over.

If Albert's sword had not been broken, the battle would have ended differently. Besides, I was not going to ask for the responsibility of the defeat, because it was absurd to ask a magician to compete with a warrior in the physical arts. Rather, I wanted to praise them for their good work in revealing the enemy's tricks.

In the end, the battle turned out as Benimaru and Diablo had predicted. They lost two keys, but that was inevitable. I would give them credit for fighting the good fight.

Thus, we suffered a bitter defeat against Krishna and his three friends.

![break]

Well, we would reflect on what was to be done later.

It was time to move on.

On the big screen, we could see the battle scenes at the 79th floor and the battle scene at the 90th floor.

In both cases, the battle seemed to be reaching their climax.

The most extreme one was Kumara, because she had said that the bearded man was her target of vengeance.

On the other hand, Apito's was not so extreme. It was a surprisingly close battle.

Apito was as strong as Hinata without magic. This commander-like man was also a very strong fighter against Apito. This guy also happened to be dressed quite handsomely, but he seemed to be as good as Krishna.

Now then, it was time to see how the battles would turn out.

I held my breath and kept my eyes glued to the big screen.

![hard scene break]

Major General Minits was dressed in his signature suit and walked through the labyrinth with ease. The suit design was the same as that of a typical officer's suit, but the fabric was different. Every thread had been carefully selected and mana had been kneaded into the fabric.

This was a luxury item that was equivalent to the annual salary of a colonel, promising to be comfortable enough to satisfy even the most fashionable Minits.

Elegance was what Minits was all about. As such, Minits was not happy about this operation.

In war, one should aim for a victory without fighting by overwhelming the enemy with overwhelming force. Sacrificing lives was out of the question, and when it was happening in their own army, it was no wonder that the commander's ability was questioned. Because of this, Minits had declared that this operation was a failure even before the result.

However...he was not so sure about the results of the operation.

"Well, I guess it's the sadness of being in the palace service as an official that I can't say such an obvious fact." Minits smiled wryly while he complained.

Although he was not usually the center of attention because Kansas, his subordinate, always stood out, Minits himself was one of the bravest men in the Imperial Army. He did not have a soft heart to give up a war in the middle of a battle because it went against his aesthetics.

"But then again, Demon Lord Rimuru is quite the cruel man. It's a natural course of action, but to send me, the commander, to a completely different place... This way, the brave men who gathered this time might all be defeated by a small number. Well, at least Kansas-kun seems to have survived..."

Minits talked to himself, as if he did not care who heard. Despite the content of his words, he seemed to be enjoying himself. It was no wonder that Minits was elated for the first time in a long time. He had never been exposed to such a dangerous situation since he was born. He was in a position where he himself was rarely allowed to even be in the front line.

Minits was not a maverick, but rather an upper-class individual from an aristocratic family. In fact, he was even more higher-ranked than Calgurio when outside of the military. He was well-connected in the political world and had established his own faction.

The reason why Minits still belonged to the military was because he loved fighting. Minits loved the sight of blood. And now that he had this opportunity, he could go on a rampage to his heart's content. The thought of it made Minits's cheeks loosen.

Minits had been sent to the seventy-eighth floor, one floor above the floor ruled by Apito. The reason for this was to see how Minits fared before analyzing his abilities.

So Minits went to the lower floors, kicking away insects as if he were walking in an uninhabited field.

"Oh dear, I don't like bugs. Just seeing their legs wriggle makes me feel sickened. I've got to get out of this place as soon as possible."

With a single, arrogant wave of his hand, Minits swung his hand to the side. With that, a gust of wind blew, and the numerous insects were broken up into dust.

This was the power of Minits.

It was his Unique Skill 'Oppressor'.

This power was simple and clear. From psychological oppression to physical compression, it affected everything in Minits's field of vision. There was no way to escape from it, and everything would disappear in a cloud of dust.

In fact, an object could be destroyed with just a glance, without even the need to wave an arm. Minits had been undefeated until now, thanks to this power.

"How brittle. They're too boring and unresponsive. I wish they would try harder."

No one could stop Minits now. A swarm of bugs of Over A rank appeared on the seventy-eighth floor, but all of them were killed by Minits. They were no match for him, and the battle was won in an instant.

He seemed truly invincible. The arrogance of Minits was understandable with this power.

Minits discovers the staircase in a few hours. Going at his own pace as always, he began to take a rest, as if he was simply going camping.

The leather bag on his waist was a high-end magic travel bag. From it, he pulled out a freshly prepared meal to enjoy. The bag even contained a set of bedding with a roof over it to ward off evil spirits, and later Minits went to sleep without a care in the world.

Minits even slept without a care in the world.

Then came the next day.

Minits stepped into the seventy-ninth floor with ease, and there he met his true enemy.

The Silent Killer Wasps---these were the Army Wasps that had attacked Minits, and Minits was the first one to get a glimpse of their abilities. No matter how nasty the monster was, the battle was decided as soon as they entered his sight.

"Well, these monsters here are no match for me either. How disappointing!"

Seeing Minits talking so boldly, one of them became furious.

It was Apito.

Minits showed that he could handle any angle of sneaking up on him. It was obvious that Minits had mastered 'Magic Perception'. If that was the case, it was pointless to force the Army Wasps any further. So, the queen herself came to the front.

"Humans, how dare you say such a thing!"

"Is that so? You're a bit too pushy, aren't you? To me, I don't see much of a difference between you and these insects..."

At those words, Minits trampled the carcasses of the dead wasps on the ground. This action made Apito's anger flare up even more fiercely.

"I'm going to kill you."

"Just try it!"

Thus, the two heroes clashed fiercely.

At first, Minits thought very little of Apito.

Not that he was careless, but he thought that his own 'Oppressor' would break Apito into pieces. However, he soon realized that he was being naive.

An interference wave was emitted on the line of sight, and Apito became pressured heavily. It was an invisible force of attraction. Minits was able to influence the surrounding matter and give direction to the pulling force.

The gravitational pull of a massive star was used to repel matter in all directions. By successfully manipulating the tensile and repulsive forces, Minits was able to explode or compress objects.

The only way to resist this force was to have a strong body that was not easily moved, or to release a directional wave that canceled out the interference waves.

Minits had never met anyone who could do such a thing. In other words, Minits felt invincible. With such absolute confidence, Minits activated his ability. However, the scene that appeared was different from what Minits had expected.

"Too slow!"

Minits had only shattered an afterimage of Apito. Apito had not discovered the true nature of Minits's power, but she had noticed that it was directional. She guessed that she could escape from the area of effect if she moved quickly enough, and she showed a remarkable evasion.

"Fufufu, I was right. Do you think you can catch my movements?" Apito's movements accelerated.

No matter how hard Minits tried to use his 'Magic Perception', it was difficult for him to make an effective attack on Apito.

Minits, however, was inspired.

"Interesting. If this wasn't the case, the battle would be too boring!"

He unleashed his abilities to the fullest and formed a force field around himself. At the same time, he stepped forward to block Apito's path.

Apito had no choice but to fall back. The passage of the labyrinth is five meters wide, but if she tried to slip through beside Minits, she would be trapped by the force field.

"Damn, that's nasty."

"That's what I'm talking about!"

Neither side gave an inch.

Apito's movements had become even more refined and sharp with her training with Hinata. Apito was able to spar against even the leader of Holy Knights, but it was meaningless if she could not get close to him.

It was also dangerous to stop herself from moving. If Apito was caught by the interference wave, she would not be safe.

*It was a bad idea to come out here. If I retreat to the queen's room, I would be able to fly around more freely. I don't know how long this man's power will last, but the only way to find a chance is to go back.*

Apito decided as such. There was no shame in running away. A greedy pursuit for victory was Apito's basic policy.

Minits did not make fun of Apito when she ran away. He saw it as a strategic retreat and, on the contrary, pursued her cautiously.

There was no need to hurry. Rather than pushing too hard at this point, he prioritized to conserve his strength.

*Fighting must be done gracefully. But it is better to struggle in vain than to lose.*

Minits found Apito beautiful.

Unlike the other monsters, he saw Apito as an opponent with aesthetics.

It was natural for a warrior to choose the battlefield that was favorable to them. Minits did not laugh at this, but rather, appreciated the fact that they were doing their best to fight against him.

Minits chased after Apito, not underestimating his opponent, but thinking of how to corner her.

He arrived at a large open space.

There was a chair on a higher platform.

*Apparently, this is the throne where the queen reigns. Fine. It's a good place for you and me to settle our scores.*

'I dared to accept the enemy's invitation. So let me enjoy myself,' Minits thought arrogantly.

"Are we done playing tag?"

"Yes. I shall do my best to entertain you. I am the Insect Queen, my name is Apito."

"That's exciting. I am the one who will kill you, Major General Minits-kun. Let's move on to the second round!"

With that, Minits accelerated.

This was only a wait-and-see move, but it was the real deal. The speed was not faster than Apito's, but not so fast that he would fall behind.

However, Apito was not fazed by this. Rising high into the sky, Apito sped up in an attempt to play a trick on Minits.

But this was within Minits's expectations.

"How naive. Don't underestimate my power!" he shouted after he had unleashed his power.

An invisible force field was generated near the ceiling of the domed hall, which caught Apito. Minits has manipulated the force of attraction and attached Apito to the ceiling.

"G-GHHHH!"

Minits sneered at the suffering Apito.

"Hmmm, are you in pain? I'd like to crush you right away, but you are a little too strong. I could've crushed any ordinary monster at this distance," he said, stepping closer to her.

Minits's power was proportional to the distance. His action was based on the idea that the closer he got, the more pressure he would exert on Apito, and thus, he could crush and kill even a big opponent like Apito.

Moreover, now that Apito had been captured, there was no need for Minits to exert his power in all directions. By concentrating his power only on Apito, he would be able to achieve a sure victory.

*It was a harder fight than I expected, but I guess she is my enemy after all. However, as a reward for entertaining me this far, I will bury her without making her suffer.*

Minits had no taste for antagonizing his enemies. He only wanted the elation of battle and the thrill of victory.

That is why he tried to show mercy to Apito out of pure goodwill.

"Don't you dare underestimate me, human! I said I was going to give my all!"

With a cry, Apito, who had been suffering under the pressure, flew into the air once again. Even with her wings torn, limbs bent, and wounds all over her body, Apito's will to fight remained undimmed. Apito was also greedily pursuing victory.

"Rimuru-sama is watching this battle, too. It's my job to reveal the enemy's hand, no matter how bad things may get!"

"Kukukuku, interesting. You think you can see through my power? I'll let you die first!"

Minits once again generated a force field centered on himself. Repulsion and attraction, repelling those who try to approach him, and at the same time manipulating the flow of force to sew them to the ground. Minits set out to finish Apito off.

Apito, on the other hand, did not stay down forever. She flew faster than Minits's visual perception and kept her distance in order to avoid being caught by the interference wave.

It was a pity that Apito had no means of attack, but her opponent's power was not inexhaustible. There must be a limit at some point, and Apito continued to wait for that moment.

Would Minits's limit come first, or would Apito run out of power first?

Thus, a battle of endurance began.

![break]

It was only after a few hours had passed that the situation began to change.

Apito followed Hinata's teachings and continued to try every possible means of attack.

Her broken limbs were gone, and she continued to fly around desperately with her torn wings, looking for an opening in Minits. She sent poisonous needles flying at his blind spots and vibrated her wings to release shock blades. She called all the Army Wasps under her command to attack Minits from all directions. All of these actions were aimed at finding the point where Minits's interference power would be weakened.

By these actions, the Army Wasp were completely wiped out. Even her own subordinates were called by Apito. It was impossible not to be frustrated. Even so, Apito let her men continue their suicide attack.

As a result, Minits was far from unharmed.

The expensive suit he used to wear was now in tatters. His elegance had been abandoned, and desperate evasive maneuvers could be seen.

"Fufufufu. You look tired."

"...You, too. I'm honestly surprised that you've stuck with it this long."

"I told you, didn't I? It doesn't matter how bad things get, as long as I win."

"I agree. But I'm the one who will win!"

Both of them had great patience for showing a smile.

They were so exhausted that they could barely stand. In spite of such a situation, they showed off their strength to each other.

"Your strength is great. I admit it, but you are far from perfect. I declare that I will kill you with my next attack!"

These were the words of Apito, floating in the air, to Minits. Her face was covered in her own blood, but she had a beautiful, radiant smile on her face.

Minits looks at her with narrowed eyes and replied with the corners of his mouth turned up.

"I'm looking forward to it. Then, I promise to make your life easier with my next blow."

Both opponents had little strength left in them. They declared that they would decide the match with the next blow because that was all they had left.

Both of them began to move with all their strength, without thinking of what would come next.

Apito predicted the movement of Minits's interference wave and changed her trajectory just before the attack. Apito was planning to exceed the reaction of Minits by hitting him with her body at a speed faster than the speed of sound.

Minits knew this, too. The question was to what extent that Apito knew his power. She would have to deal with the invisible interference waves depending on whether or not they were accurately detected when they were triggered.

Minits believed in himself that she wouldn't see them.

The battle was decided in that one moment.

At the moment Minits released his power, Apito changed her orbit. However, this was due to her own intuition, as Minits had expected, and she did not see the interference wave.

Minits laughed at his victory, and Apito laughed at her death.

![full page image](image8)

That's right. Apito's attack was, from the very beginning, predicated on her death.

"It's over, Queen Apito." Minits exclaimed happily.

Apito opened her mouth wide and tried to shoot out her trump card, just as she felt an invisible surge of power enveloping her entire body.

Queen of Needles---Apito bet her life and released her most powerful poison needle. It was not created by her spirit, but by a part of Apito's own body.

Its hardness easily penetrated even a magisteel. Apito was convinced that a poisoned needle, if fired at close range with all her power, would penetrate Minits' force field.

The Minits' power compressed on Apito, and the poison needle released by Apito penetrated his force field and came close him---the time of the showdown had come.

The result was that both Minits and Apito were defeated.

Apito was dissatisfied that she had not achieved a complete victory, but she was still happy to have done her part.

Death was not the end. In this labyrinth, one could be resurrected as many times as you wished.

Apito disappeared from the labyrinth, waiting for the time of resurrection.

Minits, upon seeing this, decided to rest quietly until his wounds healed.

Minits was still alive, though his heart was shattered by the current attack. Minits was not the kind of man that would die from such an attack, and the wound would heal with time.

Minits was filled with a sense of contentment at being able to surrender to an unprecedented battle.

*It was a great battle. I wish I could taste more, so I can prove that I am the best...*

Minits thought as such in the aftermath of the battle. He was bloodthirsty, but he was not satisfied just yet. Instead, Minits's instinct was telling him that he wanted to fight a stronger fighter.

Challenge and surpass your limits. Believing that by doing so, they would become stronger.

As if in response to Minits's desire, something unusual happened.

Another person's voice echoed out.

"---That was a great battle."

The voice exuded the air of a champion who reigned over others.

"My name is Zegion, and you are qualified to fight me. If you want it, come to me."

As if guided by his voice, Minits reopened his closed eyes.

Ahead of his line of sight, he could see the dark vortex that had appeared before he even realized it.

*Are you going to entertain me? In that case, I must accept your invitation...*

Undeterred by his unhealed body, Minits stood up. And then...

Undaunted, Minits set off to go where he was invited.

![hard scene break]

There was once a hidden village called "youma village (beast village)."

It was said to be one of the most unexplored places in the world and was a paradise of everlasting spring.

It no longer existed.

It was overrun by the imperial army twenty years ago and had vanished from the world.

![break]

Kumara recalled that day and was almost overcome with rage. She had lost her mother and her friends because she had been powerless.

Her great mother was a youma, as powerful as a demon lord. But she was a gentle youma, who would never have been hostile to human beings.

Indeed, the king of demons who was hostile to humans calls himself "Phantom King". They were of a different power from the ten demon lords, and they were a threat to mankind.

But this had nothing to do with youma village.

Demons were demons. Youma were youma, and the Phantom King was just a king of a tribe whose race was not even known.

However, the existence of Kumara and her friends must have been unforgivable to the human race, or rather, to the empire. Youma village was used as a demonstration sacrifice to show the might of the nation to the subjects of the empire.

The location of the "youma township" was along the border between Demon Lord Clayman's territory and the eastern empire. The entrance to the other world was hidden between the foot of the mountain on the Jistav side and the forest on the Imperial side.

The blessings of the forests, the delicacies of the mountains, and a mild climate. It was not a paradise of everlasting spring, but a very comfortable place to live.

They had also been careless because they were along the border and could not be attacked. Demon Lord Clayman and the Empire had signed a secret non-aggression pact.

This peaceful situation had paralyzed their sense of crisis.

Suddenly, armed soldiers attacked the "youma township" without any sign of them. And in spite of the resistance of the warriors who were defending the village, all of their comrades were killed.

Her mother, the previous nine heads, also lost her life at that time.

She was powerful, but she hated fighting. Even though the opponent was human, she could not win against a professional soldier who specialized in fighting.

And then there was the man she would never forget.

"He's called Kansas, I remember. The name of the man who was my mother's, and everyone's killer---" Kumara shouted in a vindictive tone.

That bearded man with the nasty smile was an enemy whom Kumara could not be satisfied with even by killing.

As a reward to Clayman, Kansas had offered Kumara, a nine-head child, which he had captured alive. And then he put all the treasures in the village into their own pockets.

He had told his subjects that the threat of "youma village" had passed.

That threat was a criminal act of their own making. In order to let the people know that "youma village" was dangerous, they had selected some of the residents and merchants in the neighborhood, and cruelly killed them off.

Those frightened subjects treated them as if they were champions...

It was Clayman, of all people, who had told her this backstory.

The more Kumara's resentment was directed towards humans, the stronger she became as youma, and her "status" as a monster would increase.

Because Kumara was a valuable "nine-headed" youma beast, Clayman considered her to be an asset. Thanks to this, she was able to survive as a pet.

Kumara had accumulated resentment and increased her power, just as Clayman had predicted. Kumara was chosen as one of the five fingers of Clayman's army, the thumb finger.

Fate had taken a further turn, and Kumara was picked up by Rimuru.

It was there that she remembered what happiness was, and her emotional wounds were healed through contact with the children...and it was then that she met her bitter enemy once again.

"I'll kill you. I will tear you apart with all my might." Kumara muttered and waited for Kansas to come.

![break]

On the other hand, there was Colonel Kansas.

He did not show any sign of being affected even though he was sent to an unknown place all alone.

Kansas was a hard-working soldier. He was the epitome of the meritocracy of the empire and had risen to his current position with just his fists.

He was a man of careerism, with no regard for any wrongdoings.

He considered the "youma village" incident as a legitimate act to strengthen his position and power.

For the sake of great peace, a few sacrifices were insignificant. He did not even feel guilty about his actions, believing them to be a necessary evil.

However, despite the problems of his human nature, there was no doubt about his ability.

If he had participated in the battle for the top rank, he would have been selected as one of the top hundred. The reason why this had not happened was that Kansas was not interested in joining the Imperial Guardians.

He was putting his own interests above the loyalty to Emperor Rudra. Above all, Kansas had a superior whom he trusted with all his heart.

That superior was Major General Minits.

He was not only equal to Kansas in terms of ability, but he was also the man who had taken an interest in Kansas and helped to pull him up.

It was Kansas' goal in life to bring Minits to the top of the army and to take full power under him, and he had been working hard and dreaming of that day ever since.

That was why he saw this invasion as a great opportunity.

Calgurio's failure was obvious to all, and he would be punished for it. Rather, he had to work together with Minits to unify the Armored Corps.

By rescuing the soldiers left behind in the labyrinth and selling them favors, he would be able to quickly increase the numbers in a new faction.

Then, Calgurio would no longer bee needed.

"Fufu, how ridiculous. How can he be so naive as to think that political power alone will allow him to become the head of the army?"

Kansas ridiculed his superiors as much as he liked because no one was listening. Then, he calmly walked away to search for his surviving subordinates.

After a day had passed, Kansas began to think that something was wrong.

Putting aside the fact that there were forests and deserts in the labyrinth, not a soul was to be seen. On the contrary, not even a monster was to be found.

Every floor of the labyrinth was eerily quiet, and nothing was happening, making him feel foolish for being so vigilant.

Of course, Kansas was not the kind of person to be caught off guard by such things, but the fact that his 'danger detector' did not respond at all made him feel more anxious.

"Hmmm. I guess they don't want to catch me off guard. If that's the case, are they concentrating their forces?"

Kansas' insight was fearsome. He was right.

"Hahaha, I'm so glad to hear that they are giving me such a welcome! Well then, I'll feel free to visit!"

That boldness of Kansas was one of his virtues. He decided that he could kick out any traps and began sprinting toward the lower floors at once.

At a speed that left the wind behind him, Kansas ran. With a single kick to the ground, he traveled several meters and reached the stairs in a blink of an eye.

A few hours later...

The gates of a vast mansion stood before Kansas' eyes.

It was an opulent structure that could intimidate its visitors.

Then, without a sound, the gate opened, and the battle began.

![soft scene break]

Kumara greets the guest with a ghastly smile on her beautiful face that would make one's hair stand on end.

"Welcome, welcome."

Kansas responded with a smile.

"Well, well, well. It's a familiar face. Are you the little fox from back then?"

"You remember me? That's a great honor."

"How could I forget?---Your mother helped me to get ahead."

Sparks flew between them.

It was no hallucination. It was a physical phenomenon caused by the violent clash between the haki and fighting aura.

"I can't believe you're saying that so easily!"

"Hahaha! I'm glad you're all right. But you survived only because I sold you to Clayman. You should thank me for that."

"I'll kill you." Kumara howled with an even greater fury.

In response, the white monkey Byakuren emerged. As if to show his dignity as the leader of the eight, he launched a series of club attacks on Kansas.

"A survivor of youma? Then I, too, will show you something interesting."

As soon as he said this, Kansas summoned a monster without any preliminary movement.

It was a monkey covered with black fur.

"You---you're my mother's servant!"

That's right.

It was definitely one of Kumara's mother's tailed beasts.

"Well, don't you miss it? Play with him."

The dark monkey was also a gentle magic beast. Kumara remembered playing with him. And yet...

The dark monkey with whom she had such fond memories...had a vicious look on his face...and he was baring his fangs.

"Have you forgotten me?"

Kumara's voice didn't reach him. The dark monkey screamed "Keeeee!" and overwhelmed Byakuren.

"It's no use! That monkey has become my loyal servant. He doesn't remember anything about you."

Not taking part in the fight, Kansas pulled a cigarette from his pocket and put it in his mouth. He lit it, inhaled the smoke, and smiled at Kumara.

"What did you do to the Dark Monkey, you son of a bitch?"

"Oh? What did I do to the dark monkey? Do you suspect me of something?"

The reply was like a mockery to Kumara.

Realizing that Kansas was not going to answer seriously, Kumara made her next move in anger.

"Moon rabbit Gett, black rat Kokuso, come out!"

Kumara's tail turned into magic beasts.

It was now three against one. The Kumara side had the upper hand once again.

But that was only for a moment.

"Come out, dark rabbit, and dark rat!"

To the surprise of everyone, Kansas even summoned magic beasts in time with Kumara.

Kumara could not hide her surprise.

"H-How..."

"Are you surprised? But so am I. I didn't think you would be able to summon three tailed beasts when you are just a kid. Clayman seems to have trained you well."

He was confident in his attitude, but there is a reason for it. The magic beasts summoned by Kansas were stronger than the eight under Kumara.

"How troublesome. Let's end the fun now." As soon as he said so, Kansas added more magic beasts.

"No way! A dark tiger and a dark snake!"

Comparing the strength of each of these magic beasts, Kansas' magic beasts were stronger. And that's as it should be. These magic beasts were the faithful guardians of the previous nine-heads who belonged to Kumara's mothers.

Five such powerful magic beasts. They had lost their gentle and calm temperament from those days, and were now standing in front of her, unleashing their ferocious instincts.

Kansas thought that he had won at this point. No matter how much Kumara, a young fox cub, had grown up, she could only control three tailed beasts at most.

Even Kumara's mother could only produce five tailed beasts. He had thought that Kumara, who had lived only a few hundred years, would never be able to produce such power, even if she became a fox who had lived for thousands of years.

That's why Kansas spoke to her arrogantly.

"I'd be happy to keep you as my lapdog if that's what you are now. You can switch over from Demon Lord Rimuru to me. I'll spare your life."

His tone of voice was more like an order than a negotiation. It was a statement based on the certainty of his victory. But Kansas was fatally mistaken.

Kumara became furious. Her smile became deeper and more beautiful.

"You're a funny guy. You must have prepared to make me so angry, didn't you?" She asked, but no answer was needed.

Kumara unleashed her tailed beasts---all eight of them. Those that appeared were thunder tiger Raikou, winged snake Yoda, sleeping sheep Mink, flame bird Enchou, and mirror dog Igami.

"How is that possible? Eight of them? You..."

This was the first time Kansas showed agitation, but it was only for a moment. He immediately regained his composure and smiled wryly.

"I commend you that you have grown so much to the point that you surprised me. But I still have the advantage."

"Shut up!"

"How terrible. In that case, I'll say no more. I'll rip off your hands and feet and hang them in my room."

The negotiations were over. And so began the battle of eight against five.

![break]

The eight were more advantageous in terms of numbers, but the opponents were elites who had served their predecessors for a long time. The amount of magicules they had accumulated was different. Above all, their experience is different.

Byakuren was not weak by any means, but the dark magic beasts were so strong that they overturned the numerical disadvantage.

As time passed, the Eight beasts began to be pushed back. But Kumara still did not give up.

Observing Kansas, she noticed one thing. The magic beasts summoned by Kansas were individually very powerful. Moreover, they seem to have lost their memories completely, but they also seemed to have retained their rationality. They responded quickly to Kansas's instructions and dealt with the eight beasts.

Conversely, this meant that Kumara had a chance to win if she could defeat Kansas, the leader. Besides, Kumara still had another trick up her sleeve. All she has to do was recall the eight members back to her and become her true self.

Kumara judged that if she did so, she would be superior to Kansas. Kumara, therefore, analyzed the war situation without hesitation.

And what about Kansas? He looked as if things were going fine, but he was actually on the edge of his limits. There was a reason why Kansas was leading the dark magic beasts. Kansas's power was the secret.

Unique Skill 'Marauder'---that was the power that Kansas possessed. This power was meaningless by itself. It was a power that had no effect. Kansas first became aware of this power when he was a child. He killed a dog owned by a friend of his in revenge for a quarrel over a trivial matter. Then, he was able to summon a dark dog.

This alone was only a little useful in battle, but the real value of this power lay elsewhere. This was revealed when Kansas joined the army and defeated the guerrillas on the frontier. He was able to summon a "darkness" that was as powerful as the ones he had killed.

Then Kansas realized. He could only summon the darkness from those he had killed. This meant that the more he killed, the stronger he would become. Skill and the shape of the person he killed could be reproduced perfectly. It was a very versatile Skill, useful for disguising oneself in an undercover mission. But there was a limit. His power did not add up all of the power of those he killed, but was only up to the power of the strongest opponent he had killed. If that were possible, it would mean that Kansas could control an army by himself. There was no such universalism, and there was a limit to the value of Kansas' existence.

Kumara saw through it correctly. Therefore, there was no need to panic even if the current situation was unfavorable.

"I understand. You have reached your limit, haven't you?"

"Then so what?"

"I don't know how you're controlling those dark beats, but it doesn't matter. Because all I have to do is kill you."

This was Kumara's analysis of the war situation.

Although the forces of the subordinates were in competition, the commanders of both sides were not participating in the battle. If Kumara took out Kansas, he would not be able to give orders to the magical beasts of darkness. And if Kumara and Kansas were to be compared, Kumara was far superior in the amount of magicules.

"Don't worry. Your death will not be easy."

As soon as she announced this, Kumara vanished from the scene and took Kansas' back in an instant. She then tried to slit his neck with her outstretched claws.

Kansas responded with a show. He admitted that Kumara was right, but still maintained a relaxed attitude.

"That's scary. If I had known you would grow up to be this big, I should have killed you at that time."

"Shut up!"

"Kukuku, don't be so angry. I'll show you something funny in return for your apology." Saying so, Kansas laughed.

Indeed, Kansas's 'Marauder' only had the power to summon those he had killed. There was a limit to how many he could summon, and the power that Kansas himself had gained was only as strong as the strongest person he had ever defeated. However, Kansas was hiding a secret trick. Without hesitation, he decided to disclose it.

"Why do you think I sold you to Clayman? Why do you think I gave you up even though I knew you would be a great asset? It was because..."

He had more power than Kumara, and he could have easily tamed and nurtured Kumara.

Kansas obliterated the magic beasts of darkness and summoned a single giant beast to take their place. This was the source of Kansas' power and the reason he did not need Kumara.

"Th-that, it looks like...Mother?"

A dark fox appeared. It had five thick tails and four thin ones. With a total of nine tales, it was the mistress of the "youma village". However, her appearance had become a disaster, and there was no trace of the kindly face she had when she was alive.

"Haaaaaahaha! That's right. This is your mother. But by being manipulated by me, she's learned to wield her maniacal power to the fullest. It's wonderful. Wouldn't you like to see it?"

Her gentle nature became a curse, and she showed mercy to her enemies. Therefore, even though she was as powerful as a demon lord, she had lived a modest life, hiding and hiding, minimizing her interactions with the world.

Such was the case with the previous generation. Now, through the hands of Kansas, her true power was unleashed.

"Do you even mock the dead?"

"No, I'm not. It's respect. I'm trying to put it to good use, and I want you to thank me for it."

The dark nine-head that Kansas summoned flares up at the sight of Kumara. There was no emotion in her eyes. She only took one look at Kumara with the eyes of an enemy.

"Mother..."

"Kill her."

Following an order, the nine heads moved. The next moment, the dark tailed beasts united in a single all-out blow, cleaving the eight heads in half.

"Yoda, Igami---?"

The two that were too late to move were seriously wounded by the blow and returned to Kumara's tail. That's how powerful it was. It was obvious that the eight beasts had no chance.

"Hahaha! Isn't this funny? This power is the reason I don't need you. But with all those tails, you're better than your mother. What you lack in experience, I make up for in experience. Kukuku, I'm glad I let you live. If I get ahold of you here too, then I'll have even more power!"

Kansas exulted. He had no intention of losing. He possessed the strongest nine heads, and an equally strengthened self. With such a strong force, there was no way he could be defeated by the little fox. Kansas is convinced of this.

Kansas considered even Clayman to be of a lower rank.

He had thought that he could defeat the new Demon Lord Rimuru only after he had mastered the power of the Nine Heads, which was comparable to that of the Demon Lords. He inwardly taunted Clayman thinking that it wasn't such a big deal.

However, Kumara in front of him showed that she could use as many as eight tailed beasts. Though their individual strength was not so great that they had only lost due to their inexperience. It was hard to imagine what they would become when they grew up.

*I'm so lucky. I'll kill her here and dye her corpse with my power!*

This would greatly increase the power of Kansas. A new demon lord could do nothing in the face of that power.

Thinking of this, Kansas began to attack Kumara.

![break]

Kumara, who had been standing still, shook her head and muttered to herself.

"If I lose my cool, I will lose. I forgot Hinata-sama's lesson, didn't I?"

Then she caught the man and the beast slowly approaching in her eyes.

"Everyone, come back!"

In response to her words, the tailed beasts were sucked into Kumara's tail as light. Kumara's nine tails began to glow with a dazzling radiance.

The man and the beasts were now in front of her.

But Kumara does not panic.

She was inexperienced with tailed beasts. She could admit it.

But Kumara herself was not.

She had a good teacher and a group of friends. A wonderful environment. All of them had helped Kumara to improve.

Kumara gently clenched the sharp claws of her right and left hands.

"...!"

"You?!"

"I haven't told you my name yet. My name is Kumara."

"What, your name---?!"

"I am the "nine head" Kumara."

Claws clenched and the sound of shattering knives rang out.

As Kansas hurriedly moved away, Kumara smiled at him.

"You don't need to remember. I was going to give you a slow and horrible death, but that was too much for me. Therefore---"

No sooner had she finished her words had the dark beast become shattered into pieces. The previous nine heads was torn to pieces by Kumara's hands.

"Nonsense!" Kansas exclaimed involuntarily at this shocking event.

The strongest piece in his hand for the battle was now vanishing right before his eyes.

Unlike in a summoning, Kansas's 'Marauder' only formed "darkness" based on the corpse. Therefore, a vanished individual could not be recalled again.

Kumara had now regained her stolen mother.

"Y-you..."

"I could've made you suffer if I were stronger. It's a shame, but you're done here."

"W-wait---!"

She didn't listen to that kind of nonsense. Kansas's pleas fell on deaf ears.

"Farewell."

The end of those words was the end of Kansas's life.

The nine-tailed slash---slashes from all directions by the shining tails cut Kansas into tiny pieces and killed him without a moment's hesitation.

![full page image](image9)

This was Kumara. A woman of beauty and a ruthless will of steel.

She longed for what she had lost, but she had no regrets. She understands that death was death and was irrevocable. That is why it was important not to let anything be taken from her any longer.

Youma Village had been lost, but now Kumara had a new home to return to. Making sure that it was not taken away was the most important thing to Kumara now.

"I wanted to give you all a chance for revenge, but please forgive me."

Even so, vengeance had been taken. Her mother's life was not restored, but her dignity was. Kumara was satisfied with this and smiled whole-heartedly.

![hard scene break]

One man was meditating silently. Golden streaks ran through his jet-black exoskeleton. Shining like red jade was a single sword-like horn extending from the center of his forehead. Beneath that horn was a pair of crimson eyes that never closed. They took in information from the surroundings and continued to process it in the brains.

His exoskeleton had been modified according to the tastes of his master, Rimuru. Rimuru's cells and magisteel had reinforced his missing body parts.

He was now well accustomed to it and it had become a part of himself. He had developed an unparalleled property of what might be called adamantite, combining strength beyond that of a diamond with the flexibility of a living creature.

It was natural armor, equivalent to legendary-grade armor. But even so, his strength was not derived from his exoskeleton. The essence of his strength was derived from his instinct to fight greedily.

And now...

A new prey had come before him. Everything was as he wished. He was the absolute master of the labyrinth. The strongest guardian of the labyrinth...the Insect Kaiser Zegion.

And then...

Zegion thought to himself. There are those who were qualified to fight him. That's why he was calling them over. Making them come to this dark space. Those who had reached this floor were lucky. They could die with the dignity of a human being and the pride of a worthy opponent.

.........

......

...

At the end of the stairs leading to the 80th floor of the labyrinth, there was a room where one could rest. To show that there were no traps, the room was open with no door. At the end of the room, one could see a luxurious door. Beyond that door was the room for the boss of this floor.

It was exactly this room that Minits found at the end of the dark vortex.

The room was dimly lit, and there were fruits and drinks on the table. It was also furnished with utilitarian commodities and comfortable chairs.

There were already a few first-timers in the room. Minits looked at them lightly and tried to recall if he remembered any of them.

Before Minits, the people who had been sitting in the chairs talking with each other stood up.

"Major General Minits, are you all right? I belong to the 'Augmented Legion' 26th Division..."

"That's enough. This labyrinth is not a lukewarm place where a single soldier or low-ranking officer can survive. I fully understand that."

Minits held up one hand to hold his opponent's greeting. If they were senior officers or above, he remembered their names and affiliations. Minits, however, had no memory of those in front of him.

That meant only one thing...

In this labyrinth, even those of Over A rank would have had a hard time surviving. At least, against the majin of insects that Minits just defeated, there was no way they could survive even if they gathered their numbers.

Even among the superhumans who had broken through the wall, it was impossible for even a handful of them to take on a person of that class. Such a powerful person would not be content with such a lowly position, and that is why Minits had a guess as to the identity of those in front of him.

"Ha! You are correct, sir. I am Krishna, 17th rank in the Imperial Guardians."

"I am Bazin, Number 35."

"I'm Reicha, Number 94."

"Hmm. So, you are the knight escort of the emperor. You have been infiltrating our army as spies for the current operation."

"That's correct."

"I might have my doubts even if you answer so honestly, but that's all right for now. Let's talk about the future."

"We were discussing whether this would be a good idea."

"Mm-hmm."

As if taking it for granted that his prediction was correct, Minits proceeded with his story.

The fact that they were being watched was not funny, but the important thing was to survive. What was needed here was not rank or position, but strength. Therefore, Minits made a decision to give priority to a meaningful discussion, without questioning Krishna and the others' positions.

"So, what happened to all the others?"

"Yes. We were sent to the floor where the 'mighty king' was reported to be." Krishna replied on behalf of the three.

Minits urged them onward with a glance.

"We were facing the evil King of the Undead with only ninety-six men without commanders. In that battle, the rest of us..."

"It's unbelievable. They were all one-hundred-thousand warriors who could act on their own without orders. They may not have been as good as you, but they were the best of our army."

The mission was to rescue the imperial army. All of them, even the most junior soldiers, were A-ranked, for all possible contingencies.

Minits urged them on in a stern tone of voice, saying "I can't believe they were all wiped out."

"He was a fearsome monster. And the dead spirit knight who guarded him was also a top-notch swordsman."

"They killed everyone in that group except the three of us. I don't have an answer to the criticism that we should have revealed ourselves earlier. But a dead dragon, a dead sword saint, and the Immortal King. It's a miracle that we survived."

Bazin interrupted the conversation between Krishna and Minits. His words were full of anger, and he seemed to regret in disappointment. It was obvious to everyone that he meant what he said.

"You're being rude to the Major General, Bazin."

"But, Reicha-san..."

"No, I don't care. This labyrinth is dangerous. We can help each other here to survive, regardless of our status." Minits verbally offered to cooperate.

If the other party was the Emperor's guard, he had no complaints about his ability. This was no time for quarreling.

"We are encouraged by your offer."

Krishna was well aware of Major General Minits of the Armored Corps. It was no wonder that he belonged to the Emperor's Imperial Guardians, and there was no reason for him to refuse their cooperation.

Krishna and the other three and Minits nodded at each other silently. What happened after they left this labyrinth was something they could think about when we got out. This was the moment when the four of them came to a common understanding.

"So, how did Minits-sama get here?"

"I was dealing with a group of Army Wasps."

"Army Wasps...!"

The most dangerous monster in the world. They were so dangerous that they were dealt with quickly after they were discovered and were unknown to the general public. If they were known, they would have killed almost everyone, so in any case, they were unknown to the public.

"Such a dangerous monster, all by yourself?"

"I haven't met any of my colleagues other than you and the others since I entered this labyrinth. In my case, after defeating the Army Wasps and the queen-like majin, I was called by a voice. I found myself in this place."

"I see, I see..."

Krishna was impressed by Minits's quick reply.

If the Queen Wasp had turned into a majin, her power was unimaginable. It was probably as strong as a low-ranking demon lord. It was encouraging to see how strong Minits was, to have disposed of such an opponent along with all her subordinates.

Krishna was so nervous that he had not noticed before, but Minits had wounds all over his body. He also had a large hole in his chest, which told Krishna of a fierce battle.

"So, are you badly hurt?" Reicha asked, and Minits laughed.

"I have prepared some medicine. After a few more days of rest, I will regain my strength. But more importantly, what route did you take to get to this room?"

Minits was in charge. Although they were treated as equals, Minits still had the upper hand over Krishna and the others. Minits took the lead in sharing the information they had obtained. It turned out that the labyrinth had a distorted structure.

The reality was so different from the previous reports that there was nothing to base it on. It was as if they were groping their way through the labyrinth, and the outlook for the future was bleak.

"What the heck is going on here? We were dealing with the boss of the 60th floor as reported, weren't we? Why didn't Demon Lord Rimuru make us conquer them one by one?"

If he had, it would have taken them longer to conquer the bosses. Bazin spoke up with doubts.

"I think it would have been the right thing to do if it would have only exhausted us."

Minits answered the question.

"It's easy. You've heard the rumors about the labyrinth, haven't you? If you challenge it, you can come back to life as long as you wear the bracelet. What do you think would happen if that were applied to monsters?"

"Ah..." Bazin cried out in dismay, and Krishna and Reicha took over Minits's words with a bitter look on their faces.

"So you're saying that they can wear out the imperial army by accepting more and more of us, rather than letting us take longer to attack?"

"And once we're in, we can't get out. It's like they're asking to destroy us one by one."

Minits nodded.

"Of course, it was because we were confident of our strength in the labyrinth. I also made a proposal to Calgurio-sama. He told me that we should seize the bases for resurrection and kill them every time they come back to life. His opinion was reasonable, so I had no choice but to retreat."

Minits also bitterly told them that it was a mistake.

![break]

As a result, the Imperial Army had deployed more than 500,000 generals. This was the most foolish thing they could have done.

This was the result of misjudging the strength of the Demon Lord Rimuru's subordinates, who were guarding the labyrinth.

"And did you find any survivors?"

"Well..."

That was all that was needed to know.

They needed to assume that they were the only survivors.

"It's not so much that I don't believe it rather that I don't *want* to believe it. If we survive and can make it back to the surface, we must retreat as quickly as possible."

"His Majesty will be angry, but we have no choice."

No one objected to this conclusion. The policy was thus decided, and the next step was to ascertain the current situation.

"By the way, what is this place?"

"The drinks and fruits here are not tainted. We don't intend to take advantage of our enemies...but it's obvious that they're intending to host us."

"And that door. I pushed and pulled, but it wouldn't open. You see those numbers above it? We were talking about it until you came in, thinking it was a countdown."

From the door at the back of the room, an inexpressible, thick demonic presence seemed to be drifting in the air. Above the door that Bazin indicated, there was indeed a number displayed.

It was clear that it represented the time. The number was 200. This must mean that the door would open in a little over three hours.

Coincidentally, this was the same amount of time it would take for Minits to return to a state of perfect health.

Minits let out a sigh of relief, not believing this to be a coincidence.

"It seems that the enemy intends to fight us when we are in perfect condition. It may not be fair, but at least they are waiting for me to recover."

"And are they waiting for a few of us to come together, instead of challenging us one by one?"

"That must mean that they are very confident of their own strength."

"They're really taking advantage of us and His Excellency Minits, who buried the wight king's group."

"But I'll be lenient here. Kansas will be here soon, and the more time we can buy, the better off we'll be."

"Yes. We have to have more forces. If Kansas-dono joins us, it will not be impossible to break through this labyrinth."

"Yes. As for the keys, we have seven of them so far. Minits, you have one too, don't you?"

Reicha took out a medal and showed it to the audience. There were ten crystals in it, and seven of them had lights on them.

That medal was the key to challenge the king of the labyrinth.

"Of course. To challenge the king of the labyrinth, you must defeat the Elite Ten. By the time we entered the labyrinth, we had already obtained four keys."

"Yes. It seems that not only the dead spirit king, but also the dead spirit knight I defeated was of the Elite Ten."

"I see. Now, if Kansas wins and gets the key, we will have at least nine keys, including the one from the other side of this door. It's a faint glimmer of hope, but we have a clear path."

If they could go back down to the ground right now, they would swear never to enter this place again. That was how bad this labyrinth was. But that was a wish that would never come true. It was impossible to get out of here alive unless they defeated the enemy. They had prepared for that long ago when they entered the labyrinth. The only thing left for them to do was to keep pushing forward.

Thus, Minits and the others rested while awaiting the arrival of Kansas. They needed to recover from their fatigue here in order to improve their chances of winning. Even though there was no danger of poisoning, no one touched the foodstuffs that had been prepared. Each of them took out their personal food and made what might be their last energy boost.

All for the sake of survival.

![break]

With less than three minutes remaining, Minits and the others stood up. He checked the medal and was disappointed to see that the light had not increased.

"...Kansas may have been defeated."

No reinforcements showed signs of coming, even after waiting for more time. Minits and abandoned any naive expectations. He calmly assessed the situation and gave the right orders.

"It's time. About time that we get ready too."

The others of the Emperor's guard nodded silently. They took out their pendants and chanted a small password.

" " "Open!" " "

Without any loss of time, a torrent of light gushed out, completing their arming. The three Imperial Guardians were joined by Major General Minits, the most powerful of the Armored Corps. All four of them were the best of the Empire. With this lineup, conquering the labyrinth was not a dream. Yes, everyone believed so.

![break]

And so, the time of destiny had arrived. The time count advanced, and the time remaining was zero. At the same time, the front door opened. Everyone was prepared. Without hesitation, they entered through the doors and threw themselves into the battle for survival.

.........

......

...

Beyond the door was true darkness. It was a dark space where no light shone.

Reicha hurriedly activated the light elemental magic: Floor Light. What emerged drew gasps from everyone. It was a vast wasteland, where the corpses of imperial soldiers were piled high in a heap. At its peak was a single monster meditating in a cross-legged position.

It was Zegion. He was not seated directly on the corpses, but was slightly hovering in the air. Such a scene proved that Zegion had a highly sophisticated control of his mana.

Then, a low, resonant voice sounded throughout, "I welcome all ye brave ones."

With that single remark from Zegion, the atmosphere swelled, overwhelming the space.

Minits was convinced. This monster was the one who had invited him to this place, the Demon Lord Rimuru himself.

That is why he asked the question: "Are you...? Are you Demon Lord Rimuru?"

He had read the report that Demon Lord Rimuru was slime. But what could this mean? Since he was slime, perhaps it was not surprising that he could change into any form.

More than anything else, what this monster radiated was an overwhelming Demon Lord Haki. Minits thought that this was the proof that this monster was actually Demon Lord Rimuru.

However, his comment only served to anger Zegion.

"You dare to mistake me...for the great Demon Lord Rimuru-sama..."

"What?"

A feeling off intense rage enveloped the space.

At such a violent reaction, Minits realized his blunder.

"My name is Zegion and I am but one of the Dungeon's Elite Ten. You foolish ones, earth-crawling mongrels who deserve death."

Despite his fiery passion, Zegion spoke up rather blandly.

"There is only one way for you to survive: to defeat me. Burn your lives, and struggle against me with all your might!"

Although he spoke arrogantly in the face of these imperial champions, there was no arrogance in his tone.

It was made clear to Minits that Zegion was speaking the truth.

The only way to change Zegion's words would be to show him their strength.

"We're going to give it our all, guys!"

"Yes, sir."

"Got it."

"Of course."

And just like that, the battle began.

![hard scene break]

Is this for real? Benimaru and I were staring at the scene on the big screen. The images that had earlier been showing the labyrinth were now silent. It meant that the Imperial Army generals had died on all the other floors.

The battle was over.

However, the sheer content of what we had just seen was too much for words.

"That guy...He's stronger than you, isn't he?"

Finally, I managed to say an honest thought.

Benimaru's expression was bitter, as if he didn't want to admit it.

"It's possible, there is a small chance..."

He looked quite chagrined.

Benimaru also continued whispering, "But the probability is not zero..."

Just admit it. It was time to be honest.

"Kufufufu...I have fought that Zegion as well. In addition to his terrific fighting sense, he has an advantage over demons and can nullify even half-baked magic. He is a disciple of Veldora-sama, and even I was almost defeated by him. Well, it's not a defeat if I don't admit it as a defeat."

'Losing doesn't count unless I say so!' Diablo said such a thing with a smile, but it was no laughing matter for me.

As was the case with Razul, insectoid superiors were natural enemies of the demons. Zegion, too, seems to have been one of those beings.

By the way, it seems that Testarossa had also challenged Zegion, but she had never been able to beat him. Diablo had been very happy to see such a frustrated Testarossa.

Well, those three demon girls were extraordinary just by being able to fight against Zegion on equal terms.

That was my honest impression after seeing the fight just now.

Now then, it was time to review the battle.

.........

......

...

The battle in the labyrinth ended, more or less, as expected.

The plan of drawing them in was a great success, and Kumara's victory was also applauded.

Adalmann's group and Apito's side had regrets, but that was due to a bad match-up.

That said, there was someone who had rounded up all those strongmen together and even gave them time to recover.

It was all the work of Zegion.

Zegion had brought in all those he recognized as strong through his 'Spatial Manipulation'.

The most frightening thing about Zegion's work was his sense of perception. He must have been meditating and observing all of the battles in the labyrinth.

He did not intervene until the battles were over, and then had gathered only the most powerful survivors.

He was really doing something terrible.

If he lost the battle, the other Dungeon's Elite Ten would not have been silent about his foolishness.

However, no one complained.

Perhaps it was because the losers had no right to complain, but more than that, it was because everyone recognized the Zegion's strength.

"It shouldn't be a problem to just leave it to Zegion."

Veldora was also reported to have given his approval.

From my point of view and Benimaru's, I would have like to see a surefire victory. If he tried to heal the enemy and lost the battle...

Even if was worried about such a situation, there had only been four enemies left.

It seemed to me that complaining about such a small thing would not be the proper behavior of a demon lord.

I decided to be magnanimous and allow Zegion's selfishness to prevail.

Besides, I was able to gather combat information.

I thought it would be interesting to see Zegion's true ability here, so I decided to let him do as he liked.

The result was an overwhelming rampage.

In a word, it was one-sided.

The first to make a move was Bazin, who had fought alone against the death dragon. From the very first blow, Bazin struck Zegion with his full strength with a sword that seemed to shatter the earth.

Zegion received the blow with his left hand so as not to impede his opponent's movement. Bazin lost his balance and was unable to deliver a series of blows as the sword was gently pushed down the side of his body.

Zegion did not miss the opportunity and succeeded in getting close in. He stepped forward with his right foot with force, and at the same time, he drove his right fist into the opponent's armor.

I wondered how much power was put into that fist. The hardness of his fist was equivalent to legendary-grade armor.

Bazin's shining armor was shattered, and his life was taken.

That was less than three seconds after the battle began.

Their comrade had died so suddenly that they could not think straight. The female wizard named Reicha stood frozen. It is obvious what would happen to her if she acted like that in front of Zegion.

She was lucky.

She was able to die without pain and without fear.

Reicha was cut in two by hand and fell down.

Seeing this, Krishna, who had defeated Albert, screamed out.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! How dare you kill Reicha! Go to hell! Die, you monster!"

Krishna's rage increased his fighting spirit, unleashing his divine speed.

The Dimensional Slash was a slash that pierced through all defenses and severed all dimensions. Without Spatial Manipulation skills such as my 'Spatial Domination', it was impossible to fight against. It was not an exaggeration to say that it was a special kill shot, a blow comparable to that of a holy sword technique.

However, Zegion would not be defeated by it.

"Ridiculous!"

As Zegion said this, a distortion appeared around him.

Wait, isn't that a Distortion Field, the kind of 'Absolute Defense' from the 'Covenant King Uriel'?!

Zegion had mastered the 'Absolute Defense' perfectly, even though it had a reputation of being broken when I used it.

Zegion spoke to the astonished Krishna.

"Before this technique given to me by Rimuru-sama, any attack amounts to nothing!"

I don't remember teaching him this.

![break]

<<...>>

![break]

Wisdom King Raphael-san, so you did this...

I mean, Zegion's Spatial Domination ability was beyond the power of a Unique Skill. It was as good as what I used. That was why he could fight with Veldora in combat alone.

No wonder Krishna's attack was blocked.

It seemed that Krishna's team would never win the battle.

"Listen up, Krishna!"

That suavely dressed guy---Minits, I think his name was. Minits called out to Krishna.

"This guy is crazy. While I'm slowing him down, finish him off with everything you've got!"

Apparently, he had not given up the victory just yet. I praised him for that achievement, even if he was an enemy.

Minits covered Zegion with his own power. This power had already been revealed. Apito's defeat had not been in vain. Manipulation of gravity with the Unique Skill 'Oppressor'. Minits intended to use this power to concentrate the surrounding gravitational force on Zegion and constrain his movement.

But alas...

It did not work on Zegion.

By distorting the space around him, he was also able to manipulate the flow of gravity as well. I was so surprised to know that he could use it in such a way.

That said, why is Zegion so strong???

The doubts in my mind began to swell.

In the first place, how was Wisdom King Raphael-san able to instruct Zegion?

![break]

<<You may have forgotten, but the Master has given his flesh to Zegion. A "Soul Corridor" was connected to the Master's body.>>

![break]

I remember. When I saved Zegion from dying, I did indeed close his wound with a piece of my own body. But then, Apito had the same condition, didn't she?

![break]

<<Answer. It is due to the difference in talent. Individual Zegion's physical performance (specs) are extraordinary and he has been imposed the maximum degree of hyper-optimization. As a result, Zegion has acquired abilities similar to those of the Master.>>

![break]

Even though Apito was amazing enough, it seems that she was not enough for Wisdom King Raphael-san. It seemed to be satisfied with Zegion, so I guess I didn't really have a concrete idea of how great he was.

I mean, just what the hell is "hyper-optimization"?

That's just magical modification, isn't it?

I had never heard of that before...

That is to say, Zegion was the pure crystallization of Wisdom King Raphael-san's hobby. If I looked at it that way, it was no wonder he was so crazy. Wisdom King Raphael-san has a reputation of always going too far. It had done it again behind my back, huh?

Zegion, the ideal fighting-type majin, had blossomed after his training with Veldora. There was no way that anyone else could have matched him. And as expected...

"Dimensional Ray!"

Zegion opened the five fingers of his right hand and swung them down carelessly. Just by doing so, a dimensional disconnection, in other words, a spatial disconnection, occurred. This was also a phenomenon that could not be resisted without a Spatial Manipulation Skill.

The two Imperialists reacted quickly, but it was meaningless just to receive the attack. Krishna's attempt to counteract the attack with a dimensional cut was sliced in half. The difference in power was obvious.

Minits was trying to deflect the spatial rupture by surrounding himself with interference waves, but...This was also a futile attempt. Almost all physical phenomena could not counter a spatial distortion.

The look of surprise on his face was beyond description. It was the look of a man who had never been defeated by anyone before, and had now been defeated for the first time.

Minits probably left to the other side before ever even admitting his defeat.

.........

......

...

And just like that, less than a minute after the battle began, the challengers were all dead. As one could see, Zegion was very strong. I was surprised by Kumara's extraordinary strength, but Zegion's strength was far beyond that. In some cases, he might even be better than me.

No way. That's impossible. He was already beyond limits of biology. He was definitely a transcendent being, stronger than a serious Hinata. According to my calculations, Apito was as strong as Karion or Frey. But even Apito would not be able to stand even three minutes against Zegion.

If Zegion got serious, the battle would be over in an instant. No, that would no longer be a battle. That would just be a one-sided massacre.

How is such a strong person just nesting in the labyrinth? Isn't it a waste?---I thought about this, but he really was a secret weapon. I shouldn't let this guy be released to the world.

And so, I let it be.

But even so...

I knew there were strongmen lurking in this world, and I wasn't going to let my guard down, but... I never thought that such an extraordinary person would be hiding out in our country. I thought he had looked strong, but he was far beyond my imagination. Indeed, this world was an incomprehensible place. Or rather, more importantly than that...there was something else to reflect on.

If I kept entrusting Wisdom King Raphael-san with things, things could really get terribly out of hand. I couldn't afford to be lazy now, either. We would have to have a long talk later to see if it had done anything else.

With that in mind, I was relieved that the battle in the labyrinth had ended without incident.

![soft scene break]

Thus, of the 700,000 Imperial troops who had attacked from the ground, more than 530,000 had been eliminated. It was a virtual massacre, but for me it meant that I had gained the souls of more than 500,000 people.

This made up more than 770,000 souls in total. I was now able to evolve seven of our own leaders. When the remaining ground battles were over, I would consider who to evolve.

As for the ground battle, we still had to be on our guard.

"The remaining imperial army is less than 200,000. It's a large army, but it seems small compared to the beginning."

"Yes. It's been two days since the last mission to the labyrinth, but there has been no movement. There is no sign of more troops. Honestly, the enemy commanders must be incompetent if they are still sticking to the labyrinth."

Well, Benimaru was right. Now that they were slowly losing their strength, I didn't think they could deploy soldiers to the labyrinth anymore. In that case, we would have to go out there ourselves.

Now that Over A rank soldiers were gone, the strength of the enemy army was greatly reduced. They were numerous, but we should be able to take them.

I thought so, but I was still worried.

"So, what should we do? Not only the number of soldiers but also their quality is still better than ours, isn't it? If we send Second Corps like this, there will be casualties anyhow, won't there?"

We could stay here and wait for them to run out of food. That way, we could aim for an unscathed victory. In our case, we could fight for a year with the food we had stored in the labyrinth. We had a certain number of crops, and when the time came, we could even ask Ramiris to increase the area of our farmland.

If we were being careful, we would go with this strategy.

"We have already cut off the enemy's supply lines. In effect, we are winning strategically. Now it's just a matter of what to do afterwards---"

"Hmph! As you said the other day, we are not going to let the invaders return alive, are we? That's right, Benimaru, you can count on us!"

Right in the middle of Benimaru's explanation, Shion interrupted. Benimaru laughed at her comment.

It seems that she had been right.

"I won't let the empire have any more foolish ambitions. For that reason, we must kill all intruders."

Benimaru also said the same thing as Wisdom King Raphael-san. He was not satisfied with destroying the majority of the imperial army, but rather, as he had originally planned, he remained on the policy of killing all the enemies once and for all. Indeed, he was a man who showed no mercy to his enemies.

I didn't disagree with him on this point. I was ready. Even if I would be resented, only the subjects of the empire would hate us. I just didn't want our bad reputation to spread to the Western Nations...

![break]

<<Report. I have a proposal that I would like to try.>>

![break]

Oh? Wisdom King Raphael-san seems to have a plan. It doesn't always say it like this, so I guess it is not sure about the success rate.

Is it something we can do right now?

![break]

<<Negative. It would be better to do it after the war is over, because it requires preparation and time.>>

![break]

I see. Well, we certainly can't start any strange experiments during the war. I don't know what it's planning to do, but I'm the one who will end up doing it. We would discuss this matter later.

I returned my attention to Benimaru. I understood about killing off everyone. The only thing left to do was to make an important request that there would be no casualties on our side.

"Is it possible without having anyone killed on our side?"

"As long as we, the leaders, are in charge."

They were confident as ever.

And to Benimaru's words, not only Diablo and Shion, but even the mild-mannered Geld nodded their heads.

"So, what exactly are you planning to do?" I asked, and Benimaru started to explain.

"We must definitely guard Rimuru-sama."

Everyone nodded. Everyone seemed to agree.

"Didn't we kill everyone who entered the labyrinth except for Lucius and Raymond? Do we have to be so careful?"

Those two aforementioned people were still prisoners of war. I didn't take them into custody because they didn't seem like they would betray me. Just in case, they were being kept on the 60th floor, where they were protected by Gadra.

Gadra was showing them the battles at each floor of the battle because he thought things would be boring for them. Lucius and Raymond's reactions were also recorded, and they were absolutely amazed at the way the labyrinth guardians fought.

*"Hey, defecting to this side was right, wasn't it?"*

*"That's right. You should be thankful to us."*

*"You should be grateful to us for at least three meals."*

*"Well, well, well. We've been down this road before. I understand how you feel."*

Gadra and Shinji and the others were very comforting to them. I didn't think we needed to worry.

Now we had to check if anyone invaded the town before the war started.

"Souei, did anyone invade the town?"

"Don't worry. We've already taken care of it."

I'm sure he had.

But the fact that Souei answered like this meant that I could rest assured.

![break]

<<This time, we have succeeded in eliminating every single person who entered the labyrinth. We confirmed that only Krishna used the Resurrection Bracelet, but since he is out of the labyrinth, it is not a problem.>>

![break]

Oh, so Krishna survived.

He was quite strong, but Wisdom King Raphael-san already knew that information. So it was not a problem.

"Well, the labyrinth seems to be safe now, so I guess we don't have to worry that much. In the first place, those Kansas, Minits, Imperial Guardians, and others of that class would have been stronger than me before I became a demon lord. Chloe told me that I didn't evolve into a demon lord at that time, so it's no wonder they killed me, right?"

In that situation, Diablo wouldn't have been there either. Since Veldora had not been revived yet, Zegion and others must have been in a state before they had evolved.

In terms of strength, they would have been much weaker than they are now.

If the empire had attacked us in such a situation, I would not be surprised if we would have been defeated and that I would have died.

![break]

<<...It's not possible.>>

![break]

No, no, no, it's possible, isn't it?

I know Wisdom King Raphael-san hates to lose, but that's just being a sore loser.

I mean, it had been 'Great Sage' at that time.

![break]

<<...>>

![break]

Well, you beat me to it.

It's been a long time since I've won like this.

![full page image](image10)

Well, there was no such thing as winning or losing when it came to an argument like this.

"Indeed, Rimuru-sama may be correct..." Benimaru agreed, looking unlikely to accept it.

Shion, however, was adamant in her refusal to admit it.

"No! There is no such thing as defeat!"

No, no, it was definitely possible.

As much as I'd like to say that history would prove it, there was a different history now. It was hard to explain it to someone like Shion unless the truth was right in front of her.

I gave up on explaining to Shion and decided to go back to the story.

"Well, it doesn't make sense to discuss it now. What is important is the fact that there were strongmen in the empire. There may be others left, and we can never be too careful. I'm glad you want my protection, but I don't want you to get hurt because of it."

The labyrinth was probably safe, and I thought it would be better to settle this all at once.

That was my intention, but it seemed that my words had tremendous power.

"Kufufufu, if Rimuru-sama insists so, I will go out to the battle. I will end this battle in an instant!"

"Diablo, I won't allow you to run away! I will not give up this opportunity to introduce my secret troops to Rimuru-sama!"

"Milord, wait a minute! Testa and Ult were given a chance to play a part, but I was left out! Give me the order to go out too!"

Diablo, Shion, and Carrera, who opened the door and jumped in, began to make a big fuss that they were going to go out.

"You guys...!"

Benimaru was also stunned by this.

Even Geld was laughing.

"Okay, okay. I'll just stay here and leave the final battle to you."

In the end, Benimaru agreed to allow Diablo and the team to go out to the battlefield.

![soft scene break]

In this way, the main question became what kind of strategy should be adopted.

"Let's confirm our strength. The main force will be my 30,000 Red Numbers and 17,000 elite soldiers from Geld's Yellow and Orange Numbers. In terms of quality, we'll be on par with the remaining Imperial Guard, and I'm connected to the commanders and captains by a 'Telepathy Net'. I am sure that we can make flexible tactical actions, and if the situation is limited, we can have a more than even battle. So, Shion, how many of your secret troops do you have?"

The current battle strength was 47,000. On average, they were equivalent to B-plus rank, so it was a sufficient force. But the number of the Imperial Army was almost four times as large... We might be defeated at this rate, no matter how much of an operational advantage we have...

"It's 10,000 in all. By the way, I have left only those who have endured my training, so you can consider them to be of B-plus rank or higher at least."

Shion's escort---commonly known as the Shion fan club.

It was a mysterious unit, separate from Yomigaeri and lead by Dagruel's sons, but its size had swelled beyond my imagination.

"Are there really that many of them?"

I was surprised that they had grown to such an extent while I was away from them for a while. I knew that Gobzo and others had joined, but there seemed to be all sorts of other colorful members...

"Yes! I have been secretly training them myself to be a suitable part of Rimuru-sama's escort!"

"Hmmm...but that's your escort, not mine."

Oh well...

At times like these, I would just be glad to have more reliable allies.

"Even so, we're outnumbered by far. So, I'm counting on the leaders' performances. First, confuse them with your big moves, and then hit them hard. Of course, the enemy will not just stand by and watch. Who will be the first to go out, assuming they are interrupted?"

Originally, Benimaru was supposed to be in charge of this role.

This was the time when a wide-area incineration attack---Hell Flare---would be the best option. Unfortunately, Benimaru was going to remain here as my escort.

So then, who would go?

"Milord, I'm still here, aren't I?"

Well...yeah.

I suppose she was very qualified.

I glanced at Benimaru, and our eyes met. He gave me a small nod, so I decided to leave it to Carrera.

"Kufufufu, this is my---"

"---Okay, I'll leave it to Carrera. Use your flashy magic and knock those Imperial Guards off their feet!"

"Leave it to me Milord!"

Ah, Diablo had been about to say something too.

"Sorry, Diablo. What were you going to say?"

"No, no. It's nothing. Nothing important. Good for you, Carrera."

"Oh! I'm so happy!"

Sparks seemed to be flying between Diablo and Carrera.

Could it be that Diablo was planning to recommend himself?

If so, I felt bad, but I wondered if Diablo could handle large-scale magic?

It should work.

I wondered if he was trying to do his best in front of me.

I felt a little sorry for him just thinking about it.

"I'm sorry, Diablo, but I was actually thinking that I wanted you to take out the enemy commander-in-chief!"

I jumped down from my chair and stood in front of Diablo, transforming from slime to human form. I put my hand on his shoulder saying that I had been thinking about it.

"What?"

Diablo's cheeks loosened.

He looked so happy.

That's good.

"You know, perhaps there's a strongman hiding amongst them that we haven't seen yet. That Krishna guy from earlier seems to be back, so it should be easy for you to follow his trail, don't you think?"

This guy was a bit of a stalker, so he should be good at that kind of thing. When I asked him about it, he answered cheerfully saying, "Of course, Rimuru-sama!"

I nodded my head, thinking 'sure enough' to myself.

"There may be more powerful and fearsome people hiding in the empire. I think we need to show them our power here in order to find them. Carrera, Diablo, I'll put you up to the task!"

"I swear I'll do my best, milord!"

"Rimuru-sama's order---my heart is pounding!"

Thank goodness. Carrera looked happy to have her turn, and Diablo's mood was much better now.

This would make things way easier for Geld and the others.

"Make sure that Carrera's magic will not be interfered with by the other troops. And if anyone should appear to get in the way, then Shion, your unit will deal with them."

Benimaru took over my words and sent out instructions. I guess I could leave the rest to him.

"As for the formation, Geld will be in the front row, and Shion will playing guerilla tactics as I just said. We can count on the firepower of Red Numbers for the pursuit, but as to who will be in charge of the command---"

That person needed to be connected to Benimaru by a 'Telepathy Net' and able to reflect his will immediately. Although the 'Telepathy Net' allowed orders to reach the end of the line, a wrong action on the battlefield could be fatal. A person who could make detailed corrections was absolutely necessary.

Gobua should be able to play such a role, but it might be too much for Shion and Geld.

"Then Gobua---"

"Please wait!"

As if interrupting Benimaru's words, the door to the Control Room suddenly opened.

In came Momiji, the acting leader of the tengu clan.

She was also Hakurou's daughter, so she was a close friend of ours. But still, it was a problem that she could enter the Control Room so easily in this heavily guarded environment...

"Well, Shuna-sama kindly invited us in."

I see.

Shuna had been doing all the hard work of bringing in food and preparing tea and such. It seems that Momiji had been helping Shuna with these things.

So I decided to listen to Momiji's story.

"I believe that the role of a substitute for Benimaru-sama should be my responsibility as his future wife!"

"What are you talking about---?!"

The substitute for Benimaru in this battle couldn't be just anyone. However, Momiji was a good choice. Her strength was impeccable, and she would not be intimidated by Shion or Geld because of her temperament.

"That's fine, isn't it?"

I accepted Momiji's offer.

"Momiji-dono, you can count on me as a sister-in-arms!"

Shion had no complaints. She seemed to be quite comfortable with her since she knew that she was Hakurou's daughter.

"I agree with you. The Red Numbers are a meritocratic unit of majin. I think it's better to ask for the tengu's cooperation than use the Kurenai alone."

Geld said this, and no complaints had been heard from the other executives.

"Since there seems to be no opposition, why don't you leave this to your wife, Benimaru-kun?"

"No, but..."

Was Benimaru against it?

It's not certain, but perhaps he didn't want to send his wife to the battlefield.

"I see, you're worried about your wife."

"That's one thing, but...huh? No, it's not!"

Benimaru almost confessed to the truth, but he hurriedly tried to deny it. Then, he was unexpectedly interrupted.

"Big brother!"

The door opened with a loud bang, and Shuna was standing on her haunches, shouting to Benimaru.

"Momiji-sama has been preparing your meals for the past few days! She wants you to eat delicious food, and she asked me to teach her how to cook. You can't disrespect her kind attitude."

"Is that so?"

"Yes," Momiji nodded.

Actually, I had noticed that too. Compared to Shuna's cooking, there was still differences in some areas. That is why I was willing to accept Momiji's offer.

"But that has nothing to do with..."

"Brother!"

"Ugh!"

Is Benimaru also weak against his sister?

"In the first place, it's Brother's fault for being indecisive. That's why Momiji-sama is worried. If you're a man, you should just make it clear just who you love!"

Ah, yes indeed.

I wondered which one, between Alvis or Momiji, Benimaru would choose. But I didn't think this was the time to talk about it.

I felt for Benimaru from the bottom of my heart.

I, too, would not have wanted to talk about this in front of everyone.

"No, Shuna-sama. Victory is something we take in our own hands!" Momiji declared emphatically.

Alvis was at a huge disadvantage. Momiji had done a better job of laying the groundwork.

Just as was thinking that...

"I won't allow you to sneak away!"

To my surprise, even Alvis appeared. She stepped out from behind Shuna.

"I have just arrived with reinforcements from Eurazania," she said.

Alvis had brought a letter from Milim, which I had neither asked for nor heard about.

'Do your best!'---was the only sentence written on the letter.

That could be interpreted in various ways, depending on who it was addressed to. Regardless of that...

How did Alvis get into the labyrinth?

"Milim-sama used magic. Rimuru-sama developed it himself, didn't he?"

Yeah, sure...

So Milim got permission from Ramiris through 'telepathy' and sent her army directly into the labyrinth.

I thought it was a crazy move, but Milim could do anything.

Plus, Alvis was leading an army of 20,000 men. Not only beastmen, but there were also harpies. Some members of Beast Master's Warrior Alliance were also participating.

Even Benimaru put on a bitter face about this.

He could not refuse Alvis's reinforcements as long as it was Milim's intention, and Momiji would never back down now that this was the case.

"Okay, okay. Momiji, I entrust you with my army. You can take my place."

"With pleasure!"

Momiji looked happy.

And thus, the battle of the women began once more.

"I hope you won't drag me down."

"Hmmm, just what is that supposed to mean?"

I wondered if things could go wrong as I watched the sparks fly off the wall.

![soft scene break]

After all that had happened, the team that was to go out was finally decided.

For what it's worth, Alvis and the others were great reinforcements.

Although we were still at a disadvantage in numbers, I thought that we had a lot more room to maneuver.

Geld was in the front row, Momiji was the rear.

Guerilla forces were on both flanks. Shion was on the right flank and Alvis on the left.

I felt a little better, but the battle was not over yet. I ordered the corps to get ready for battle.

Shion and Geld began to move as if they had been waiting for me. Momiji followed them, and the Control Room became a flurry of activity.

On the ninety-fifth floor, which was now the hundredth floor, there was a large vacant lot. It was not big enough for military training, but there was no problem even if all the members gathered there.

And so, the members of Geld's Second Corps and Benimaru's Fourth Corps were waiting in the vicinity of the 100th floor.

They would gather in an hour or so, so I decided to go out to inspire them. In any case, the corps would have to be transported to the ground by transfer magic, and I was the only one who could handle that kind of magic.

"Rimuru-sama, may I have a word?" Souei asked me as I was getting ready to move.

"What is it?"

"Yes. I just got a call from Moss. He said he detected signs of battle in the Blumund area. He says that Treyni-dono and someone else are engaged in battle."

"What?"

Come to think of it, Treyni-san hadn't been seen for about ten days now. She had left the labyrinth saying that she was going to meet some suspicious guy, but she hadn't come back yet.

Could she have been fighting with them ever since?

"Souei, I'm sorry, but could you go and help her?"

Souei hesitated for a moment when I asked him. I guess he was worried about my reduced protection, but I honestly thought everyone was worrying too much.

I didn't expect them to be so nervous.

Benimaru was still with me, and I could call the Dungeon's Elite Ten if the time came. I was more worried about Treyni-san than myself.

Souei exchanged glances with Benimaru and nodded his head. He seemed to think that if Benimaru was there, then everything would be all right.

I felt happy, frustrated, and other mixed feelings about the fact that he was so worried about me.

Well, Chloe had said that I was killed. But I'm a demon lord now.

Wisdom King Raphael-san would let me know if anything happened, so there was no use in worrying about it.

"Yes, sir. Then I'll leave immediately."

"Please do."

As soon as I said that, Souei disappeared. As usual, it was a perfect "Instantmove".

If Treyni-san had been fighting for a long time, the opponent must be a very good fighter. If so, I think she can win if Souei joins her.

I was a little worried about them, and I was curious to know what kind of opponent they were, but I couldn't make any more moves. First, we had to finish the battle at hand.

One hour later...

A large number of majin were crowded into a vacant lot on the 100th floor.

When I showed up, they all stood erect and silent. It was a bit scary, but they were so well organized.

Morale was high, and they seemed to be very motivated.

"Uh...everybody! We're going to drive out the Imperial Guard in this one battle. Our goal is complete victory. Make sure that no one is left behind and that everyone comes back alive. That is all!"

As I've said before, I'm really not good at giving speeches. I wish Wisdom King Raphael-san would write the speech so I can read it out loud, but it just pretends not to hear me only at these times. I had to do my best to convey the message in my own words, which, surprisingly, was accepted by the majins. I heard later that it was a big hit not only with the old majins but also with the new majins.

"Woo, woo, woo, woo! The words of His Majesty Rimuru---they're the best!"

"I can die happily now. I have no regrets!"

"You idiot! You'll be killed if you die!"

---Something like that.

Unaware of this, I sent the silent army back to the ground with a transfer spell.

![soft scene break]

Well, the scene became lonely all at once.

Shion and Diablo went off together, so it was just me and Benimaru left here.

"They're going to win, right?"

"Yes, it will be no problem. I didn't see any movement among the Imperial Guard generals, but there were signs of a flurry of activity at the top floor. Krishna and the others must have reported what happened in the labyrinth. Once they realize they're the only survivors, they'll pull out. Well, before that, I'm not going to let the situation get to that point."

Benimaru answered with a wry smile.

That's right.

I, too, would be worried about losing contact with my subordinates, so I would take some countermeasures at that point.

To tell the truth, I had not expected them to fall for our plan so splendidly.

"You can't be greedy in anything you do."

"Yes, that's true. War and looting go hand in hand, but at least in our army, that's forbidden."

Excellent.

In war, the side that loses their cool suffers the loss, but when their desires are stimulated, they immediately become passionate. In this case, we took advantage of this habit, and it worked frighteningly well.

I would take this case as a lesson to us and be careful not to get ourselves into the same situation.

I was about to return to the Control Room when I discussed with Benimaru about something.

I suddenly thought of a possibility.

"If something happened now, wouldn't we just only have you and me here?"

"Yes."

"Well then, if there are enemies hiding in the labyrinth, I'm sure they wouldn't let this opportunity pass by, would they?"

"No way. There's no way they couldn't make a move at such a good time."

"That's right."

That's right.

I was just being paranoid.

Even Wisdom King Raphael-san assured us that the labyrinth was safe. There was no end to doubts once you get started, so I thought it would be better to stop thinking about this matter.

The reason why I kept thinking the same thing over and over again was because I had anxiety in my mind. I've had a bad feeling about this since a while ago...

![break]

<<...?>>

![break]

No, it's nothing.

I'm not doubting Wisdom King Raphael-san, but I've been wondering if I'm missing something.

![break]

<<Answer. All suspicious persons have been confirmed.>>

![break]

I trust that they have.

But on the other hand. What if it's someone we know well?

Elen and the others, for example. We trust them, so if they betrayed us, they could do a lot of damage.

Of course, that was just a metaphor.

There was no reason for Elen and the others to betray me, and we had built up trust in each other. I can assure that they would be fine.

But I wondered if it was really true for all the others...

![break]

<<...>>

![break]

Our country's executives were fine.

Myourmiles-kun and others were working hard and sleeping hard. I couldn't doubt him.

The other people I had gotten to know well were those who came to stay in my country after the Founding Festival.

Yes, for example...

"Mr. Rimuru...!"

I saw people coming from Labyrinth City.

No way. It couldn't be them.

Waving his hand at the front was Masayuki-kun, whom I knew very well. There were two other followers of Masayuki.

A warrior and a magician, their names were Jinrai and Bernie, I believe. I hadn't talked with them much because they were still hostile to me until now.

"I don't think this, but is there a possibility that Masayuki is after me?"

"No, no, that's too much to think about."

"True."

Benimaru dismissed my concerns.

I didn't want to doubt Masayuki either.

By the way, Gadra had said that Masayuki looked just like Emperor Rudra or something like that.

No, no, no, no...it's just that he happened to look similar.

![break]

<<Answer. After considering the history of the empire and many other factors, there is a 0 percent chance that Masayuki is the same person as Emperor Rudra.>>

![break]

That's right.

At ease for the time being, I replied to Masayuki.

"Oh, Masayuki, is something wrong?"

"You ask me! You appointed me as the leader of the corps without my permission, so I'm in a lot of trouble! Even the vampire members are asking me to join temporarily, and it's really hard for me. Then, there was a flurry of activity earlier, wasn't there? That's when everyone started to make a fuss about what's going on..."

Masayuki said that the number of applicants was increasing rapidly, and just organizing them was a challenge. The army had just gone into action under such circumstances, he said, and the bloodthirsty people were now making a fuss.

His face was so gaunt that he did not look like he was acting. If Masayuki were suspicious, Wisdom King Raphael-san would have warned us earlier.

So, Masayuki was excluded from the list.

"Most of them are staying in their original towns, aren't they?"

"Yes, they are, but..."

The town used to be on the ground, but it was now evacuated to the 101st floor below the ground. The sun's rays and the stars were still visible, so one may be surprised if people were upset about situation. The war had already started, but some people seemed to think that the standoff was still going on in some distant place.

The 20,000 strong Volunteer Corps were in charge of maintaining the security of the town, but such a situation had not caused any confusion. Masayuki himself, however, seemed to have been quite busy.

The problem was the researchers living in "Labyrinth City". They were supposed to be clerical workers, but most of them, who were sent by Luminas, were Calamity-class researchers.

They were called "Surmounters," and they had a lot of free time on their hands. To them, this war was also like a celebration, and they even went to negotiate with Masayuki, saying that their willingness to participate was high.

Bacchus, who was dispatched by the Holy Knight Order, and Jiwu, a girl who was a friend of Masayuki's group, were in the process of appeasing them. They said that they wanted something to help because they could not get things under control at this point.

It's possible that they were stirring up Masayuki to cause a commotion. There was a possibility that they would have targeted me, but I think they would have taken action much earlier.

So, it seemed unlikely.

I gave a sigh, thinking that I was overthinking things.

"I'm sorry about that..."

"Right? Please do something!"

"Don't worry. The war will be over soon."

"No, no, no, it's not that easy to just let it be someone else's problem..."

Masayuki complained to me with a pitiful look on his face.

However, don't underestimate my ability to get through to him. I didn't have time to get myself involved in such troubles.

I was tired of doubting others and I wanted to go back to the Control Room as soon as possible. Then, I'd have Shuna make me a cup of tea and eat a nice cake.

"I bet you're just trying to escape!"

"Hahaha!"

It was a barbaric argument, but this was the secret of laziness.

I hoped Masayuki would follow my example and reach to this level. That's the reason why I was pushing Masayuki away.

"If that's all you wanted, I'm going back."

"Is the war really going to be over soon?"

"I'm hoping to end it today."

"We haven't done anything, and it doesn't feel like it, but we've been fighting for some time..."

I guess that was true.

My ideal type of warfare was to keep the public out of it.

"Yes. That's why, don't worry about it." I smiled and said this to Masayuki to convince him.

Problem solved. Hurry back now. Strawberry shortcake...

"Hey, hey, wait just a minute. Masayuki-san went out looking for you, so I've been holding back, but we still haven't given up on defeating you, have we? Forgetting that and trying to take advantage of us is a bit too much of a joke, don't you think?"

Just when I thought I had solved the problem, a new one popped up.

Jinrai, who I had thought was just a lackey for Masayuki, voiced his dissatisfaction here.

"I don't think that; I think there's a misunderstanding here. I don't want to take advantage of you, so that's not very nice..."

I excused myself, but that was a pretty bad thing to say. I was trying to take advantage of him, that's for sure, and this might not work.

Just when I was in a hurry, I got an unexpected reinforcement.

"Jinrai! You're out of line! Rimuru-san is doing his best for the people of this town right now!" Masayuki calmed Jinrai down.

Thank you. I'll treat you to a cake later!

I gave him a grateful look.

Jinrai stopped complaining as soon as Masayuki gave him a warning. Jinrai may have had some complaints, but he seemed to have enough courage to swallow them. I thought he was a surprisingly mature man in spite of his face.

Anyway, the case was closed. I thought as such, but that was not the case.

"Jinrai is right, Masayuki-kun. Don't hold back forever, let's get this guy out of the way!"

Bernie, who always stood back and watched from the sidelines, turned hot-blooded only at a time like this.

I felt sorry for him and wondered how to calm him down.

"If Masayuki-kun won't do it, I'll defeat him for you!"

Bernie said this and began chanting a spell.

I thought, "Oh, come on," but the next moment, he turned serious.

"Holy Purification Barrier!"

'That's ridiculous!' I almost shouted.

This magic was difficult to handle, and only a few people could handle it alone. Bernie was an otherworlder, and I had heard that he was good at magic, but I had not expected him to be able to handle such a high level of holy magic.

I mean, this was really...

![break]

<<Notice. Confirmed intent to kill. Individual "Bernie" is the enemy!>>

![break]

At that moment, it finally dawned on me.

I had been trying to convince myself that I was worrying too much, wondering how it could be possible. But it turned out this was exactly what Bernie right in front of me was.

And someone else moved even faster than I did.

A clear, high-pitched sound. It was caused by the clash of Benimaru's sword and Bernie's sword of light.

"Bernie, you...you can handle a sword too?"

Jinrai was surprised.

This must have been the first time that Bernie had used a sword. That meant that Bernie had been deceiving Masayuki and the others all this time.

"Hmph, I would never be so foolish as to reveal my hand so easily."

His expression told us eloquently that if he was going to do so, he would aim for a sure-fire kill.

"Damn it! You've been lying not only me but also to Masayuki-san!"

"That's not a very nice thing to say. I was just using him to get close to the demon lord."

"U-Using him?"

"Yes. Masayuki-kun worked well for us. And thanks to him, we have the best opportunity ever. I'm grateful."

Even though he was crossing swords with Benimaru, Bernie was talking with Jinrai in a relaxed manner. It was not for me to say, but he seemed to have a great deal of ability hidden in him.

"Benimaru, I'm going to join in now..."

"No, I'll take care of him. Rimuru-sama, please be on the lookout."

I was about to join him, but Benimaru stopped me. I decided to trust Benimaru and strengthened my vigilance. Even under such circumstances, the conversation between Bernie and Jinrai continued.

"You've got to be kidding me! Masayuki-san worked for your convenience?"

"Yeah.---I'm sure you're already aware of it. He's really not much of a man and lives only by bluffing."

Masayuki's face turned pale when he heard this.

'How mean'---I thought, but I guess it was a matter of life and death for Masayuki. However, Jinrai's next remark was something we did not expect.

"What about it? Masayuki-san is a great guy, bluff or no bluff! He's never once failed us!"

He really noticed it.

He had seen through Masayuki's true essence that he wasn't merely a bluffing kid.

I began looking at Jinrai in a new light.

Masayuki also looked at Jinrai with incredulity.

However, Bernie did not like Jinrai's reaction.

"Damn, so you were aware of it, but you stuck with him anyway. And you respect such an incompetent person? Don't make me laugh." He spat this out in frustration.

But I was the one who was annoyed.

"What's wrong with bluffing? I'm always bluffing for a living!"

"Ri-Rimuru-san..."

"But it's true! I used to be nothing more than a businessman. I didn't live in a world of demon lords and heroes. But even so, I'm doing my best because I have to. I don't want to be laughed at by people who don't know anything!"

Masayuki nodded silently at my words.

"Y-You..."

Even Jinrai looked at me puzzled.

I continued without giving a second thought.

"Isn't that obvious? One must always convince themselves that they are doing the right thing, or else there is no way to be the king!"

Using the momentum of my shout, I walked up next to Masayuki. Slowly, so as not to provoke Bernie, who was crossing swords with Benimaru.

"Everybody is just trying to survive, you know. That's why I'm trying to make a world where everyone can live happily together. Masayuki is helping me. He's a big help! I won't allow you to make fun of Masayuki like an idiot!" I said to Bernie as I stood in front of Masayuki.

Jinrai nodded his head deeply at my words.

And Masayuki, too.

"Bernie, did you intend to use me from the beginning?"

He asked Bernie openly, as if his panicked look just now had been a hallucination.

"That's what I said." Bernie replied carelessly, while keeping his distance from Benimaru.

Benimaru was also standing in front of me, staring at Bernie. Under the influence of the Holy Purification Barrier, Benimaru was not able to exert his full strength. Perhaps that was why he seemed to watching the situation instead of attacking all at once.

"Was it Yuuki-san's order?"

"Huh? Oh, I see. Fufu, I'd be happy to tell you, but I don't see the benefit."

And just like that, Bernie made a mocking remark, but he seemed to intend to continue the conversation, at least for the time being.

Was it because the "Holy Purification Barrier" was stable, and he did not doubt his superiority?

![break]

<<Negative. There must be a purpose---some information has been confirmed. There is another member of Masayuki's group. We have searched the information and found that this person was not in the labyrinth. No record of absence. This person is--->>

![break]

Reports were coming in from Wisdom King Raphael-san at a frightening rate. From the fact that the information had not been sorted out yet, Wisdom King Raphael-san must have judged that the situation was very urgent.

Among Masayuki's friends, there was another girl named Jiwu, I believe. She and Bacchus were said to be appeasing the Surmounters...

![break]

<<Confirmed. A mass murder has occurred in the laboratory on the 100th floor. Individual Bacchus and several Surmounters have been slaughtered. As an emergency measure, the souls have been protected--->>

![break]

That's a big deal!

Aside from Bacchus, each of the "Surmounters" were a monster of Special A rank. It was a little unbelievable that they all were killed in such a short time after they left Masayuki.

It was very difficult to defeat a defensive "Surmounter". After all, they had 'Ultraspeed Regeneration' and many other special abilities.

Perhaps if it was Benimaru with his huge firepower, or Zegion with his extraordinary evolution... But the other "Elite Ten" including Kumara would not be able to do so.

And there was one more important point.

Jiwu's lack of a response was information that could not be ignored. Because Wisdom King Raphael-san knew about everything in the labyrinth. And yet, if it could not find her, it meant that Jiwu...

<Rimuru-sensei!>

A voice echoed faster than 'Telepathy Net' entered directly into my mind. At that moment, my time was prolonged by 'Thought Acceleration'.

Was it me or Wisdom King Raphael-san who reacted?

Either way, it saved our lives.

"Die!"

A flash of darkness hit me, right in the chest.

Someone---perhaps Jiwu---had taken a shot at me in perfect concealment. But I had succeeded in escaping from her deadly blade because I had dropped all pretense and rolled over on the spot.

It was all thanks to that warning voice.

That voice belonged to a little girl. It was Chloe---wearing a mask.

She had reverted to her old way of calling me, but I had no time to point that out.

This was not good.

I was on full alert, and Wisdom King Raphael-san was also on alert. There was only one possibility that allowed them to have slipped through my watch.

In other words, this assassin had one.

An Ultimate Skill.

I finally confirmed the assassin's appearance, and it was Jiwu. However, her expressionless face was still the same, but the atmosphere was different from before. It was no exaggeration to say that she was a different person, cold and sharp.

"I'm surprised. You've been following me without my knowledge."

Jiwu didn't seem upset that she had failed to assassinate me. She pointed the black blade extending from the pendant in her hand at Chloe and spoke to her without hesitation.

"It's natural that you would notice my presence if you were fighting so brazenly."

"You're pretty good, little one."

"I don't need you to tell me that, and I'm not little!"

At the moment she said this, Chloe's figure changed to that of an adult. Then, she pulled out her Moonlight saber.

Its mythical-grade brilliance was directed at Jiwu, and then it suddenly stopped.

The masked Hero Chloe had arrived.

"Damn, I never thought I'd make such a big mistake in this perfectly arranged opportunity. This was a blunder, Jiwu!" Bernie clicked his tongue, and then spoke in a displeased tone.

"I'm sorry. I was trying to stay out of the way, but I didn't know there was such a hidden person." Jiwu replied, not the least bit offended.

These two were acquaintances. It seemed that they were also highly skilled assassins sent by someone who wanted to kill me.

Their positions appeared to be evenly matched. In other words, there was a strong possibility that Bernie was also an Ultimate Skill holder.

Bernie was staring at Benimaru.

Jiwu was holding a sword against Chloe.

I stood in front of Masayuki and Jinrai to protect them and watched what was happening.

"So it's come to this," said Chloe. "Now that the whole operation to not expose me has failed, there's no point in hiding what I can do."

"I agree. The enemy must be destroyed immediately."

Bernie and Jiwu then put power into the pendants that were the source of their weapons. In response, the pendants glowed strongly.

That light was familiar.

"So, you're Imperial Guardians too?" I muttered something like that, and Bernie, who had finished arming himself, nodded in agreement.

"So, the war with the home country has already started, huh? But please don't think of us as any other Imperial Knight." As he said himself, he seemed to be hiding an extraordinary ability.

"Enough chitchat. I'll kill you quickly."

Jiwu also wore a unique suit of armor. Although similar in design, it was jet-black in color and had a sheen like stars floating in the darkness.

![full page image](image11)

They might be legendary-grade, but the performance seemed to be as close to mythical-grade as possible.

The same was true for Bernie. The color of his armor was gold, but the performance seemed to be equal to those of Jiwu's. It was safe to assume that the wearer's ability was also reflected in the armor.

"Jiwu...you think that way of me too?"

Masayuki asked sadly, and Jiwu looked at him with cold eyes.

"Of course. I was just protecting you because that was my mission."

A simple statement. There was no further meaning in it. I could see how much Masayuki was hurt by it. I wanted to comfort him, but I could not do so now.

"Benimaru, be careful! He is strong. He has an Ultimate Skill for sure."

"Ultimate Skill? Is that the ultimate beyond a Unique Skill? Can it be managed with hard work and perseverance?"

"Impossible. To be honest, I don't think you can win."

"Good grief, to be told that with such certainty by Rimuru-sama, I'm more depressed than I thought." Benimaru only laughed at me when I told him so calmly. His expression seemed to be relaxed, so perhaps he had a plan.

An Ultimate Skill was the only way to defeat another Ultimate Skill. I didn't think that we could overturn this absolute law, but we were also in the labyrinth. I decided to leave things to Benimaru, since he would not die even in case of death.

The same went for Chloe.

Chloe was the strongest hero in the world.

Even without her Ultimate Skill, she had overwhelmed even Veldora. Well, it was not Chloe, but Chronoa who was out of control, but still, her fighting ability was tremendous.

And now that she had the Ultimate Skill 'Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth', I didn't think she could be defeated by Jiwu. If there was any concern, it was whether she could control the power of 'Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth' or not.

And so, I ordered Wisdom King Raphael-san to make sure.

![break]

<<Understood. Beginning analysis of the enemy's Skill.>>

![break]

Do you think that will work?

In any case, I decided to watch the battle going on, ready to help at any time.

![soft scene break]

Bernie was the first to make a move. He gripped the pendant and put his strength into it again. The shape of the pendant changed, and it became fixed in the form of a spear.

"I've never shown you this before, but I'm good at spearplay," he said. "I will show you this as a souvenir."

Bernie spoke with a superior attitude, and then he dropped to his haunches and braced himself for a tricky moment. Then he cast a spell without chanting, and the spear was covered with magic.

The magic he invoked was Thunder Rain. It was supposed to be a ranged attack, but all of its energy was focused on the spear.

It was quite impressive, but not as threatening as expected.

Benimaru countered with his own sword, "Red Lotus", covered with 'black flame'. The crimson blade of the sword was covered with black flames, giving off a mysterious glimmer. It was also splendid. It was as if his commanding ability was just a bonus, and his spirit was as strong as that of a demon god.

They both moved at the same time.

I had thought Bernie was only a magician, but he was also a great spearman. He was quite strong, as he said so himself. But I was able to follow his movements with ease.

The only thing that bothered me was that 'Predict Future Attack' did not work. That meant...

![break]

<<Report. Individual Bernie's Skill is preventing any interference.>>

![break]

I knew it. The reason why we had lost sight of Jiwu was probably due to some kind of interference phenomenon.

Presumably, Bernie and Jiwu had the power to protect themselves from any interference. This was a great power... What was more interesting was what other powers they had.

Benimaru and Bernie are fighting an evenly matched battle.

Benimaru's face showed no sign of impatience, and he was able to compete with Bernie. On the other hand, Bernie looked a little irritated.

The difference in strength was Benimaru's advantage. Bernie had the advantage in terms of equipment performance. So, it was not so fun for Bernie, I guess.

"You're doing a good job."

"You're pretty disappointing."

Bernie's face was distorted by Benimaru's reply. Perhaps because his pride was aroused, he stared at Benimaru with eyes as if his parents had been killed.

"How dare you, monster," he said. "In that case, will you be able to say the same thing once you've eaten this?!"

Bernie shouted, and tried to get out of Benimaru's strike range with his spear circling. He was probably trying to make a distance between the two in an offensive and defensive move, and to land a killing blow.

However, Benimaru did not allow him to do so.

He seemed to have completely recognized Bernie's movement, and he closed the distance with ease.

It was just amazing.

I knew that Benimaru had been training in secret, but I never thought that he had grown so much...

In my opinion, Benimaru's skill was better than Hakurou's now. I had thought Albert was a great swordsman too, but Benimaru was definitely better than him. His control of the 'black flame' was also excellent. He did not let his power get the better of him, and treated it as his own.

The Unique Skill 'Generalissimo' seemed to give one the ability to control their own power completely.

I was honestly impressed.

I had asked Benimaru if Zegion was stronger than him, but looking at Benimaru now, it was hard to tell who was stronger. Depending on the situation, the goddess of victory might smile upon either of them.

"Amazing..."

"I'm telling you now, it's just suicide to fight against such strong people. And Rimuru-san is even stronger, you know? So, please refrain from doing anything reckless from now on."

"Wow, I understand, Masayuki-san."

Behind me, Jinrai and Masayuki were having such a conversation. They probably could not see Benimaru and Bernie. They would only see flashes of light. Well, I guess they could still see how great I was.

As for me, I had been using Covenant King Uriel's 'Absolute Defense'. However, this was a very hard job. Bernie's attacks were affected by his Ultimate Skill, and if I was not careful, he would be able to penetrate the 'Absolute Defense'.

I mean, it was not me but Wisdom King Raphael-san who was having a hard time.

The two behind me were not important, but the battle between Benimaru and the others was more important now.

It seemed like Bernie's secret move was one that couldn't be activated unless we kept our distance from him. He had been trying his best to push Benimaru away from him.

Benimaru remained cool and calm. He was calmly hunting down Bernie, and was beginning to wound him little by little.

It looked like Benimaru's victory was only a matter of time, but apparently that thought was naive.

Bernie's position was broken by the onslaught of Benimaru. Taking advantage of this moment, Benimaru slashed him with a sword covered with 'black flame'.

It was supposed to be a fatal blow, but Bernie only smirked.

"As I thought, you can't beat me!"

His expression was bright, as if he had been trapped in a corner for a long time only to have seen this coming---no, this situation was all in the palm of Bernie's hand.

It was obvious what had happened.

An Ultimate Skill could only be countered by another Ultimate Skill---before this absolute law, Benimaru's attack was nullified.

In contrast to Bernie who was proud of his victory, Benimaru's face was distorted in frustration. He must have thought that even if his Unique Skill did not work, his swordsmanship would work.

However, reality was cruel.

Benimaru's sword did reach Bernie, but it was also blocked by Bernie's armor and did not result in a fatal wound. Moreover, Bernie immediately healed his wound by using restoration magic.

In this situation, the only way for Benimaru to win the game was to make a killing blow. Although Benimaru was a better swordsman than Bernie, Bernie was a fighter with an Ultimate Skill. It was an extremely difficult task against a superior player.

Benimaru was in a difficult situation. From this point, the tide of the battle turned to Bernie, and Benimaru was on the defensive.

![soft scene break]

Benimaru was in a tight spot. Chloe was also having an unexpectedly difficult time. She was far superior to Benimaru in a simple comparison of their abilities. However, Jiwu's forte was attacking at key points and breakthroughs, and she did not intend to engage Chloe in a head-on swordfight. She tried to create a situation in which she could gain an advantage by putting up Isolation barriers to prevent her from calling for support, or by creating a toxic fog that would cause darkness to blind her.

Such tricks would not work on the masked Chloe. However, even Chloe had difficulty in catching Jiwu, who kept running away.

Jiwu was running away, and Chloe was chasing after her.

The result was the prolongation of the battle.

Well, unlike Benimaru, Chloe had an Ultimate Skill. Since she had more skills than me, I did not think she would lose to Jiwu by any chance.

I had not paid attention to Chloe because I thought she would be safe, but it seems that things were not so easy as they seemed. At the same time that Benimaru was on the defensive, Chloe was also in trouble.

"How can you run away so easily?"

"Of course I can. Your sword is dangerous. I might penetrate even my own defenses."

Jiwu was cautious.

She was calmly dealing with the unknown opponent Chloe.

Chloe's 'Absolute Severance' was a Unique Skill, but somehow it was as powerful as an Ultimate Skill. Jiwu may have had some modesty in her words, but at least it was true that legendary-grade armor could not protect against Chloe's 'Absolute Severance'.

After all, even Veldora had been damaged, so one could say that Jiwu's choice was correct.

"You can't beat me if you keep running away, can you?"

"I don't deny your words. But it doesn't matter. My goal is not to win but to cover for Bernie. If Bernie kills that ogre, then we'll both kill you."

I couldn't keep quiet after hearing such a statement, but that was when Jiwu's sarcasm really kicked in. Every time I tried to join, she launched an attack on Labyrinth City.

Behind Masayuki and the others, there was an isolated town. There was no telling how much damage they would do if they attacked there.

Jiwu even asked Bernie for assistance.

"Bernie, we have an unexpected interloper. This woman is more trouble than she seems. It's dangerous to deal with her and Demon Lord Rimuru at the same time, so we need to play it safe. Help attack Labyrinth City to avoid her intervention."

"Understood. I'll help you as I see fit."

With the addition of Bernie's attack, my workload doubled.

Masayuki and Jinrai had the Resurrection Bracelets, so I was prepared for the worst. However, Labyrinth City was home to people who didn't know anything about all this.

Moreover, this was the safest place and not all of them were wearing the Resurrection Bracelets. Adventurers who were evacuating the city were, but not the ordinary residents.

In addition to preventing stray bullets, we had to deal with the harassment of Jiwu and Bernie. They were emission type attacks, so 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' could do the trick, but I couldn't help Chloe anymore.

No, seriously.

To be honest, it was a big help that Chloe had noticed and come to help me. If it had been just me and Benimaru, we might have already lost the battle.

After all, Benimaru could only parry Bernie's attacks. It was also difficult for him to interfere with the attacks on "Labyrinth City" because he might be defeated by the power of the attack if he was not careful.

The reason why the battle was still going on was that Benimaru's sword skills were higher than those of Bernie's.

Benimaru was coolly defending himself against the onslaught, in which even a single direct hit would kill him. Benimaru should be praised for his ability, though the situation was reversed by the superiority of Skills.

Even so...

I had thought that these guys were just lackeys of Masayuki's, but they had some great abilities hidden in them.

On the other hand, the fact that they had been deceiving my eyes until now showed me just how good they really were.

Luminas, too, had missed them at the festival. No wonder I, or rather Wisdom King Raphael-san, didn't notice them.

In any case, things were at their worst now.

The Telepathy Net' with Ramiris had been sabotaged, so we would have to get through this difficult situation on our own.

Perhaps sensing my anxiety, Chloe took a gamble. And it was this that led to an unexpected blunder.

"Now that it's come to this, I'm going to use my secret technique..."

If there really was a way out of this situation, I would have liked to ask for it. But for some reason, I had a bad premonition in that moment.

For a moment, the world seemed to go dark.

All movements stopped, and I felt as if my whole body was in a state of fixation.

I felt as if I had experienced this feeling somewhere else, without understanding what had happened.

That right, this was the same feeling I had gotten when Guy and Chloe first clashed.

![break]

<<Report. Individual Chloe Aubert's energy has decreased. It seems that she failed to control her Skill.>>

![break]

At the same time, I remembered that it was the same feeling I had when I was stopped in time. Wisdom King Raphael-san had issued a warning to me. Then I noticed that Chloe had turned back into a child.

"Hey, Chloe!"

"Darn! This power is too inefficient for me to handle right now..."

<I told you! It's hard to control it for a long time.>

It was not clear what had happened, but it was certain that Chloe's stunt had definitely failed. Worst of all, Chloe's ability to fight had also fallen apart.

It seems that even Chloe could not completely control the power of the 'Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth'. In the previous fight against Guy, she seemed to have mastered the power of 'Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth'. In reality, however, it was mostly Guy's power, and Chloe had only responded to it.

Still, it was impressive enough. If she had not been able to move in that time-stopped world, she would have been defeated unilaterally by Guy.

However, there was a large difference between a mock battle and a real battle.

Even though Chloe could stop time for a moment, it seemed to consume a lot of energy. The current situation was the proof of it.

This danger was the reason why it was a problem to use unidentified powers on the spur of the moment.

It would be a different story if Chloe could control the power of 'Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth' completely, but even Wisdom King Raphael-san had not finished its analysis yet, so it would be a mistake to expect such a miracle.

<Hey, Chloe! Are you okay?>

<The situation is a little tough. I can get back to my normal state, but it might take a while before I can get back to my normal state...>

I asked her in 'Telepathy Net' with concern, to which she replied regretfully. Still, the situation was not the worst. I was relieved that Chloe had not lost her ability to fight.

"I don't know what you were trying to do, but it was a futile attempt. You can't even grasp your own power. You do things more haphazardly than I thought."

"Hahaha, that's how it is. Jiwu, it just you who is being too cautious."

Seeing Chloe's failure, Jiwu and Bernie began to laugh.

But at that moment, a voice from heaven echoed in my mind.

![break]

<<Report. Analysis of enemy-owned skill is completed.>>

![break]

That was fast!

Chloe's 'Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth' had not been analyzed yet. I didn't think it would be so easy to analyze Bernie's Ultimate Skill.

I was hoping to find out the rough idea of their skills at most, but this was a pleasant miscalculation.

So, what are the contents?

![break]

<<Report. Regarding the skills owned by individual Bernie and individual Jiwu, many common points were confirmed. These are considered to be almost identical. A Unique Skill is one that emerges from individuality, and an Ultimate Skill is the one that goes beyond the limit of Unique Skill. Nevertheless, the similarity of the two skills means that--->>

![break]

Are you saying that Bernie's power is borrowed from someone else?

![break]

<<Affirmative.>>

![break]

I see.

Actually, I was thinking that it was a bit unnatural, too.

To acquire an Ultimate Skill, you can't get one by normal half-hearted efforts. Even Hinata was still at the unique level, and even transcendent people like Granbell and Luminas had not reached the Ultimate Skill level.

I felt bad to say this, but it was not such a simple power that Bernie or Jiwu could easily obtain.

Plus, the Ultimate Skill was indicative its owner's unique characteristics. The interference and concealment abilities were excellent, but no other powers were used.

I was wary, thinking that there was something hidden, but it seems that this was not the case.

![break]

<<Affirmative. Absolute superiority over magic and Unique Skills, and the complete concealment of his own abilities. These two points are the abilities lent to individual Bernie and the individual Jiwu. Even if the energy of both are backwards calculated, there is no room for them to exercise any more power.>>

![break]

Then was it correct to say that this was the only way they're going to use it?

One never knew how things would turn out until it was over. I thought so deeply as I saw Bernie and the others laughing.

<Benimaru! Chloe! I have found out the secret of their power. They are tough opponents, but they are not impossible to beat. I have a proposition for that, will you listen to me?>

I asked the two of them and they nodded in agreement.

<Of course. If I could cut him with my Red Lotus, we would have won already. What's annoying is that his power is specialized for defense.>

Benimaru seemed to be determined to continue the fight all the way to the end so that he would not lose. He looked for a chance to win without being deceived by his opponent's words and actions. In the meantime, Diablo and Shion would come back, and he would counterattack.

As expected of the "Samurai general"---a calm and dependable man at any time.

<I believe in Rimuru-san, too. I want to make up for this failure, and if you have a plan to win, just tell me!>

Chloe also believed in me.

Unlike Benimaru, she could have won this battle if she had not been in a hurry. If she had used 'Absolute Severance', she could have penetrated Jiwu's defense, and would not have lost to her in a one-on-one fight.

However, this situation was a good lesson for her.

Chloe's lack of familiarity with the Ultimate Skill was revealed, but that was something she could improve on from now on. I would look forward to the future and concentrate on finishing this battle for now.

<Then I'll tell you. Benimaru, I want you to connect with me through a Soul Corridor. If you do so, I can lend you a part of my power.>

<That's just what I want. It is better than losing, although asking for Rimuru-sama's help feels unhelpful. I promise you that we will win.>

Benimaru readily agreed.

It was a choice that was typical of Benimaru, who valued practical advantage over pride.

Besides, this time the enemy was using borrowed power, so there was no need to be ashamed of it. If we compared their abilities, Benimaru was definitely the better player.

Thinking as such, I gave 'Absolute Severance' to Benimaru's Red Lotus. This was as powerful as the one Chloe was using. It was just a reversal of 'Absolute Defense', so if both of them collided with each other, they would cancel each other out, but against Bernie, it should work well enough.

Benimaru was all set.

Next was Chloe.

<Chloe, Chronoa, listen to me. If you can buy some time, Benimaru will defeat Bernie. After that, Jiwu will be--->

This time, the pattern was reversed.

Now that Chloe was back to her adult form, she was far from her full potential. We should play it safe here and aim for a sure victory.

Chloe could just buy time for Benimaru to win. That's what I thought.

<Wait a minute! I haven't lost. I'm sure I can beat her one-on-one.>

<Yes, Rimuru, the 'Spacetime King' got us in trouble earlier, but if we fight seriously, we won't lose.>

The two of them were highly motivated.

I was not surprised because I had expected them to say that. So, I decided to make a proposal.

<Well, then I have one condition.>

<What is it?>

<Use the 'Spacetime King' again and win it outright.>

<Huh?>

<You can stop time for a short time, but that was too short for Jiwu, wasn't it?>

Chloe seemed to have mastered the Skill as long as she didn't do anything reckless. I didn't know how long that short time was, but I guess it was not enough time to catch up with Jiwu who had an Ultimate Skill.

So, she must have exceeded the limit, but perhaps the next time it would be fine.

<I'll help you. I'll help you with the calculation, so let's try again.>

<If that's the case, I'm not complaining...>

<Rimuru's going to free up the computing space, isn't he? If so, I think I can control it.>

Chloe and Chronoa agreed to my offer.

They looked worried, but the truth was, I felt the same way.

After all, this was a proposal from Wisdom King Raphael-san.

I wondered if it would be okay, but I believed in Wisdom King Raphael-san.

I guess it has some kind of intention, but I was going to trust it and take action.

Then Chronoa raised a question to me.

<But I don't have enough energy. I can enter into a combat form, but I haven't recovered enough energy to stop time. Even if Rimuru's help will increase the energy efficiency, Chloe won't be able to use it well now.>

That's what I was wondering about too.

I know you are planning to lend help, but will it be enough?

![break]

<<Affirmative. No problem.>>

![break]

That was a confident reply.

It must have something in mind, so I'd stop asking for details.

<There's no problem. If you need more, I'll provide it.>

Wisdom King Raphael-san was the one who was preparing it, though. Well, it's not something I would have to explain here, so I just made it sound good.

Hearing my reply, Chronoa agreed with me.

<I understand. Then I agree with you. Let's show here what we got.>

And so, the plan was set.

The counterattack would begin.

![soft scene break]

Benimaru changed his offensive style. He had been fighting with a "still sword" style, but as soon as I gave him 'Absolute Severance', he changed to a "dynamic sword" style.

The "still sword" is a sword technique in which the opponent made the first move, and the main focus was on counterattacks. The basic concept of the kata was to unite offense and defense, with emphasis on blocking and no aggressive attacks.

On the other hand, "dynamic sword" emphasized offense more than defense. The essence of this style was to overwhelm the opponent by attacking in a single bound, without giving up the initiative.

Bernie was surprised at the change of Benimaru's swordsmanship, and he was on the defensive. His position was reversed, but at that moment, he looked relaxed.

However, the moment of calm disappeared in an instant.

Bernie's composure was based on his proven confidence that Benimaru's sword would not work against him. However, that was already a thing of the past.

Bernie was late in dealing with Benimaru's fierce attack, and an opening arose. Benimaru aimed for a fatal blow in that moment.

![full page image](image12)

"Hagh!"

How could he---Was that what he was trying to say?

Bernie's torso was sliced in two by the blow. Then immediately after, he was cut in half from the head by a swift blow. Therefore, he died without saying his last words.

Benimaru's strength was overwhelming.

"If you had kept that momentum from the beginning, wouldn't you have won the battle by a comfortable margin?"

"No, if I had done that, my Red Lotus would have been broken. I thought that armor was dangerous, so I continued to fight in a way that I was not used to so as not to put a burden on my sword."

So that was it. He looked so imposing, but it is true that "Dynamic Sword" style suited Benimaru better.

And the Benimaru now was stronger than Hakurou for sure. His physical ability was superior to Hakurou's, but now even his skills were the same if not better. Benimaru was very strong once he really got into the game. In less than a minute from the start of the counterattack, he had defeated Bernie.

And Chloe was no less.

<I knew it, I don't have enough energy!>

Chronoa shouted in anguish as she tried to activate her ability.

But right after that...

![break]

<<Report. No problem.>>

![break]

In addition to the calm voice, there was another distressed voice saying, "Gywaaahhh!" at the same time.

I wonder what happened.

I guess it was that person's scream, but...

Even I felt bad after hearing it.

It's so pathetic.

I know it's not my fault, but I was still the cause.

So then, isn't it still my fault?

I vowed to treat him to a pudding next time, to apologize and to put him in a good mood.

In any case, the energy problem was solved.

The next moment, the world stopped...

And Jiwu was reduced to dust.

![break]

Well, that's how Bernie and Jiwu were defeated, and then came the report from Wisdom King Raphael-san in an apologetic voice.

![break]

<<Notice. Confirmed that the individual Bernie and the individual Jiwu are still alive. The existence of the Resurrection Bracelet was forgotten.>>

![break]

Uh...excuse me?

It was rare that Wisdom King Raphael-san made a mistake. Well, when I think about it, it's not too much to say that it was the first time, but it was still quite a rare occurrence.

"Oh no, we should have broken Bernie's Resurrection Bracelet."

"No, they weren't wearing a bracelet."

"Yeah. I was looking too, but I didn't see anything like that."

Oops, unlike me, Benimaru and Chloe were very careful. They remembered the existence of the bracelet and had fought while checking for them.

Or maybe it was me who was too careless.

I didn't think Wisdom King Raphael-san overlooked it, so I guess Bernie and the others were just better than us.

"Oh, about that..."

Masayuki, who had been observing the event for a long time, interrupted our conversation. Jinrai took over Masayuki's comment.

"Actually, we didn't accept your bracelet because we thought you were our enemy. But that doesn't mean we wouldn't use it..."

Saying that, Jinrai turned up the hem of his pants to show us. There, to our surprise, was a bracelet around his ankle.

"This is a bracelet...?"

"No, I know it's a bracelet. But it's a magic item, right? That's why it works as well as if I wear it here. Bernie said we should do this as a form of defiance."

Apparently, Bernie had anticipated this situation and had even taken steps.

Benimaru was scratching his head and clicking his tongue, and Chloe was looking unhappy. They must have been boiling under those expressions.

I didn't think Wisdom King Raphael-san could have done anything else if this was the case.

Because the place was in isolated state from Jiwu's power, and the communication with Ramiris was blocked because of it. I thought it would have been difficult to explain the exact situation to Veldora, though they could have 'telepathically' communicated with each other.

Besides, considering the amount of work Wisdom King Raphael-san had to do, it was mind-boggling how much it would have had to do at the same time in parallel.

In order to give 'Absolute Severance' to Benimaru, I had been working with Chloe (Chronoa) on the 'Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth'. A simultaneous control challenge. On top than that, there was maintaining my 'Absolute Defense', analyzing Bernie's abilities, and the list went on and on.

Under the circumstances, it was hard to expect that anyone would be stupid enough to put a bracelet on their leg.

"I guess it was inevitable. It can't be helped."

"Right. Let's forget about it. We've seen what they can do, and we'll beat them next time. Although they might send someone else, I'm sure we'll find a way to deal with them."

Benimaru and I decided to forget about this incident.

![soft scene break]

And just like that, Bernie and Jiwu were repelled.

It was my fault that I couldn't finish them off, but I decided to forget about it, so I didn't care.

Masayuki and the others were still shocked at the betrayal of their friends, but I believed that they would recover from it. I thought about that as I watched them slinking back to the hotel.

The battle was still going on. I felt sorry for Masayuki and his friends, but I didn't have time to worry about them.

I left Chloe in charge of Masayuki and the others, and Benimaru and I returned to the Control Room.

This time, all the enemies in the labyrinth should have been defeated. Just when we thought that all we had to do was to watch the final battle, we found that there were a few people in the room ahead of us.

"Ah, Rimuru! You gave us a scare when we suddenly lost contact with you!"

"That's right. Well, I wasn't worried about it, but I thought I'd still say something to you. Besides, Ramiris insisted. I'm not in a hurry---I just came to see how things were going."

Ramiris looked worried and Veldora looked pompous.

They complained to me that I should stop taking away their magicules so suddenly, but it was obvious that they were actually really worried about me.

I loved this kind of thing, these guys.

So then, Wisdom King Raphael-san, let's at least ask for permission before ever asking for Veldora's power.

![break]

<<...? It's too late for that. No problem.>>

![break]

What do you mean it's too late...

Could it be that it had been using it as they pleased without telling me?

Veldora seemed to have gotten used to it too.

If so, I felt bad for Veldora. I would prepare not only tasty snacks but also a new comic book for him.

"I'm sorry I worried you. But Veldora can contact me from anywhere, if you ever need anything."

"Is that so? Master?"

"Ah! Ahem. I told you there was no need to worry!"

Ramiris looked at him with a cold stare.

Perhaps embarrassed, Veldora changed the subject in a pompous manner.

"More importantly," he said, "If you're all right, why don't you hear what they have to say?"

I followed Veldora's gaze and saw Treyni-san, Souei, and a suspicious man wrapped up in a coil.

I had noticed the presence of Souei and the others, but who was the other one?

Treyni-san looked exhausted and was drinking fruit juice. She seemed to have enough time to spare, so I left her alone. I looked at Souei and asked him.

"Actually, I went straight to the place Moss told me about, and this man who was fighting with Treyni-dono was Laplace, our enemy."

It was Laplace who was wrapped up in a coil. He was beaten up pretty severely, but at least he was alive.

"Why is he still alive?" Benimaru asked Souei in a cold voice. It was rare, but his murderous intent was obvious.

"I was going to kill him too, but he insisted that he had something he had to tell Rimuru-sama."

"Of course it must be a trap!" Saying this, Benimaru drew his sword.

At that moment, Laplace, who had been lying limp, jumped up like a caterpillar. I thought to myself that he was very dexterous, but at the same time, I was a little amused.

"Hahaha!" I seemed to have been laughing uncontrollably.

"Hey, wait a minute! Don't just laugh at me---stop your men!"

"You dare---!"

Souei's fury was fierce. Benimaru tried to cut down Laplace without saying a word. I rushed to intervene and calm Benimaru's anger for the time being.

"Calm down. We're in the middle of a truce with Yuuki, aren't we? Now that we've brought him here, let's listen to what he has to say."

Souei nodded at my words. Souei was very patient and calm, keeping his moral principles in spite of his temper. Benimaru also admitted his fault and sheathed his sword.

"So, what's the story?"

"This is really a scary place. That sister there didn't listen to me and she was much stronger from when we met before. That big brother was a little better, but he doesn't have a single smile in his eyes. And that one over there..."

"Hah?"

Benimaru-san...you're revealing your hidden nature...

I coughed and changed the flow of the conversation, which was about to turn serious.

"Actually, Yuuki-san asked me to deliver a message!"

Laplace could read the air too. He looked at me appreciatively and started to talk about the reason why he came here. I listened to him, wishing I had done so from the beginning.

"That's why, watch out for Bernie and Jiwu!"

"..."

"..."

Benimaru and I looked at each other in silence.

I wish I had heard about that earlier.

Laplace told me that there was a man named Damrada who worked for Yuuki. He was one of the heads of the secret society "Cerberus" under Yuuki's control, and after receiving advice from Gadra and reviewing the story, Damrada was suspected to have tried to assassinate Gadra.

Of course, Yuuki did not give such an order. The suspicion was directed towards Damrada. Although it was a suspicion, it was practically a definite one. Yuuki, who had made such a judgment, reviewed his past actions on the assumption that he was correct. He found various suspicious points.

He suspected that Masayuki's associates arranged by Damrada might have some sort of secret. In a panic, Laplace, who had been returning from another mission, was assigned to be the messenger...

As Laplace's story progressed, Treyni-san's complexion became worse and worse.

"Why didn't you tell me earlier?"

"Well, you're going to have to explain that to me!"

"That's why I tried to tell you so many times that it was important! But you just said, 'how can I trust you?' And you wouldn't listen to me!"

"That's because you're a suspicious person. Besides, I have a bitter memory of you slipping away before and I was determined not to make such a mistake this time..."

"You're way too determined! I shouted so many times that I was serious this time because it was my job, but you only said, 'Shut up, no questions asked!' You didn't listen to me!"

The answer was obvious when I saw the two of them having such an ugly argument in front of me.

"So, have you guys been fighting all this time?"

"Yes. I hope you don't mind..."

Laplace was sulking. They said they had been fighting for a while now, not just a few days---maybe ten days?

No wonder he was sulking.

"I'm so, so sorry!" Treyni-san realized her mistake and apologized to me with a red face.

But who among us could blame Treyni-san?

We should have more trust in Laplace---but that was not easy to say.

Because even now he was still suspicious.

I didn't think we should judge people by their looks, but in this case, he had been acting suspiciously. The problem was that we needed to trust such a suspicious person.

I couldn't blame Treyni-san even though she had failed this time.

Benimaru couldn't complain either since he had about to slice him up himself. Souei looked uncomfortable too, and I was rather grateful to him for putting up with me and bringing him all the way here.

"Well, it's all over either way. Let's stop worrying about it and let bygones be bygones."

It was too late for this, and too much trouble to even think about it. So in that case, let's just cover it up for the time being.

The battlefield was more important right now.

We do not know what would happen until the end. With this in mind, we turned our eyes to the big screen.

![hard scene break]

Calgurio was frustrated and was waiting for a report. It had already been two days since he had dispatched a hundred of his best men to the labyrinth. He could not hide his dissatisfaction with the fact that he had not heard from them since then.

No, it wasn't just that.

Calgurio's heart was filled with anxiety.

Dazzled by money and high quality "magic crystals", he had decided to attack the labyrinth. He has no regrets about that. To keep the safety of the army's rear, he could not ignore the demon lord's territory.

The treasures obtained were more than expected, and Calgurio was pleased to see them brought out from the labyrinth. Now that he realized this, he was angry at his own inadequacy. At the same time, Calgurio was beginning to fear that he would be defeated by Demon Lord Rimuru with no way to recover from this situation.

"Damn it! Really, is there no report yet?" Calgurio shouted for the first time that day. No one in the staff answered him, but at that moment, a murmur could be heard from outside the camp.

"What's wrong? What happened?"

As if to answer Calgurio's question, a low-ranking soldier rushed in.

"Sir! A member of the 'Magic Tank Division' has just joined us!"

'What?' Calgurio thought.

Even if the performance of the magic tanks were superior, it was impossible that no sound of driving could be heard until they joined the division.

Since the messenger had never come back, the war situation of their comrades remained unknown. Considering this point, his bad feeling was only getting worse.

Calgurio's fears came true.

"I'm back now..."

Upon saying these words, a beautiful female officer, who did not look like she belonged on the battlefield, entered the field tent where Calgurio was staying.

It was Misha who represented 'Women', one of the heads of the secret society "Cerberus". She had been engaged in the Calgurio interception operation under Yuuki's orders, and she was engaged in this operation as well.

However, her position as a general staff officer of the Imperial Armored Corps was real. She served Calgurio as a staff officer of the Imperial Armored Corps, showing a certain level of competence.

However, Misha was assigned to the 'Magic Tank Division' this time, not to the main unit. Calgurio had assigned Misha to the 'Magic Tank Division' for safety reasons.

Misha, whose objective was to monitor Calgurio's movements, was honestly dissatisfied with this decision. However, she was not in a position to interfere, and she gave Yuuki a status report while pretending to be grateful for Calgurio's goodwill.

Naturally, she also reported the defeat of the 'Magic Tank Division'. After that, she carefully left the battlefield without being detected by the monsters, and thus joined up with the main group.

"Misha, you are safe!"

"Yes, Calgurio-sama."

Misha smiled bewitchingly. Even in her dirty clothes, there was no sign of a shadow on her good looks.

Calgurio was relieved to see Misha like this, but he had not forgotten his part.

"So, what about the others? How soon can we join with the main group?" he asked in rapid succession.

"Please wait, sir. There is nothing we can do in a hurry."

"What? What does that mean?"

"We've been wiped out."

"What?"

"The 'Magic Tank Division', the pride of the Empire, and a hundred of its tiger airships, have all been reduced to ashes." Misha told Calgurio with a bewitching smile.

"You...What the hell are you talking about?" Calgurio laughed in disbelief, but Misha remained silent. Seeing this, Calgurio had no choice but to believe her.

"Are you sure, they're all gone?"

"Yes."

"So, you're saying that the only survivors of the Armored Corps are the ones here?"

"That is correct, sir."

Hearing Misha's reply, Calgurio hung his head. Not just Calgurio, but also the rest of the staff members had a pallid look on their faces. The invasion had been a complete failure. Even if they had succeeded in conquering the labyrinth, there was no way to escape being held accountable for the loss of so many lives.

Emperor Rudra would never forgive them.

"What should we do?" Calgurio's mutterings were not answered by his advisors.

And then, Misha spoke up.

"We should leave."

"What?"

"I have glimpsed that you have not been able to capture the labyrinth. The labyrinth is to be explored, it is not to be invaded by an army."

"Is that what Yuuki said?"

"Yes. He said that only the best should be sent to conquer the labyrinth."

"Nonsense! We were sending our best!" Calgurio shouted back at Misha, now furious.

Calgurio was right. In fact, they had just sent in the best force they could think of two days ago. And he had sent the best of the Augmented Legion, the most powerful of the Imperial Guard, totaling to more than 500,000 men. To ask for more would be asking too much. He was sure that they would meet up with each other in the labyrinth. And even now, they must be marching to conquer the labyrinth.

Calgurio believed so. If he did not believe so, his heart would have been filled with fear.

Then Calgurio received the unrelenting words of Misha.

"But the labyrinth is still alive and well, even though it has swallowed up the best of our army. Indeed, it is possible that the battle is still going on inside. But we can't find out what's going on and it's hard to send any more reinforcements, isn't it?"

"Shut up."

"All we can do is wait for our comrades to get out alive, right?"

"I said shut up! Don't worry, Misha. We're giving necklaces with reviving properties to the top ranks. If you wear the necklace, you will be resurrected outside the labyrinth even if you die. The fact that no one has come out of the labyrinth proves that we're on the right track!"

Calgurio understood that this was optimistic thinking. But as the general in charge of the whole army, he had no choice but to say so on this occasion.

However, Misha's pursuit was not over. Unlike the other general staff members, Misha had made Calgurio her captive. Misha was confident that he could do whatever she wanted him to do, even if she defied him here.

"But the revival effect of the necklace that was tried has not been confirmed yet, has it? Yuuki-sama says that if the bracelet is embodied by a Skill, it is impossible to restore (copy) it."

Calgurio could not help but be silent.

There was no way he could tell his subordinate that he was going to experiment on them and that they had to die to show it. Misha was right. He had sent his comrades in arms away before conducting the experiment.

The necklace was just an insurance policy in case of an emergency.

Calgurio understood this point.

Misha was right and he was wrong.

A corps leader was not a position based on strength alone. It was a position that could not be filled without strength, but it could neither be filled by an incompetent person who did not understand the situation.

However, Calgurio could not find it in himself to believe that there was a structure that remained unconquerable after more than 500,000 elite soldiers had invaded.

They were an unbelievable military force that could burn several large cities to ashes. Even in the worst-case scenario, he had thought they could escape by destroying the labyrinth...

And that wasn't all.

At this point, a large number of people had to have died. And if Calgurio abandoned his compatriots inside the labyrinth, his name would remain forever as the incompetent one who had caused this historic defeat.

His own army of nine hundred and forty thousand men now had less than two hundred thousand remaining. There was no way he could retreat from the situation as it was.

Calgurio now realized that he had underestimated the demon lord.

He saw only the Storm Dragon as a threat, with the Demon Lord Rimuru and his army simply as an enemy to be overrun. He did not recognize the enemy as one of whom they should have fought.

That was a fatal mistake.

However, it was still too early to give up. There was still hope for Calgurio in the form of Minits.

"Calm down. Major General Minits, the man I trust the most, has entered the labyrinth. I'm sure he will bring back some information. We will wait and see what happens..."

But Calgurio could not finish his sentence.

"No, we should leave now, Calgurio-dono."

A man suddenly entered the tent and advised him to do so without asking permission.

"Who the hell are you?" a staff general asked.

Calgurio looked at the man, wondering what the guards were doing.

The man looked healthy, but the blood on his uniform was disturbing. Since none of the men here were supposed to have been in the battle, it could be a survivor of a detachment, or it could be a man who had been killed in the battle.

"My name is Krishna. I am one of the hundred who entered the labyrinth two days ago, and I am ranked 17th in the Imperial Guardians' hierarchy."

Hearing these words, everyone present was astonished. And so was Calgurio.

"I-Imperial Guardians?"

"Why are the Imperial Guardians here?"

The staff members were agitated.

But, as it was, Calgurio was the first to regain his composure.

"Now is not the time! Krishna-dono, you say? Can you tell us what's going on first?" He gave a quick yell to calm the situation down. Krishna thanked him with a glance, and then hurriedly explained the situation.

"I shall tell you plainly. That labyrinth is dangerous. Bazin (Number 35) and Reicha (Number 94) are dead. Even Major General Minits was killed before my eyes. I'm not completely sure, but I believe that Colonel Kansas is dead as well. There are no survivors in the labyrinth. You can be sure of that!"

Everyone who listened to his words was stunned.

Calgurio wanted to shout out that this was a lie, but Krishna's eyes were serious. His whole body was telling him that what he was saying was true.

To begin with, his face was familiar. Calgurio remembered that Krishna was indeed one of the people he had sent out two days before.

*So he had come back to life. He had the Resurrection Bracelet. Not a replica, but the real one. If so, we can be sure that he is the real one.*

Calgurio, in spite of his desire lash out, tried to think calmly.

There were two "Resurrection Bracelets" submitted by Gadra.

One was being analyzed by the technology department for the production of a replica. The other was presented to the emperor. Probably because of the loan of this "bracelet", Krishna had been able to revive.

This confirmed the revival effect of the Resurrection Bracelet, but it also confirmed that the duplicates were ineffective.

This meant that the generals in the labyrinth had been truly annihilated.

Calgurio paled as he realized that more than 500,000 soldiers had all died.

But now was not the time.

Krishna's explanation was not finished.

"And the guy who killed us wasn't even the demon lord or one of his Four Heavenly Kings. It was a majin whose name I've never heard. He was a member of the Elite Ten or something like that, but he was something else."

To begin with, the "Elite Ten" were capable of fighting as well as or better than the archdemons. Among such monsters, a majin who called himself Zegion boasted a strength from another dimension. He was so strong that he made Krishna realize that he could never win.

"Once again, let us retreat. This is no shame. Make the decision now to save the surviving generals!"

Krishna's passion made the soldiers cringe. His words were undoubtedly true. Everyone understood that there was no time to lose.

"...You said it was not the demon lord? That place was crawling with archdemon level monsters? Is it really that big? How can a demon lord who we thought was a newcomer have such a great power---?!" Calgurio exclaimed, as if he couldn't take it anymore.

This was the signal for the staff members to start making a commotion.

"Let's retreat now! This is not our fault alone. The negligence of the intelligence services are also to blame!"

"That's right. We must let those who are still alive escape before Demon Lord Rimuru makes his move!"

The soldiers were talking and expressing their own opinions. They usually quarreled with each other, but on this occasion, they were all in agreement. They instinctively realized that they were in danger.

Finally, Misha opened her mouth.

"I forgot to tell you that it was not the evil dragon Veldora that destroyed us. It was someone else's nuclear magic that dealt a fatal blow to our army. Twice. It was a magic on a scale that could easily defeat legion magic. The wielder of that magic is a threat, but I have another point to make. That is..."

No one needed to hear the end of it to understand.

Veldora, the Storm Dragon, was still waiting in this land.

Calgurio made the decision and gave the order.

"Gather the men! Move out! We're all going home now!"

Calgurio shouted as if telling himself that this was not a retreat, but a march. He knew that this was sophistry, but if he did not think as such, he was afraid that he would be crushed by anxiety. It did not matter if it was sophistry or not, as long as he could escape from this situation. The soldiers thought so as well and tried to obey the order immediately.

However, it was too late.

The situation had already begun to move. It became a raging current, a swirling torrent that swallowed up Calgurio and the others.

The fate of the imperial army---it had already been decided.

![soft scene break]

Calgurio's orders were countered by a low, clear voice from the tent.

"We can't have that. My lord has decreed that you shall not be allowed to retreat."

The man appeared with ease, as if to interrupt the flustered command center.

All eyes were drawn to the entrance of the tent. Standing there was a man in an exotic garb with a sword at his waist. His white hair, speckled with gold, was brushed back and tied up in a knot. He had a long white beard and a wrinkled face. However, his sharp eyes and straight, clean posture showed no signs of aging.

"Who are you?" Krishna asked, stepping forward.

"I beg your pardon. My name is Agera, sent by my lord Carrera-sama as a messenger on this occasion."

The man was Agera.

Rimuru was a pacifist, for better or for worse, so it was decided to send an emissary to the enemy in order to recommend surrender.

Few expected the Imperial Army to accept, and more felt saddened by the losing a chance to perform. However, Agera, one of the few who had common sense, began to argue that it was the custom of the warrior class, and Geld also approved. Momiji did not object to this, so he was ordered to come as an emissary.

This action was meant to buy time for the Tempest forces to get ready.

It did not matter whether the Imperial Army made a full stand or surrendered. However, they were not allowed to run away. All those who participated in this invasion would be punished. That was the decision that Rimuru had made.

Agera respected that decision. He had no intention of letting Calgurio and the others escape.

Then, one of the chief advisors spoke up to Agera.

"A messenger? You mean for Demon Lord Rimuru?"

Agera's expression turned grim for a moment.

"How arrogant you are to call our great lord Rimuru by his name! You should reflect on this matter in the afterlife."

As soon as he finished his words, the head of the soldier who had asked the question was lopped off.

Those present had not felt any sign that Agera had even drawn his sword. Even Krishna, who was closest to Agera, could not react at all.

With a single sword stroke, Agera took control of the scene.

While everyone else was silent, Agera delivered his demands in a clear and concise manner.

"I see you are ready to listen to me. In that case, I will tell you. Disarm and surrender immediately. You will be spared your lives as slaves. If you defy us, so be it. We will decide who wins in a show of valor. We will wait an hour. If you surrender, you have until then to make your decision."

With these words, Agera turned away.

Calgurio's brain began working frantically at this point to figure out what was best for him. Then, he decided to negotiate with Agera with a gleam of hope.

"Wait! No, excuse me. Please wait a moment."

"Yes?"

Agera stopped and turns to Calgurio.

"Excuse me, my name is Calgurio. I am the head of this legion and the chief of this operation."

"Hmm. So, what can I do for you?"

Agera was merely trying to buy time, so there was no hurry to rush back. He was not interested, but decided to listen to what Calgurio had to say anyway.

Upon seeing Agera's reaction, Calgurio put all hope for negotiations.

"Agera-dono, you said earlier that if we surrendered, you would accept us. Slavery is too outrageous. It is a condition that I cannot accept."

Calgurio's abrupt statement took the soldiers by surprise. However, no one there spoke out in opposition. They all understood the gravity of the situation and decided to put their hope in the future of this negotiation.

Taking advantage of Agera's silence, Calgurio continued speaking unilaterally.

"We can win this war without any more damage than if we were to fight as dead soldiers. Instead of making us slaves, won't you let us off the hook? Of course, we will pay you compensation, and we promise to refrain from any further invasions. No, that's not all! I wish to go back to my country and ask His Imperial Majesty for an alliance with your country! If the empire and your country join forces, it will be easy to rule the world. We will be in a superior position against other demon lords, and it would not be a bad thing for His Majesty Demon Lord Rimuru, would it? We will not forget the debt. What do you think? Can't you please contact His Majesty? I am sure he would be happy to hear from you."

Calgurio pleaded desperately.

Considering the current situation, the Dwargon and labyrinth attacks were completely lost. All of the soldiers involved in the operation were dead.

The only survivors were the less than 200,000 who were still here. By all accounts, this invasion had been a disaster.

Even Calgurio had no choice but to admit it. He wanted to return at least the survivors to their homeland in safety.

This matter, and only this matter, was a responsibility Calgurio could take on.

Calgurio finished what he had to say and waited for Agera's response.

Calgurio understood that this was wishful thinking, but the odds are not completely against them.

They were greatly reduced in number from the beginning, but a little less than 200,000 was still a large army. They would be as big as the demon lord's army in terms of numbers, and it would be no fun for Demon Lord Rimuru to be outnumbered by such a large number of dead soldiers.

On the ground, unlike in the labyrinth, death was final and they would not be brought back to life. Therefore, this proposal, which would give them a complete victory, would at least be worth considering.

At the very least, it was not the kind of proposal that Agera could simply respond to. It would surely be conveyed to Demon Lord Rimuru.

Once it was relayed to Demon Lord Rimuru, that was when the real work began. Even if it was unforgivable to let all of them go, they could negotiate to at least let some of them go.

If possible, he would do it.

*If he takes them into slavery, he will not take their lives. It is a lenient attitude, unlike most demon lords, but it might just help us this time. We can buy back the lower-ranked soldiers later. We must return to our home country and tell the situation to His Imperial Majesty at any cost.*

Calgurio thought so.

He valued his life. But more importantly than that, he wanted to save as many of his soldiers as possible. And the information had to be brought to the emperor at all costs.

That was Calgurio's true intention.

He had underestimated the enemy's strength too much. This was the reason for the defeat, but in a sense, this was an inevitable outcome.

Dwargon, Tempest, and the Western Nations. He was confident that even if they faced these three forces at the same time, they would be able to win with their great power this time.

They were confident of their victory, but the result was this.

It was impossible to imagine such a ridiculous story that Demon Lord Rimuru had several Disaster-class monsters under his control.

Calgurio's downfall was inevitable after this blunder, but any further loss of life could destroy even the very foundation of the empire. Calgurio should step down and bet on the future rebuilding of the empire, even if it meant abandoning his pride.

Calgurio was greedy, but he was not incompetent. That is why he offered up this proposal.

*If Demon Lord Rimuru desires my life, then so be it. Someone will surely bring back the information to His Majesty Rudra. Then our defeat will at least have some meaning...*

Calgurio went to the negotiating table, prepared to sacrifice himself.

But it was already too late.

"Do you really think you are in a position to give us conditions at this point? Your fate was decided the moment you refused Testarossa-sama's mercy. Resist or obey, and make your choice as you wish."

That was Agera's reply.

Agera left the tent with ease. No one was able to move.

The only words left at the end were "Don't even think about running away."

![break]

"What are you going to do?"

Misha asked Calgurio, who stood there stunned and without words.

There was a moment of silence...

"...We can only fight. All our lives belong to the emperor. Slavery may prolong our lives, but we cannot disgrace His Imperial Majesty by accepting such humiliation!"

Quietly and with determination, Calgurio made his decision.

"But we have neither magic tanks nor magic cancelers. It will be a tough fight, you know?"

"It will be fine. The objective is no longer survival but to bring back information to His Imperial Majesty! No matter how many generals we have to sacrifice, you alone must escape!"

"...?! Please wait!"

"So, what are you going to do then?"

"That goes without saying. I will show those monsters my pride as an Imperial soldier!"

Calgurio finally gave up his ego in the desperate situation. As a result, he regained his pride as a pure soldier.

Seeing Calgurio's changed mood, the faces of his lieutenants and staff members also changed.

"No one would be so shameless as to leave you alone and run away."

"That's right. Isn't it interesting, this last desperate attempt?"

"It is not yet decided that we will lose! This is where the Armored Corps really comes into its own!"

They were all talking in high spirits, and their morale was high.

Misha let out a sigh in the midst of this atmosphere.

"Well then, I'm going to get out of here. I don't have such an auspicious character that I would accompany your suicide."

It was like she was allowing herself to be hated, fluttering her hands in the air.

Calgurio laughed.

"I'm sorry. I'm sure you'll be fine if you have a connection with that Yuuki boy. Please inform His Imperial Majesty of my incompetence."

"Understood, my lord."

Misha returned a wry smile.

No one stopped Misha. No one could understand that her escape from this place would not be an easy one.

"You need someone to escort you..."

"Then we will take care of it."

Before Calgurio could finish, two figures appeared in the tent. It was Bernie and Jiwu, who had just escaped from the labyrinth.

"Single Digits!"

"Krishna, it's been a long time. You'll die if you stay here---Do you want to come with us?"

They were all stunned by his words.

'A Single Digit', the most powerful fighters in the empire, was speaking up in anticipation of defeat. This fact told them of the severity of the battle that awaited them.

"No. I want to stay with Calgurio-dono."

"I see. Then I promise to tell His Imperial Majesty about your exploits---your deaths will not be in vain. You will die with honor. Do your best. There will surely be a meaning in it."

Bernie's words echoed heavily, and Jiwu silently agreed.

They quickly withdrew from the scene, taking Misha with them.

Those who remained were prepared to die.

"It is not necessary to keep to the time specified by the messenger. We must strike with maximum force before the enemy forces are ready!"

Calgurio's order reached the end of the line in an instant. Everyone began to scramble to prepare for the final decisive battle.

![hard scene break]

"Well, I see they have chosen a decisive battle." Geld paid his respects to the imperial troops as they began to scurry about.

Their victory was not yet assured. On the contrary, they were heavily outnumbered. They must not let their guard down. They could not afford to lose any casualties against wounded tigers.

The Second Corps, led by Geld, was to be on the defensive. They were to hold the front line and protect the firepower units in the rear. If they did so, they would be able to win the war.

This was a tactic in which the dwarves excelled in. They would unleash their powerful offensive magic from inside the walled units.

It was a simple and clear tactic that suited Geld.

The Fourth Corps was in charge of firepower, but it was led by Momiji of the Tengu clan.

"Victory for my husband!" she encouraged the gathered members with a smile.

It was a very clever strategy to attack from the surroundings. Before one knew it, the moat would be filled and the enemy would be established.

Geld thought that Momiji might have Benimaru beat in the strategy aspect, though he was not be too far behind. If he really did not like it, he would have dealt with it long ago. Otherwise, the name of 'Generalissimo' would not add up.

The problem was that there were many women who admired Benimaru.

The most famous one was Alvis.

Her fierce competition with Momiji was famous among the executives. Whether Momiji would be the winner or not remained to be seen.

Alvis had come to support Momiji this time as well, and Geld was not sure which one to support.

*In this case, there will always be those who will be saddened. It is best not to get too deep into it.*

Geld came to an uncharacteristic conclusion. He changed his mind and once again checked for any deficiencies.

The support of the troops standing by in the rear was in perfect condition, and there were no problems with the means of attack. Not only the main force led by Momiji, but also the flank led by Shion, and the reinforcements led by Alvis were present.

As for the coordination, he had no worries as long as Benimaru was there.

*As long as I fulfill my role, we will not be defeated.*

Geld's defenses were ironclad.

The elite of the Yellow Numbers and Orange Numbers together numbered 17,000. These warriors were given iron-clad defense by Geld's Unique Skill 'Protector'. In addition, the armors forged by Kurobee and Garm strengthened the strength of Geld's warriors to the extent that they could withstand shells.

It was also a big advantage that Geld's Unique Skill 'Gourmet', Stomach, could be used by the whole corps. A few injuries could be healed by magic from the support troops in the rear, and even a serious injury could be healed immediately with the use of recovery medicine.

In case of emergency, Geld's 'Stomach' was always stocked with a large amount of recovery medicine. The Rimuru-produced restoratives were stockpiled not only for the current war, but for all contingencies.

The quality of the potions did not deteriorate, so they were ideal for preservation. This time, they were allowed to use them without hesitation.

Considering the concept of logistics, a unit that could replenish supplies on the spot without moving was extremely reliable. The monsters would function as a strong wall constructed by their own bodies.

'There is no way we could lose' Geld thought.

And then there was also...

Geld turned his gaze skyward.

There he saw the military officer "Carrera" assigned to Geld's unit.

![full page image](image13)

*Rimuru-sama is expectant of that power. I, for one, am looking forward to it.*

It wouldn't be long until he showdown. Geld was practically shaking with excitement, but quietly waited for the moment to come.

![hard scene break]

Ahead of Geld's line of sight, Carrera stood stationary in the sky above. She had been assigned to the Second Corps with two of her companions, but now they were separated.

Rimuru had given her the honor of the first attack.

Geld, a military man, had graciously accepted it and told her to do as she pleased. He was a very agreeable man, and Carrera knew she was in good company.

Carrera had also received secret orders from Rimuru to protect Geld. Probably, Testarossa and Ultima had received the same. If there was someone in the Imperial Army who was too strong for the leaders to deal with, Carrera and her group's real role was to buy time by dealing with that person.

But now things were different.

Now that she was in a position to take the lead, there was no reason for them to stay together. In fact, with Geld and the others playing the role of a wall, Carrera and the others had no place to play.

The first priority now was to think about how to destroy the enemy.

Therefore, Carrera intended to release nuclear magic from the sky.

"Wait a moment, please! Carrera-sama, just what are you going to do?"

Agera, who had just returned from his role as a messenger, rushed to stop Carrera. The cool-headedness he had just displayed against the imperial army was gone. In front of Carrera, Agera was just another struggling man.

Agera rushed back to the base after a bad premonition, but it seems that he was right. The way he sensed Carrera's presence and read Carrera's behavior; he had a good intuition as a hard worker who had been trained for a long time.

"Oh? Agera, are you back? I've been thinking about it a lot, and I think I need to practice. That way, I won't fail in the real thing!"

Carrera, who had been thinking of taking advantage of the absence of the noisemakers, did not seem to react at all to the interruption. This was a very clear evidence that this was a normal behavior.

"Practice, you say?"

"Yes, that's right. Just a nuclear explosion in the sky, a little bit like a big firework, right? The residual heat will fry the ground a little, but it'll be fun. What do you think? This should work, right?"

"Excellent, perfect! As expected of Carrera-sama!"

A girl standing by praised Carrera with a smug look on her face. That girl was Agera's equal partner---Esprit.

She had a lovely face, but her character was very bad. It was no exaggeration to say that she was the worst. Agera was also in a bind because of her strong ability.

Normally, one would share the same hardships with their colleagues. However, Esprit was useless, following Carrera's lead.

She never once scolded Carrera, but always acted according to Carrera's will. She was a vicious person who put Agera in an unfavorable role and acted as Carrera's cheerleader.

As a result, all the hardships came to Agera, creating quite the unpleasant environment.

Testarossa, who committed evil while maintaining reason, and Ultima, who pursued brutality, were also quite sickening. However, it was not a matter of being without malice.

Carrera, who always did her best without regard to the inconvenience to others, was also a troublesome lord from Agera's point of view.

It was not at all amusing to be laughed at for having caused a little too much damage. It was impossible for him to laugh with her.

On the other hand, his colleague Esprit seemed to have no trouble with Carrera because they shared the same sensibility. This fact made Agera feel very envious.

"Saying that it's perfect---! You shut your mouth!"

The hardworking Agera shouted at the irresponsible Esprit for the time being. Then he turned to Carrera and began to explain carefully as if he were talking to a child.

"Listen, Carrera-sama, I've just gone to the enemy camp as a messenger, haven't I?"

"Yes, that's right."

"That being the case, it is a rule on the battlefield not to interfere until the time is right."

"What? This is just a practice run."

"Even if it's practice, what is no good is no good!"

Carrera, Agera's boss, had the personality of a runaway car without brakes. It was very difficult to stop her. Her power was so overwhelming that it was hard to deal with her.

She had been inciting Demon Lord Leon on a regular basis. She shot nuclear magic every day and repeatedly provoked him. If it had been another demon lord, a war would have started long ago and Carrera would have wreaked havoc and ended up back in the demon world.

Carrera's purpose in life was momentary pleasure, so she did not care about victory or defeat in war. Therefore, even if she lost, she would just disappear with a big smile on her face.

Because she herself would not think she had lost, it would not do any damage and would not lead to any remorse. How could he teach Carrera common sense? This was Agera's big problem until a while ago.

But now things were different.

Until now, there was no one who could give an order to Agera and his comrades, who were the upper class of the most powerful demons, the ruling class. And against Carrera, who even had those ruling class of demons as her followers, it was a matter of risking one's life just to express an opinion to Carrera.

Agera was allowed to follow Carrera without being erased from existence only because Carrera liked him.

Now, however, Carrera had become a subordinate of the Demon Lord Rimuru.

Agera thought that in the future, it would be necessary to learn patience in order to make a good impression on Demon Lord Rimuru. She would have to use her head, not her intuition.

What he needed to do was to help his boss Carrera learn common sense.

In fact, Carrera had learned the laws and regulations, and had even been able to deal with them correctly. That being the case, Agera hoped that Carrera would think and act a little more in her daily life.

*If she does, it will ease my hardships a little, won't it?*

With such a modest wish in mind, Agera strove every day to persuade Carrera. Therefore, Agera took this opportunity to preach to Carrera on the points of issue.

On the outside, Agera looked like a grandfather who was scolding his granddaughter, but he didn't care about that. He continued his explanation believing that this was his chance.

His words were easy to understand and concise. This was very difficult for Carrera, who was easily bored and did not listen to others.

Agera explained to Carrera the customs of war in a very detailed manner.

But then...

Suddenly, the imperial army began to move.

"Hey, there's still a lot of time left before the time Agera-kun promised, isn't there?"

"Yes, indeed..."

"Then does that mean that while I was listening to Agera-kun's boring story, the Empire slipped by?"

Agera was nervous. It was due to two things.

Carrera was usually one to take things easy, but when she gets angry, she goes beyond outbursts and explodes. If Agera was the target of her anger, he would have to give up any hopes of survival.

The other was his anger towards the empire.

He had taught Carrera the rules of warfare, and now they had ruined them. Agera was angry for the first time in a long time at this betrayal of the empire.

"Carrera-sama! Let's leave the old man alone and educate those fools who can't even keep their promises!"

'You should be thankful, you fool!' said Esprit while she pointed at the imperial army to get Carrera's attention.

Geld and his men formed a line.

A controlled army of nearly 200,000 troops was closing in on them. From the air, they looked like nothing more than bait.

Carrera nodded her head smugly.

"Shall we do it? Agera, of course you won't stop me, right?"

She was asking a question with a fierce tone, as if she would kill him if he stopped her. However, Agera's reaction was different from what Carrera had expected.

"Indeed...I told them to wait for an hour, but I did not say that they should not attack until then. It seems that I am responsible for this mishap."

"And so?"

"It is part of a warrior's duty to intercede for those who wish to die. Do not go easy on them. I think you should do as you please."

Agera, too, was ready.

He was a gentle man, unlike most demons, but he hated it when his lord was mocked or when promises were broken. The empire had caught Agera's displeasure.

"I like it. How exciting. That's why I like you so much."

Agera was no longer restrained. Carrera noticed this and laughed with delight.

"Well then, let's begin. Let me show you what happens when they try to make fools of us!"

"Yes."

"Understood."

And so, the war began.

The empire did not know that their actions were tantamount to authorizing their own executions.

"Well then...let's make it rain nuclear magic, shall we?"

"That's a good idea! Explosions blooming on the ground, how wonderful!"

And then they learned...that if you provoke the meek...the retribution may result in the extreme.

"No, that's too lukewarm. Carrera-sama, I would like you to remember the words of our Lord. Didn't he say to 'use your flashy magic to knock the emperor's army's lights out'?"

"Hmm?"

"I believe that showing our full strength is the only way to comply with his wishes, my lord."

Carrera's eyes widened.

Agera's words were right on the money. And now, Agera himself, who always tried to stop Carrera's outbursts by making small complaints, was now telling Carrera to give it her all.

Carrera was deeply moved by this realization.

"You're right, Agera. Your words have woken me up. All right, let's show them what we've got! I'll show off the magic which I've never succeeded in doing before!"

Carrera was fully motivated.

Oh crap---only then, did Agera regained his composure, but now it was too late. Carrera had turned her attention to the magic.

Just what are you going to do?---Esprit stared at him, but Agera didn't know what to do. They would all just have to wait and see.

Even if Carrera went out of control and got in trouble later, they would only have time to think about it. He decided to just enjoy the situation.

Agera was still a demon, after all.

![break]

As a result, the imperial army, which had begun its march, was destroyed by an attack from the sky.

Multilayer Barriers by legion magic, anti-magic defense by state-of-the-art equipment, high resistance to magic of each individual, and many sacred blessings were all generously invested. All of these defensive measures became powerless in the face of Carrera's large-scale annihilation magic.

This magic is a kind of nuclear magic: Gravity Collapse.

This magic, which boasted the greatest and most powerful strength among all nuclear magic, required a huge amount of magicules and precise Magic Power Manipulation.

If the Abyssal Core, which was the key to the magic, was left unattended, it would expand and produce Nuclear Flame. Gravity Collapse was a forbidden magic formed by suppressing and compressing it.

What this compression meant was that a super gravity was created. To put it simply, one could say that she had created an artificial black hole.

The magnetic field of gravity of a star was disrupted, and a localized supergravity force field was generated there. All those who were caught within the sphere of influence of the limited super-compressed space would be crushed.

The fate of the imperial army exposed to such a magic was, needless to say, disastrous.

All of a sudden, gravity began increasing in power as if it had gone mad. The Imperial soldiers were crushed by the effects of the magic, unable to bear even their own weight.

The open clearing was a curse, and there was no way to escape the demon's eyes. More than 80 percent of the nearly 200,000-strong army was trapped within the magical sphere of influence.

The soldiers were now unable to move, but the real work of this magic was only just beginning. A storm of mana blew through the precisely designated area. It was an inverted tempest like no one had ever seen before.

The super-compressed space reached its breaking point, and soon all the energy was concentrated into a single point. Once it reversed, a small supernova appeared on the ground.

A jet-black pillar connecting the heavens and the earth---it seemed as if the gates of hell had been opened, with the dust and sediment that had been swept up to the stratosphere by the massive explosion.

This was no longer the level of magic to be used on a planet. If the area had not been specified, the entire Great Jura Forest would have been scorched.

There was no one in the imperial army strong enough to resist it.

That was only natural.

This nuclear magic 'Gravity Collapse' was an all-attribute attack that engulfed all magic and physical phenomena.

Thus, most of the Imperial Army disappeared into dust before even understanding what had happened.

Carrera was satisfied with that blow.

The troubled one was Agera, who had come to his senses.

Since he was the one who had encouraged her to do this, he could not complain. However, Agera never imagined that she would create such a disaster.

No, it was more correct to say that he had thought 'this might be bad', but still had no idea that Carrera's power was so great.

Even now he was still wondering what he should do, but it was too late now.

The hardships of the hard working Agera had only just begun.

![hard scene break]

'This is really something', Geld laughed. He had expected Carrera to be strong, but this strength was just unimaginable.

"I never thought she could obliterate so many enemies with a single blow. We will never get a chance to play a part in the battle." Geld complained in that way, but he did not mean it.

In spite of the confusion, there were more than 20,000 survivors of the Imperial Army. All of them were desperately trying to escape from the death zone and were coming towards Geld.

The numbers disadvantage had been overcome, but this was no time to be complacent. Geld knew this all too well.

The Imperial Army, seeing the fear of death in their eyes, would charge at them in a desperate attempt to kill them. That pressure was not half-baked.

However, Geld was unmoved.

Perhaps because of the calmness of their commander, all of Geld's men, down to the very end, were calm and focused on the enemy.

"Shields up!"

Geld gave a solemn order when there was only a short time left before the two armies made contact.

The Second Corps reacted with a single, unwavering movement. In the next instant, they formed a wall that no one could penetrate.

In spite of the fierce clash, Geld and his men did not retreat even a single step, and they caught the imperial troops. After that, Geld's wall never once collapsed, and they pushed back the imperial army without retreating a single step.

![break]

The final battle began, and the next move was made by Shion.

"Charge! Let us slaughter all the enemies of Rimuru-sama!"

Shion's guard, led by the "Yomigaeri," let out a shout as a signal. Immediately after that, as many as 10,000 majin of various kinds began to take action in their own way.

They were trained by Shion and claimed to be her fans. Led by the "Yomigaeri," they appeared to be united in their actions.

Their fighting ability was noteworthy, as was their number.

All of them had the Extra Skill 'Mortal Fear', which was a power of Shion, given through the Yomigaeri. Ten thousand majin turned into Terror Knights and attacked the imperial army.

They incited the enemy's fear and made them lose the will to fight. This was the essence of Extra Skill 'Mortal Fear'. The effect of this skill was enormous, because it blocked the true strength of the enemy forces and allowed them to unleash their own one-sided violence.

Wearing the matching navy-blue armor forged by Garm, the eldest of the three brothers, the Shion Guard rampaged on the battlefield. Their appearance was the stuff of nightmares for the imperial army.

The most eye-catching among them were the three giants, who released huge amounts of youki.

They had assimilated Shion's 'Mortal Fear' with their own youki, and were on the rampage as incarnations of violence.

They were, of course, the three sons of Demon Lord Dagruel.

The others were no different.

Taking full advantage of their death-resistance, the Yomigaeri caught the attention of their enemies. While in this situation, the other majin would take care of the enemy. By doing so, they steadily reduced the number of enemy forces without causing any damage.

Gobzo was one of them.

"Ah, my head is getting all mushy!"

He was calmly saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," but there was a hole in his head where he had been stabbed by a sword. It was a horrifying experience for those who were not used to it.

"That's Gobzo-san for you!"

"Yeah. That blow would have killed me."

Gobzo's subordinates were impressed by his growth.

In the meantime, three whirlpools were forming on the battlefield with Dagruel's sons at the center. With this as a starting point, the left side of the empire had begun to collapse. The imperial generals began to be pushed by the surging forces of Shion's guard, which did not miss them.

Even the Imperial Guard, in their desperation and in the heat of battle, were no match for Shion's Yomigaeri.

If they were comparing individual fighting abilities, there was not much difference in their capabilities. However, there was an overwhelming gap in the level of their skills, and the Yomigaeri were superior in terms of skills.

What kind of training was required to achieve this?

The members of the Yomigaeri showed an amazingly specialized combat performance.

Shion was very active on the right flank.

On the right side of the Imperial Army, there was also a turbulence.

"No...how?! How can there be---splat!"

"B-Beast Master's Warrior Alliance...?!"

"No, I don't want to die---agh!"

The Beast Master's Warrior Alliance and the majins under the Beast King had come as reinforcements. All of them were giving their all in order to repay Rimuru for his great favor.

"That's a true monster."

"Indeed."

At Alvis's muttering, the elephant beastman Zor nodded.

A great magic, the likes of which had never been seen or heard before, was unfolding before our eyes.

The pillar of horror connecting heaven and earth burned more than a hundred thousand imperial generals to ashes in an instant. Still, its power did not diminish, and it was left to reveal its fury on the battlefield.

With this blow, victory was assured.

The only question that remained was whether or not there were any strongmen lurking or inn hiding.

This is the reason why they had not allowed the enemy to escape in the battle.

Alvis, who was aware of Rimuru's usual mild-mannered character, was horrified by the thoroughness of this policy. At the same time, she was deeply convinced that this was how a demon lord should be.

"We rushed over here with 20,000 troops for support, but they were so easily overpowered. We can't claim to be repaying a favor like this."

"It was not the kind of thing that could be repaid, of course."

"Indeed. In that case, we can at least avoid making His Majesty Rimuru unhappy. Death is out of the question. Do everything you can so that no one gets hurt."

"You heard him, everyone! With the pride of being under the Beast King's command, do not let up and give it your all until the very end!"

Zor roared, and the Beast Master's Warrior Alliance responded.

And so, the beasts began their march on the right flank of the imperial army.

![break]

At this point, the momentum was clear.

The rear of the army was now in the grip of a great magical fury, and both the right and left flanks of the army were thoroughly overrun.

The Imperial Army was now merely waiting to be surrounded and annihilated.

Momiji looked upon this situation with cold eyes.

Her head was calm, but her heart was burning fiercely.

"It's about time. With the fire of compassion, let us save our enemies from the sea of suffering."

She muttered to herself and signaled to Gobua.

At the same moment, the Fourth Corps united their breaths and began to raise their demonic aura.

Through Gobua, the command was transmitted to the Kurenai, and a 'Telepathy Net' was sent to each member. Then, as if in a reversal, all of the youki raised by each member was transmitted to Kurenai, and they all harmonized beautifully.

Momiji's role was to unite them.

"Are you sure about this?" Gobua asked a little anxiously. Momiji, however, simply laughed it off.

"I am going to be Benimaru-sama's wife, what will I do if I am unable to do something to this extent?"

There was an unshakable confidence in her attitude.

The bound youki was being further concentrated into a single force to be used as a firepower against the enemy forces. This was Momiji's proposal.

It was a simple and clear-cut plan, but if the integration of the youki failed, it might cause an outburst. If that happened, Geld and the others who were keeping the front line would be affected. It was natural for Gobua to be worried, but she was silenced by Momiji's confidence.

Momiji was entrusted with the army as Benimaru's deputy. To doubt Momiji was tantamount to saying that she did not trust Benimaru.

"Then, I leave it to you. Shall we begin?"

"Yes. It's not as powerful as the magic that Carrera-san unleashed, but it is good enough for the rest of us. We will show them with this single blow."

Momiji then unveiled her once-in-a-lifetime great technique.

"I will bloom a red lotus flower that softly and gently envelopes the enemy. Now, watch carefully. Heavenly Beast Red Flame---!"

It was a red flower blooming in the sky.

Its primary purpose was to rapidly burn oxygen. By doing so, it deprived the ground of oxygen and rendered the enemies inoperable.

The second purpose was to pour down flames of mercy.

The high temperature would make the enemy unconscious before it could cause them pain.

The third objective was to force out the powerful enemies.

If the enemy could withstand this attack, they would be classified as a strong opponent. This magic was perfect for eliminating those who were in the way.

The flower that bloomed on the battlefield continuously fell.

There were no survivors.

"Oh? I'm disappointed."

"It was expected. The last ones to invade the labyrinth were superior to all the others. Perhaps they were the trump card of the imperial army."

"Yes, indeed. Now all that's left is the enemy command center."

"That, too, will be over soon. After all..."

"Oh, yes, of course. If someone who is like that Carrera-san has gone out there, there won't be single opponent who can be a match for him."

"I agree."

"In other words?"

"Yes. The battle is now ours."

As if on cue, the battlefield erupted in cheers.

The battle of annihilation, as the name of the decisive battle implied, had thus ended without incident.

![hard scene break]

Calgurio received numerous desperate reports. No, he didn't need to receive any more reports. A catastrophe had already occurred right before their eyes. The only thing they seemed to be lucky about was that the events were so fleeting that everyone died without fear or remorse.

On the other hand, those who survived the horrifying magic came running back to the main camp with their eyes wide open in despair. They had experienced soul-crushing horror, and they carried in their hearts a distrust of the empire as they lamented their own foolishness.

With no time for words, the staff generals shouted for retreat. But now, it was impossible for them to survive.

*How did this happen? Should I have chosen the path of slavery? No, when exactly did I make a mistake in the first place...?*

Calgurio tried desperately and unsuccessfully to get his spinning thoughts back to normal and once again looked at the hopeless war situation and considered the possible strategies available to him now.

There was no such thing. There was no way he could come up with such a convenient strategy at this late stage. No, rather than that...

"What...What is that? What the hell is that?!"

Calgurio was in a crucible of fear and confusion.

Such evil magic was beyond his comprehension.

How could it kill hundreds of thousands of soldiers protected by so many 'barriers' as if twisting a baby's hand?

Nearly 200,000 men were destroyed with a single blow.

It was only a matter of time before the rest of them were wiped out as well.

"What if..."

"What?"

"There's a theoretical magic that can interfere with the gravity of stars. This magic, which is the most powerful and the worst among all the magic classified as nuclear magic, requires an enormous amount of energy, and must be precisely controlled to be realized..."

"I remember hearing that from Gadra. Gravity Collapse, right?"

Yes, Calgurio had heard about that too.

It was a magic that was still under study, but it was theoretically possible. It was not a magic that had been confirmed in the past, but one that had been studied from the very beginning, with the best of the Empire's technology and the scientific knowledge of other worlds, and then abandoned as the theory was being constructed...

This was a strategic level magic that could annihilate not only the battlefield, but also a nation. However, it should have been concluded that it was impossible to realize.

And yet, they had succeeded in perfectly invoking it.

A single monster.

The demon lord.

The words reach Calgurio's brain with a real sense of dread. 'We have touched something we should never have touched,' he wanted to say.

"I am impressed by Calgurio-sama's knowledge."

Calgurio was jolted back to reality by the nosy voice of one of his advisors. Then Calgurio shouted, as if taking it out on him.

"That's just theoretical magic! Gadra boasted that he could slaughter Veldora if he was able to use it!"

"That's right. That's how powerful that magic is."

Before long, the general staff was divided into two groups.

"What...kind of monster? It's only...Just a single creature can do that kind of magic..."

Some went into a state of panic.

"Great. Hahaha! I'll write my paper when I get back! Now we can have that forbidden spell!"

And some discussed with each other like mad.

One group had lost their will to fight and the other group was running away from reality.

The command center had already lost its function.

There was nothing that could be done in the worst situation. But Calgurio was still the commander of the corps. He was responsible for the lives of the remaining soldiers. To throw this situation away was something Calgurio could never do. However, he was not in a position to retreat.

Including those who were running away, there were less than 2,000 soldiers left in the main camp. They were out of control, and even if they escaped, they would be slaughtered.

Calgurio desperately wanted power, more power.

As the empire had always done, all was forgiven when one was strong. It was only with overwhelming power that the world could be pacified.

But the end for those without power was dire.

Needless to say, this was obvious in Calgurio's current situation.

At the top of the empire were the "three generals", and Calgurio was proud to be a ranked among them. However, he had finally realized that it was all a lie.

*How helpless I was! How incompetent. What a weak man I am. I never realized that I was in such a miserable position, only to be exploited...*

He couldn't help but lament.

Wealth, fame, and all such things were worthless under the current circumstances. The most important thing was what one needed when they were in real trouble.

"I want power..."

Calgurio's eyes filled with tears.

Nearly a million soldiers had died believing in the glory of the empire and, by extension, in Calgurio as their commander-in-chief. Faced with this fact, Calgurio was devastated.

"Sir, I have a report! A huge flame was seen over the battlefield. The heat levels we're seeing indicate that those on the ground are not likely to survive."

"It's all over. The empire is now completely defeated..."

The staff generals fell silent as the deputy muttered something like that.

The escapees were also stunned, as if waking up from a dream. They tried to face the reality that awaited them, but their brains refused to accept it.

"I will offer our surrender. It is a gamble whether they will accept it or not, but there is a chance that they will find it useful. If we don't, they will kill us all anyway. I think it's our only chance of survival, don't you?"

It was better to be a slave than to die. That was the idea of someone who thought so, but he could not help feeling that it is a little late for that. Calgurio, however, decided to accept the proposal.

"...Agreed. It may be futile, but we can try to negotiate. At least, if we can turn the enemy's attention to us, we will have a better chance of Misha and the others escaping."

Even if it ended in their deaths, as long as the information was delivered to the empire, this defeat would have some meaning. This was the reason for their reluctant approval.

Calgurio's heart was already shattered, despite his modesty, as was typical of him. But because he was that way, he was able to think about what was best in this situation.

If he had reached this state of mind earlier, Calgurio would have been a great general of rare distinction. So much so that Calgurio, having abandoned his desires and vanities, had regained his original intelligence.

But now it was too late.

There was already no hope left for Calgurio and his comrades.

"Kufufufu...Surrender...that's no good. You'll have to deal with me for a while."

Diablo, who had been in the tent for some time, spoke up as he appeared. He was dressed in his butler's uniform as usual and had a smile on his beautiful face.

The moment Calgurio saw Diablo, he could see the absolute difference in power. Now that he had regained his cool judgment, he was not about to throw away his life in a moment of petty pride.

He has his guards lower their swords, saying that the first thing to do was to negotiate. It was the right thing to do, since a fight would inevitably end in defeat.

Out of the corner of Calgurio's eye, Krishna was saying, "It can't be..." and cowering. Like Calgurio, Krishna must have felt the overwhelming difference in ability and despaired.

Calgurio, feeling that he had made the right choice, decided to be the first to identify himself.

"My name is Calgurio, and I am the chief of this operation. May I ask your name?"

Diablo replied happily.

"Oh? That's very kind of you. My name is Diablo, a loyal servant of Demon Lord Rimuru-sama."

Diablo loved to say his own name.

Faced with such a Diablo, Calgurio began to think.

There was no way they could defeat Diablo. Even if everyone in the command center tried, it would be impossible to win.

The presence of this demon was denser than that of a huge dragon. The haki emanating from his body was more overwhelming than that of the Demon Lord Clayman, who had been friends with Calgurio.

Moreover, Diablo had appeared here without giving any sign of his presence. That is to say, he had invaded without leaving any trace of this tremendous haki.

Calgurio's heart was as quiet as if it were calm, despite the appearance of such an absolutely powerful being.

*This is our chance. He does not seem to be willing to allow our surrender, but he is open to negotiation. If we can buy time, we can keep this dangerous man at bay.*

Calgurio decided that this would increase the safety of Misha and the others who had fled.

But he was too naive.

"Kufufufu...Are you thinking of stalling for time?"

"What?"

"There was someone who escaped from here, so you're being used as the decoy. It's a very nice idea of self-sacrifice, but unfortunately, it's useless. Because we've already taken care of them."

A demon would sneak up on them and never let their pathetic prey escape.

As if to prove it, Diablo laughed. Then he pulled out two dead bodies from an empty space and laid them on the ground.

"Could that be the Single Digits...?!" Krishna exclaimed in shock.

The bodies belonged to Bernie and Jiwu.

Tensions ran high in the command center.

Krishna was not the only one shocked. Everyone there understood exactly what a Single Digit's defeat meant.

They couldn't beat Diablo. No, it was more than that.

*H-How...Then our deaths...the deaths of all the soldiers...will have no meaning at all!*

A deep despair gripped Calgurio.

"All of you, draw your swords! There is an intruder! We shall kill the intruder!" the second-in-command shouted, and his guards answered him.

Unlike Krishna, the guards were not aware of Diablo's strength. Therefore, they reacted without knowing that their actions were too reckless.

"Kufufufu... Do you think that you, lowly fools, can fight me on equal terms?" Diablo laughed.

But the second-in-command was not to be outdone.

"Shut up, you demon! There are still more than 1,000 warriors in the field. No matter how strong you are, what can you do with just one of you!" The second lieutenant is trying desperately to mask his fear with anger.

Calgurio couldn't move. He wanted to scream for them to stop, but he couldn't speak. What could he do with just one person, he had asked? Even though he was tempted to shout...

Calgurio now understood what strength was.

He understood what Emperor Rudra had wanted for them.

A single strong being can defeat an army of a million.

The proof of this was the supreme magic the enemy had just released.

And the fact that a Single Digit...that a monster could kill two of those strong beings...meant that he could easily destroy the Armored Corps.

The proof of that was...

"Kufufufu. That sentence came a little too late. You are the only survivors."

The deputy did not seem to comprehend what was being said. But Calgurio knew what was going on outside even without seeing it.

It had been bothering him for a while.

It was too quiet outside.

Then Diablo snapped his fingers.

At that moment, the tent blew away. Calgurio and the others were able to the scene outside.

There was a pile of dead bodies.

All the soldiers were dead as if they were sleeping.

Yes, as if only their souls had been taken out...

No, Calgurio realized, that was exactly what had happened. Before the soldiers could even resist, Diablo had taken their souls.

And now once again. That tragedy would be replayed before their eyes.

Diablo snapped his fingers and Krishna and the others fell to the ground.

![full page image](image14)

Calgurio's heart was filled with despair and sadness.

"U-Uh...uh...uwaaaaaah...!!" he screamed, crying tears of blood.

Immediately after that, Calgurio's emotions saturated and exploded---

![hard scene break]

Diablo had no reason to let the enemy soldiers escape.

Rimuru's orders were received, and Diablo had ridden happily into the fray. He found the enemy's headquarters by looking for Krishna's presence, and looked into the situation.

Bernie and the others had arrived there, and Diablo, who had no intention of letting any of them escape, naturally took action to eliminate them.

They were stronger than he had expected.

*Well, well, well... I didn't know that even if I had trained my Unique Skill to the maximum, it wouldn't work. But it seems that it was a borrowed power. It was unbalanced, or rather, I don't think they have awakened to their abilities yet. In that case, there is a way.*

Diablo had taken out the two with a fairly comfortable margin.

Misha, seeing this, had come out that she was Yuuki's subordinate.

Since Rimuru had given his tacit approval for the joint fight with Yuuki, it was unthinkable for Diablo to go against Rimuru's will. Therefore, he let Misha off the hook.

*But was that an Ultimate Skill? I was annoyed when Guy boasted about it a long time ago, but it is worth studying.*

Diablo, who has stopped weighing himself against becoming stronger, was able to throw away his stubbornness with aplomb. Diablo was a demon that could use anything as long as it was effective towards his goals.

Diablo, interested in Ultimate Skill in such a way, did not forget about his job.

He returned to the imperial army and invaded with ease.

And then, not wanting to cause any trouble, he took the lives of anyone who caught his eye with the "End of the World".

Quick and indiscriminate.

He killed all of the enemy soldiers without hesitation.

![break]

Calgurio roared before Diablo's eyes.

"Interesting," Diablo laughed.

Calgurio had pushed the limits of humanity. He must have had talent to begin with. Now that he had surpassed the Sage level, his energy level were increasing.

*Ah, an awakening out of despair. The sense of guilt seems to have brought him to a higher level. That is why you are worthy to fight me.*

Diablo had never been interested in getting stronger.

But now, he wanted power.

To be of use to the one he served---to be a useful tool for his master Rimuru.

For Diablo, a tool was meaningless if it did not show its ability to the Lord. He believed that a useless tool was not worth its existence.

That was the reason why he did not have his own subordinates.

He had always preferred to be alone, as he had no need for incompetent subordinates.

It was because Diablo was such a man that he never forgot about his own ambitions in being competent.

A battle against the strong was an opportunity that Diablo could not have wished for.

![hard scene break]

His roar sounded so distant. Calgurio awakened with that feeling. He was filled with power. It was a power like nothing he had ever experienced before, a power of epic proportions.

'Overwhelming,' Calgurio thought.

Anger, despair, and fear at the murder of his comrades had become the key to shattering his own limitations. And that power must have been the expectation that Emperor Rudra had placed in Calgurio.

*"I have high hopes for you."* Rudra had personally told him.

Calgurio ha never forgotten that day.

He had always thought that he would be the head of a legion and serve the empire. But this was a misinterpretation.

*Oh, I see. So His Majesty, Rudra-sama, wanted me to be awakened!*

Once he realized this, he understood that everything he had done did have meaning.

Now Calgurio had gone beyond Sage to Saint.

Cell by cell, his spirit overtook his flesh. Calgurio could understand the transformation of his own body. A tremendous power comparable to that of an awakened demon lord. Calgurio, awakened by the power, realized how incompetent he had been before.

Before this power, the Armored Corps was nothing. In other words, the imperial army could never defeat the demon lord or Veldora.

"I-I was a fool..."

"Kufufufu... You're right."

"But that is exactly why! I swear I will right my wrongs!"

As Calgurio shouted this, his body was enveloped in shining, divine armor.

The best armament since mythical times.

A mythical-grade armor lent to him by the emperor.

Only the Marshal and three generals were allowed to wear this armor, and it was the proof of the highest power of the Empire. It now recognized Calgurio as its true master.

"I won't forgive you, demon! I will destroy you!"

"Kufufufu, that's what makes it interesting."

Thus, the two sides clashed with each other, and the final battle began.

![break]

Calgurio pushed himself to the limit of his strength, and from the first attack, he threw out his all.

A fist protected by a cuirass was a deadly weapon by itself. It had the most destructive power, shattering almost all the materials in the world.

The speed of the tip of his fist exceeded the speed of sound, reaching a mythical realm that did not even leave an afterimage. The shockwave broke through the defenses of matter and destroyed molecular bonds. And the energy contained in the fist could pass through the mental barrier and damage the astral body. In other words, he could kill even a spiritual life form.

Calgurio knew of the name Diablo.

One of the Four Heavenly Kings of Demon Lord Rimuru, he was an evil demon. Unbelievably, the report had described him as a legendary "demon peer".

Calgurio used to mock the intelligence agency's findings, but now he believed the report to be true.

The Single Digits were the only ones who could challenge them, and yet both were defeated. It was no wonder that he was such a fearsome existence.

But Calgurio's fear was now gone.

*I admit that he is a fearsome devil, but he is not my enemy now. With this power, I will defeat every "True Dragon", "demon lord", and "Hero"!*

If a person's power was considered to be 1, the physical ability of a person who was designated as A rank was at least 10 or more.

For a greater majin, it was close to 100.

An archdemon had a record of 140.

If one was a demon lord, they must be at least 300.

True dragons were unmeasurable, but they were estimated to be over 1000.

And now, Calgurio realized that his power exceeded 1000.

This was a world where only those who have awakened to sainthood could reach. Moreover, Calgurio was clad in a mythical-grade armor that contained energy comparable to his own.

With this power, he could destroy even a "demon peer". It was not surprising that Calgurio felt so convinced.

"Alas, how disappointing..."

His fist was lightly swatted away by Diablo.

"How can this be?!"

"What is there to wonder about?"

"Wh-Why are you still alive?"

A blow like that should have destroyed any demon. He could not accept such a ridiculous story that he was completely unharmed.

"Why, you ask? The reason is simple. You are not skilled enough to handle your power."

Diablo answered as if it were nothing.

"I can't handle it?"

"Yes. I, for one, personally feel very sorry. It's too early to fight you. The other two were stronger. They may have been borrowing the Ultimate Skill, but they still had it in their bodies. If you had awakened to that power earlier, we would have had a much more enjoyable fight..."

Fruits must ripen before they can be eaten. Diablo lamented that he had reaped the harvest too soon.

It was an insult Calgurio did not want to admit to.

"Damn you! Don't you dare, you demon!" he shouted, but the situation was worse.

Calgurio understood in his heart.

He understood that he was no match for the demon in front of him.

And above all, he understood the secret of the power of the "Single Digits".

The greatest warriors of the empire had been selected by Emperor Rudra and lent their ultimate power to him.

This was confirmed by Diablo's word "borrowed".

Diablo did not understand it because it was not power that he had acquired on his own.

No matter how great the power was, it was meaningless unless one understood the essence of their power and mastered it. This was true for Calgurio himself.

Diablo's statement that it was too early to fight him was a reality that could not be denied.

"Whoo, o-ooooh, oooooohhh!"

He realized that he could not win. Still, Calgurio did his best.

If he did not at least try to avenge them, all of their actions would have been in vain. To deny this, Calgurio fought recklessly.

But it could not be called a battle anymore.

For Diablo, who had rightly uncovered Calgurio's capabilities, this was now nothing more than a chore.

Even his mythical-grade armor, with all its power, was unable to fully exploit Calgurio's current capabilities. He was recognized as the master, but they did not understand each other enough to harmonize.

The mythical-grade armor had a will. Calgurio had not had enough time to accumulate enough time to become a true master.

A tool was meaningful only when one knew how to use it. There was nothing sadder than a tool that could not be used to its full potential.

In the end, Calgurio, the last man in the imperial army, was defeated without being able to bring out Diablo's true potential.

And then his soul was reaped.
