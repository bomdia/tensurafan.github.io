# Epilogue: The Doing of|a Demon Lord

Calgurio awoke, feeling his body enveloped in a warm and comfortable sensation.

*W-where am I?*

He could not recall what he had been doing until now. Calgurio quickly glanced at his surroundings in panic. It was then that he realized that he had been lying in a spacious room.

It was there that a silverish blue-haired young girl, about twelve or thirteen, was doing something while bearing an angelic smile.

Calgurio looked in her direction to find that she was putting her hands above the people lying on the ground. Rainbow-like light began to emit from her hands and enveloped Calgurio's companions.

*Is that Krishna-dono? Wait, no, I saw Krishna-dono being killed right in front of me...*

Although he was still having trouble processing things, he recalled the situation. Calgurio realized that he and his army had been waging a war invading the monster kingdom.

Panicked, he tried to rise and shout to alert, yet words could not escape his mouth as Krishna, who should already be dead, slowly opened his eyes and met with those of Calgurio.

"...!"

The newly awakened Krishna reacted similarly to Calgurio, he seemed just as unaware about his situation too. Confused, his eyes began to follow the movements of the young girl as well.

The blue-haired young girl didn't seem to realize either of them had woken up as she continued to carry out the same procedure as before.

In front of her lay Bernie and Jiwu. Next to them were Calgurio's adjutants and tacticians.

*W-what is going on here... They were supposed to have died too...*

Even though his mind was in chaos, Calgurio still quickly accepted the facts of the situation calmly. Yet he could not explain the phenomenon that was taking place.

Indeed, they all should have been dead.

There was not the slightest movement on their chest, so they were obviously not breathing. Yet as the young girl's hand hovered above them, they began to regain life one by one.

There were around a dozen imperial officers in this room, and in a short while, everyone was given the same procedure.

The young girl finally nodded with satisfaction as she turned her head to Calgurio.

"Yo, have you woken up? How do you feel? Do you still remember your name?"

The young girl said so to Calgurio in a rather smug tone.

But it was not irritating.

It was likely due to the petite look of the young girl, but perhaps the most important reason was that Calgurio could not seem to bring himself to detest the aura the young girl was giving off.

Though he was still unable to properly make a reaction in response.

Still unclear of their current situations, everyone decided to keep their mouths shut.

Even the "Single Digits" Bernie and Jiwu looked oblivious and completely stunned at the scene.

Seeing how confused Calgurio and everyone looked, the young girl spoke up softly.

"Eh, did I mess it up? The spell was pretty perfect in theory..."

A rather puzzled look emerged on her face.

![full page image](image15)

Hearing this, Calgurio finally realized that they were all being cast under some sort of spell. In his mind, he was pondering whether the spell could have been---

*N-No way, that's insane, there's no way, it's not possible, but...*

He didn't feel anything strange with his body.

---No, actually, there was something.

Calgurio had previously boosted his power immensely, yet after waking up, he felt that all the power he had gained had disappeared. He could only imagine what terrifying things had taken place prior.

"...Excuse me, but shouldn't we be dead already?" Calgurio asked fearfully.

Hearing this, his fellow companions began to regain their memories too. Eyes wide open, all of them had begun to sense that things were not right.

Calgurio and them should have already been killed by the demon that called himself Diablo. There was no reason why he would have spared them, that's why Calgurio had been doubtful as to whether he was still living now.

"Oh, are you regaining your memories? So do you still remember your name?"

"Uh, umm, my name is Calgurio." As he answered, Calgurio thought of another possibility.

Perhaps this young maiden had saved Calgurio and the rest from their imminent death. There was no way that she could have rescued them from that situation without quite the able body.

That demon was an unimaginably powerful opponent, even when Calgurio obtained extraordinary power. The demon defeated Calgurio almost as easy as twisting an infant's hand. Moreover, even the "Single Digit" individuals like Bernie were also...

If anyone could have taken on a demon like that, Calgurio could only think of the legendary "Hero".

"C-could it be that you were the one who saved us? W-What about the demon? What happened to that evil demon?" Calgurio summoned up his courage and asked.

As soon as he finished his sentence---

"How dare you act so rude to Rimuru-sama."

Those words were uttered.

The voice was familiar, thought Calgurio, it was just like that of the demon's.

The bigger problem was the name Rimuru.

After all, Calgurio and the others' goal in this invasion was to fight against the demon lord with that very same name.

The demon named Diablo appeared before Calgurio. He couldn't help but tense his body in fear. It was then that the young girl intervened and stopped Diablo.

"Uhh---some of you seem to have gotten things mixed up, so allow me to explain. You were all dead, your army was completely obliterated and none of the soldiers survived, or I at least I figured there weren't any. So I didn't exactly save any of you, I only revived you all."

"Kufufufufu, a truly splendid skill. I ask not for your gratitude, but do be impressed by Rimuru-sama's great deeds."

"---Huh?"

*What the hell are they talking about*, Calgurio couldn't help but give out an audible confusion. Yet no one was able to make fun for losing his cool.

"Drop the smug act already, Diablo."

"My sincere apologies. I was merely trying to enlighten the ignorant of the greatness of Rimuru-sama---"

"That's exactly why I told you to stay out of it!"

Even with such a cringe-inducing dialogue on display in front of everyone, no one could gather the fortitude to crack a joke at it.

A little while later, the young girl spoke to Calgurio with a smile.

"Looks like there's no problem with your memory. I'm at ease knowing the spell has worked."

"Y-Yes..."

"Okay then, allow me to introduce myself properly this time. Nice to meet you all, I am Rimuru, Demon Lord Rimuru, who also happens to be the ruler of this kingdom. I hope we get along!"

Calgurio froze up as he heard this. Not only him, but everyone else who was revived did the same. When those words were processed in his mind, Calgurio's eyes began to widen to the max upon understanding what she meant. He fixed his eyes on this young girl.

This was Rimuru. This was the enemy that the Empire had deemed an obstacle necessary to eliminate. And now also one of the Octagram. It was Demon Lord Rimuru in the slime.

Judging from the situation, she was the one who had resurrected Calgurio and the others. With the demon lord in front of him, that smile was nothing like the drawings which were issued before the march. But the real problem lay elsewhere.

"E-excuse me, but I wish to confirm something..."

"Hmmm? What is it?"

"Um," Calgurio stammered, "were you the one who resurrected us?"

"Mhm, that's right."

"Wha---why?"

"Well, it's a bit difficult to explain, basically I had to transfer the soul---"

"No no no, that's not the point! I mean why had you decided to resurrect your enemies?"

"Oh, so it's about that?"

Upon being asked by Calgurio, the young maiden---correction, the Demon Lord Rimuru, nodded, almost as if in relief. He answered rather care-freely.

"It's simple. Since the war is still on-going, now that you guys have fallen into my hands, you shall now serve as my pawns!"

'That's why I resurrected you lot!' he had said.

Calgurio froze up as if he failed to understand for a while.

Demon Lord Rimuru brought people back to life?

Who? Them?

Shock and chaos on top of terror began to creep into his heart. It wasn't just Calgurio, but also all of those who were resurrected.

It would take some time before peace was restored from the chaos once more.

![hard scene break]

I went outside, leaving Calgurio and the rest to sort out their confusion by themselves.

Speaking of which, they were all important people in this legion, some of the highest-ranking officers in charge of the Empire's invasion plan.

My reason for reviving them was just as I'd told Calgurio---to use them as pawns. This was another premeditated scheme webbed by Raphael-san.

.........

......

...

Resurrecting the dead...

Ever since the incident with Shion's death, Raphael-san had been analyzing people's souls. So far things had been going well, and we had almost figured out the laws and principles behind it. This applied not only to humans, but monsters, whose souls could be quantified. It was a matter of the pieces called the "Information Particle". As long as one could control this, they may in a sense control life and death.

Disregarding the quality of animals and plants' souls, whose quantities were fairly low, humans, on the other hand, possessed souls that contained immense power.

I had made sure that everyone here would be given an equal proportion. And depending on whether a person could utilize the energy that was their soul well---it could lead to the person discovering their soul's power that could be compared to skills.

The information embedded in one's soul was the source of one's strength. If that was the case, was it possible to directly imbue information to energy---Well, that was unlikely.

First of all, there would be plenty of "selfs" that existed on different wavelengths, and the combined entity of Information Particles would encapsulate them---thus forming a core that included all of the information.

The crystallization of the energy that encapsulated one's core would be their "soul". The Emulated Soul for example, was developed to be used as the container for such a core. The core projected into an Emulated Soul contained no energy, but it possessed "selfs". A soul without power could not perform any skills, yet it could act when the "self" was present.

![break]

As for this operation to revive Calgurio and his comrades, I used the replacement for souls---Emulated Souls. By taking their souls and separating them from their cores, I could preserve the bare minimum of energy needed for them to be transferred to Emulated Souls.

.........

......

...

Even though I had been unsure about the success rate, it was a relief that it worked in the end. Although, this resurrection was not perfect.

Firstly, all of them would be drastically weakened, since their souls' power had been taken by me, that was certain. Since I had robbed their souls clean, there was really no point in returning them. I honestly didn't think they'd have the right to complain either. As a result, they wouldn't be able to use their Skills in the future.

Even if their cores were imbued with information of Skills, they could not use them without the power of their souls. They wouldn't have any chance to learn or use those Skills in the future either. It would also impact their ability to use magic, which they should also work on to improve for future references.

To some extent, if one were to get used to it, they could use magic even with a powerless soul. Magic was both a Skill and an Art, by utilizing the magicule in the air to replace their souls' energy, they would be able manipulate principles of magic.

And if they were to use magicules to replace fighting aura, they would even be able to use Arts. If their body weakened, they could retrain them, and with enough practice they'd be able to keep any arts they had mastered, as long as the person had not been relying on skills too much.

In other words, with enough effort they'd be strong again. Although the quantity of strength would probably be different, there was probably a threshold to their growth. After all, Emulated Souls were merely toys to make the Labyrinth more entertaining, I hadn't put too much expectation on it anyway. But it should do just fine for this occasion.

I didn't revive these Empire soldiers for their well-being, I merely wanted to avoid our reputation from souring. That would determine how the world saw us. It was the Empire who attacked us first, anyway, so getting killed was really just the fruit of their actions. I was in no way obligated to resurrect them.

With that being said, reviving them was, at the very least, better than damaging our reputation by not doing anything. If there was any value added on top of that, it'd probably be for the citizens of the Empire to not bear hatred against us.

It was really a relief that Raphael-san's experiment was a success. Now that all of them had been revived, we planned to hold the more important figures accountable. Right now, they were also under Souei's watchful eyes. Even though I had revived them, they could only live a "fake life". They only had limited degrees of freedom, and we could track them no matter what.

In other words, running away would be impossible.

And that was that. I was gonna leave these guys as they were.

Right now, I planned to finish my own work. Since I had confirmed the effectiveness of the ritual on Calgurio and the others, it seemed to be working fine, so I decided to perform it on a larger scale.

![break]

In front of me were around seven-hundred-thousand corpses. Since we wanted to be able to respond quickly to whatever happened later, we had chosen to perform the ritual inside the labyrinth.

Floor 70, which would be Adalmann's territory.

We collected as many corpses from the battlefield as possible. Then I suggested to utilize large-scale teleportation to move all of them here. Gobta, Geld, Gabil, and all the floor guardians moved out and recovered the corpses. All of these were corpses of people that could be revived this time.

The troops deployed in front of Dwargon's Eastern City remained quiet, it seemed that the situation had entered a stalemate.

As for the 940,000 soldiers that invaded Great Jura Forest, everyone had died in battle except Misha, Lucius, and Raymond. Among them, there were approximately 240,000 corpses that were impossible to retrieve.

The reason for that was because resurrection could not reanimate souls. Only thanks to Testarossa and the rest, could we retrieve "souls", and so we needed the remains of their bodies to have a chance at resurrection...

Yet some of these people had been completely obliterated.

For instance, people who had been vaporized by Ultima's "Nuclear Flame" or those who were completely disintegrated by Testarossa's Death Streak, and those who had been turned into dust by Carrera's 'Gravity Collapse.'

Moreover, there were those who could not be revived even without corpse remains. Those who have died of fear and despair. These were the ones who could not be resurrected because their most important ego was gone.

For example, Kansas who was killed by Kumara. It seems that his mind was broken by fear at the moment of his death, and there was no Information Particle left in his soul.

Even Wisdom King Raphael-san couldn't restore the Information Particle itself. So, there was nothing I could do. But I didn't feel it was a problem, since I didn't intend to bring a man like Kansas back to life anyway.

And so, more than 240,000 people were not revivable... I guess we can say that we were lucky to have such a small number of people, since they would have all died.

I felt sorry for those who could not come back to life, but I would just give up on their bad luck.

I was not an all-powerful god either. I could not create something out of nothing. Besides... To tell the truth, I had no regrets. I think the three demon girls had gone too far, but this was war. If we cut corners and got ourselves killed, it would be meaningless.

The only people who mattered to me were my people, and if I had to compare my people with others who had nothing to do with me, I would protect my people without hesitation. And I did not intend to say like a saint that we should be compassionate to the enemy soldiers who invaded our country. With such a flowery mindset, I would be unable to take responsibility for the real damage.

That is why I did not care about those who could not come back to life. I didn't have any personal feelings for the people who had died, but I did feel something for them, perhaps because I still had the sensibility of one from Japan, which was a peaceful country.

This was not regret, and I didn't think what I did is wrong, but it was something I still couldn't get used to. I couldn't help thinking that it would be better if everyone could live happily and peacefully without dying. Still, I would continue to show no mercy to those who invaded my domain, and I would continue to terrorize them thoroughly... It would be hypocritical of me to pray for their souls.

So, for now, I would say a silent prayer not for the dead, but for those who could come back to life.

![break]

The "Sacred Birthday" was deployed. Calgurio and the others came out of the room, their eyes wide open in astonishment. At this rate, I wonder if their eyes will be able to stay open.

Well, it was none of my business. Let's just get this over with.

I implanted a duplicate Emulated Soul in every corpse. Since this was an emergency, I would make the best use of my 'duplicates'. In this way, I had enough Emulated Souls for each individual.

The restoration of the bodies were finished. Thanks to Adalmann and all the other holy magic users, they were all clean now. All of them worked without sleep even though they were working for the enemy soldiers. I was grateful to them.

Adalmann, for example, had worked more than others because he did not need to sleep. He must have been more tired than when he was fighting. I decided that I would give him a big "thanks" for his work.

And so, the transplantation of the Emulated Souls to the clean corpses was completed. I was putting it simply, but it went without saying that the work was done by the overwhelming computing power of Wisdom King Raphael.

Next, we performed the "Secret Art of Anti-Soul Return", which was not the "Secret Art of Soul Return".

Since this was different from the rebirth of the soul, it did not require much energy. The problem was, rather, that it required a huge amount of calculation to identify each individual.

Again, this was all to be done by Wisdom King Raphael-sensei. I was practically doing nothing. I just stood in silent contemplation and left everything to it. The way it identified individuals in an instant by comparing the genetic information of their bodies with the records of their souls was so brilliant that I had no choice but to call it 'sensei'.

I could never have done that. It was a complicated and mysterious technique. But... Calgurio and the others seemed to think that I was doing everything. At some point, they prostrated themselves and began to make some kind of reverential gesture.

Wait, I'll feel uncomfortable if you keep doing that.

It was too much of a misunderstanding, and I wanted them to stop it. I couldn't complain until the surgery was finished, even though I wanted to.

And so, for a day and a night, I continued to use the secret technique in this uncomfortable situation. The resuscitation of about 700,000 imperial generals was successfully completed.

![hard scene break]

The 70th floor was lined with simple tents where the revived were fed.

Those who had been confused immediately after their resuscitation were now calm. Everyone was silently concentrating on their meals, as if tasting the feeling of being alive.

A variety of vegetables and meats were stewed in a large pot, a food with a unique taste like a stew.

It was warm and filling.

The soup was indescribably moving to the Imperial Army soldiers who were slowly becoming aware of the reality now that the chaos was over.

Calgurio was one of those defeated soldiers.

Unaware of his hunger, he felt the tension in the air being lifted. As he realized this, he slowly realized over and over again that they had died once before, killed by Demon Lord Rimuru's subordinates.

But they were all still alive.

The demon lord had said it was a "false life".

*"Don't worry. There are no inconveniences if one is living a normal life You could fall in love, have a family, have children. But there is a limit on the actions that would be detrimental to us! The curse I have engraved in your Pseudo Soul makes it impossible for you to ever act hostile to us again. I hope you can understand that."*

---Once the chaos was over, he had told them this in front of everyone.

But Calgurio was convinced that there is no need for such a "curse".

Who would ever dare to repeat such a folly twice?

When Veldora had struck hundreds of years ago, only horror could be felt as a result. But even so, it is not impossible to produce a comparable disaster by human hands, even if a city disappears and all its inhabitants disappear.

Was that why?

The fear was felt, but no one truly believed him to be invincible. Or rather, if there had been more survivors, the fundamental fear might have been conveyed and the inviolability might have been asserted more, but that would have been the limit after all.

But this time, however, there was no way to make such a mistake. They died, and then were resurrected... All by the hand of not a god, but a demon lord. How could anyone think of defying him when he showed them such a ridiculous miracle?

*We---I was too stupid... I understand that I was too arrogant.*

No, was this really the work of a demon lord in the first place?

Calgurio couldn't help but wonder about that.

Overnight, Krishna and others seemed to have made Demon Lord Rimuru the object of their faith. He was now following him with his eyes as if he were still worshiping him. Well, it was Calgurio who started worshiping the demon lord first, so he couldn't and wouldn't complain...

The demon lord had said "false life", but there was actually no problem with this either. Indeed, the ability to fight was gone. But it wasn't so much that it was hard to live. Even Calgurio and the others could still defeat a certain number of monsters.

To Demon Lord Rimuru, they may have been insignificant, but to Calgurio's group, some of them still had the strength close to A rank. They could not use their Skills, and they had difficulty in using magic, but they still had a well-trained body. And they were allowed to live until their bodies aged and they reached the end of their biological life span. That was enough, Calgurio thought. And this was the same feeling shared by all of the approximately 700,000 soldiers.

No one would dare to rebel against Demon Lord Rimuru when they were all so grateful and in awe. They were defeated from the bottom of their hearts.

Everyone wanted the war to be over.

The imperial invasion could only be described as a complete failure.
