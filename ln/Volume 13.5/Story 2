# Story 2: Goddess of|the Ever-night|Kingdom

I am the one they called Luminas.^[Luminas addresses herself like a noble (boomer), using the pronoun of å¦¾ (warawa)]

Luminas Valentine, the ruler of the old world---a vampire.

I was the one at the top of the food chain, the Queen of Nightmares.

However, politics were truly troublesome and upsetting to me. I needed only to pose as though I were being thoughtful and nod in agreement.

That being the case, it would be sufficient to have subordinates deal with it in my stead. In more ancient times, I acquired Gunther---the king of an opposing force---under my reign. It was definitely the right choice. Gunther had freed me from my duty and built up a system of governance. Even though he would complain at times, all of our accomplishments were dependent on him. And for that alone, my kingdom prospered.

![break]

Yet even so, I still got shit from that fucking lizard, Veldora.

If I hadn't met Chloe at the time, there would have been hell to pay. Just thinking about it made me feel appreciation for Chloe beyond words. And of course, for Hinata as well, who was within Chloe. I treated them both as true friends from that point onward. While I may have acted as though there were nothing wrong with the two of them, that wasn't actually the case. I had some complaints regarding both of them. For instance, their description of events was unspecific, to say the least.

"Yeah, there's about to be a huge earthquake---"

So I was warned. But then, it only came in decades' time.

"There's gonna be an epidemic, please be prepared for it---"

Even though that may have been the case, we could only deal with the specifics of the plague after the outbreak began.

![break]

And so, so many other countless examples; Chloe's testimonies were simply too vague. At first, I thought it was unclear due to her memories being blurry. But then I realized: Chloe was doing it on purpose. She had no intention to prevent any disaster from happening.

Chloe was a kind person. Yet why would someone as kind as Chloe not try to prevent crises while knowing all about them?

My suspicion solidified with every following unnatural result that occurred. Assessing the aftermath of each disaster revealed that the number of casualties was reduced---she disclosed bits of information to me while deliberately hiding key details.

So why would Chloe do such things?

She claimed to know the future and I believed her when she said this. Perhaps it was because I didn't question any of her words that I now found myself disgruntled... It should be a friend's duty, my duty, to be considerate of what she thinks. And that's when I reached a conclusion.

Chloe didn't wish to change the future. To be more precise, it was to ensure she walked the path she was familiar with, the one she wanted to let happen.

![break]

*Wouldn't it be better to at least share her real thoughts with me*...

That's what bothered me about her. Despite this, we shared a very close relationship. We had gotten to know each other heart to heart, having spent more than a thousand years together. And above all, it was a real joy for me when she gave that goddamn Veldora a fierce thrashing. Sadly, such wonderful days I lived with her suddenly came to an end.

![break]

"As a matter of fact, Luminas, I... I may be disappearing soon."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, it may be a little exaggerated to say I'm disappearing. It's more like falling asleep. However, Hinata will still remain for a while, so you could say it's a personality swap."

"Personality swap..."

![break]

I was plunged into turmoil when Chloe broke the news to me out of the blue. This was another one of Chloe's bad habits. She knew too much herself and always failed to explain things properly because of it.

Afterwards, I got to know the details from her.

I reached some level of understanding from her after I inquired into future events. It would seem by the time Chloe visited this world, due to the existence of multiple Chloes^[Explained in volume 11, Chloe coming to the world with Leon], the consciousness of the current version would thus disappear. Thereupon Hinata's personality would take her place.

That's about how it worked. That would be fine, but a problem arose soon thereafter.

"So, in another three hundred years, wouldn't it be time for Hinata's consciousness to disappear?"

"Hmm, that would probably be the case."

"I understand. When that time comes, I shall personally seal you up with my power."

Rather than being sentimental about Chloe's disappearance, what followed had to be carefully considered. It would be fine as long as Hinata stuck around, but it seemed she would disappear eventually as well. Should that come to pass, I questioned what would happen to the remaining Chloe.

According to her speculation, she would undoubtedly lose control. Within Chloe, there apparently dwelled a "broken consciousness", Chronoa, that knew the future. If that consciousness awoke, it would likely take over as the third personality and rain destruction upon the world.

That was truly a troublesome issue I got informed of. But I would do what I could for my friend's sake.

I suspected that some important elements had deliberately been tweaked or left out by Chloe and Hinata. I would still choose to trust them, nonetheless.

![soft scene break]

This was a disaster!

This wasn't just some slight adjustment; things went completely different from what I was told. No, if it were altogether completely different, I would have just given up on trusting the narrative. But everything had been the same up until Hinata's arrival. But after that, after the appearance of the slime named Rimuru, things went off the rails.

"Rimuru-san is a magnificent individual as well as my benefactor. But a lot will happen, and the situation will develop to the point where Hinata and Rimuru-san confront each other, so Luminas, you must not intervene."

Keeping my promise, I decided to observe for the time being. Yet the chaos had no end. The one who took the initiative was Hinata. Nonetheless, I was reassured. From what I heard from Chloe, the battle at the outskirts of the Kingdom of Ingracia could be avoided.

But...how did this develop to the point that Rimuru was deliberating waging battle against Hinata?

![break]

*Due to the conspiracy in Farmus, the surrounding council states will reach the consensus to have Hinata lead an army and confront the Tempest Federation. At that time, Hinata and Rimuru will be able to reach an agreement and achieve peace.*

![break]

Or so I was told, but as soon as Rimuru and Hinata finished their battle, I was able to confirm that nothing I'd heard held any credibility. In that moment, I had a bad feeling about the future.

And that premonition became a reality.

![break]

---Rimuru became a demon lord---

The Kingdom of Farmus waged war on its own and was eliminated without survivors. It was rumored that they were devastated as a result of Veldora's resurrection, but that was also questionable.

Moreover, the issue at hand was Rimuru's ascension to the rank of demon lord. In the following Walpurgis Banquet, we were to discuss what to do with the self-proclaimed demon lord, Rimuru. In light of this entire situation, I felt it necessary to attend, deciding to participate in disguise as a maid.

Even though it wasn't foretold to happen in the future, I didn't try to get on Rimuru's bad side. I would've been fine with that outcome, but it would've been bad if I hurt Chloe's heart in that way. If anything, I could even take him under my protection---I observed the development of the banquet with that in mind.

Rimuru turned out to be an unexpectedly impressive individual. He didn't cower in front of all of the demon lords and was able to state his opinions righteously. On that basis, he deliberately provoked Clayman and led things in his favor, dominating the situation. It was an admirable display, but I was also concerned for him, since I wasn't sure how things would develop.

By the end, Rimuru was officially recognized as a demon lord and became a part of the 'Octagram'.

Then that other guy exposed my identity so casually, ruining my plan of passing the title of 'Demon Lord' to Roy. Now I had to be crowned the title again in such a graceless manner.

*This is giving me a headache*, so I thought, but it really couldn't be helped.

![break]

Every. Single. Problem. Was CAUSED BY THAT EVIL DRAGON!

![break]

My suffering continued well after the unrest at Walpurgis concluded. That same fateful night, Roy, whom I entrusted the title of 'Demon Lord', was murdered. And without leaving me time to marvel, Hinata set out to make peace with Rimuru. I agreed it would be bad to antagonize him, so I decided to keep an eye on how things would develop...

![break]

Too dangerous.

Hinata stepped right into a trap and almost got killed. Had I not intervened, things would've seriously gone south. A group that had slipped to the back of my mind returned to the fore, it was the Seven Luminary Clerics, who's conspiracy had just been unveiled. The head of the group, Gran, instigated their betrayal.

![break]

Then---

It brought out another gripe I had with Chloe. Hinata and Rimuru fought and, at last, reconciled as companions---at least according to Chloe, who neither explained why there was a second battle, nor did she ever mention Gran's betrayal. Current events diverged significantly from the future Chloe foretold---or was that simply what she wished me to think? Perhaps there was a reason for it...

It was beyond me to draw a conclusion from everything that had been going on. I wouldn't be able to see my friends Chloe and Hinata now anyway.

![break]

Moving on.

Rimuru's misunderstanding involving Hinata was resolved and I was able to set things right with him. I had some qualms about getting personally involved at the battlefield, but things seemed to have worked out fine.

By the way, I got to exact revenge on Veldora. The sight of him crying brought me tremendous joy. He was also different from before---not causing havoc everywhere he went. I was downright surprised seeing it, and even more so, learning that he was actually listening to other people. Now that was a shocker.

I'd honestly begun to question my eyes seeing him follow Rimuru's orders like a puppy. Could this be part of the future Chloe foresaw?

For every time I grumbled about Veldora, she unfailingly wore a look that expressed a desire to reveal something. It would seem that Hinata within Chloe held a bitter grudge towards him. In spite of this, she didn't deem Veldora to be evil incarnate, requiring extermination. And that austere Hinata with her strong sense of justice had probably forgiven Veldora by now.

Even so, they did give him a solid beat-down when sealing him, presumably allowing her to vent that anger. Either way, the current version of Veldora wasn't that annoying after all, or so I thought.

![soft scene break]

Since history unfolded differently from the predictions, it allowed me to become acquainted with Rimuru. Though considering it in a different light, it was a stroke of luck. Not only were we both members of the 'Octagram', we also got a chance to talk directly. I was determined to make the most of the opportunity.

Rimuru declared he would be hosting a feast celebrating the reconciliation, and before that, he brought us to the bathhouse. A bathhouse---it's where maids fill the tub with water and help me scrub my body, right? Metabolism was unnecessary for my body, so there was no need to bathe. Still, I enjoyed it as a symbol of luxury.

At least that was my impression, but what awaited me when we reached the bathhouse defied my expectations entirely. There was a spacious pool, large enough for dozens of people. In fact, the baths were built out of polished stone and hot water was pouring into the pool. I also saw tubs fashioned from aromatic wood and heated rooms where you could warm up in the hot air.

"Wh-what is this..."

"This, hot spring...? And there is a sauna and everything. That man really does whatever comes to his mind..."

I was shocked by the unfamiliar facilities; Hinata, who came along, was surprised in a different sense. The variety of infrastructure all seemed familiar to her, explaining them to me as we bathed.

![break]

"I see. So Rimuru has recreated the facilities familiar to him in this world, right?"

"That's what it seems. I'm quite surprised by the facilities on the streets, but they are nothing compared to this. I wonder how much labor and funds were invested to build something this amazing."

"At the end of the day, Rimuru is a newly risen demon lord. If he chooses to command all of his monsters, such feats are probably a piece of cake."

"That may be the case...but I still can't really accept it."

![break]

Hinata seemed frustrated by it. That was to be expected.

For the longest time, Hinata fought vigorously in an effort to improve the standard of living for our people. Although the seeds of her hard work had started to sprout, it would take many more years before any of its fruits were borne. On the other hand, these achievements were so casually displayed in Rimuru's country. I couldn't fault her for it, that surely put a damper on her mood.

Anyway, this bathhouse was really nice. I had to admit that. After all, I got to savor Hinata's beautiful, nude body.

It was a feast for my eyes---her body without a single piece of clothing on it. Her tight waist and alluring, curved hips drew me in. Her luscious pair of breasts proudly presented themselves, giving me the scenery of my life. It was a truly bewitching sight, beautiful as if she were a work of art. Her pale white skin, smooth as newly fallen snow, with a pinch of cherry red. I really had to thank Rimuru for the creation of this hot spring, for now I was able to justifiably appreciate Hinata's dazzling form. If I got to spend joyful hours like this, I figured I should build a bathhouse in my country as well---I made up my mind in secret.

"Ah, this is heaven."

"Hmm, indeed."

"I mean, you don't have to be so alerted. Rimuru isn't the type to spy on us."

"So, there's no need to enable 'Magic Perception'," Hinata laughed at me.

That was close, that was close...

I was solely focused on appreciating her naked body, but instead that got mistaken for something else. "Hmm-ummm, yeah," I responded, reluctantly deactivating 'Magic Perception'.

![soft scene break]

After the bath, it was time for a feast.

Before my eyes lay dishes I'd never seen before. Also, a new challenge awaited me among them. There were two cylindrical sticks placed near my hands---the utensils known as "chopsticks". I heard they were used in the east and the Eastern Empire, but it was my first time seeing a pair. In other words, I had no idea how to use them. Actually, I did know how they were used, but I wasn't confident in my ability to use them properly.

*Luminas, who is perfect in whatever she does, is clueless when using chopsticks*---I couldn't let such rumors spread.

Moreover, Veldora was here as well. If I were to mess up in front of him, who knows what type of shenanigans he would pull on me. If he dared to pull a smirking "Pu-hehe" within earshot, I'd blow my lid and start a brawl. In order to prevent such an outburst, I had to overcome the challenge at hand.

I was racking my brain for a solution while trying to maintain composure. And then---

"Well, let us raise our cups for the courageous battles fought by everyone here, cheers!"

Rimuru's word set the feast in motion.

![break]

There were a variety of steamy, mouthwatering dishes, and a golden drink was poured into my crystal-clear glass. I was something of a gourmet myself, so at a glance, I could tell each dish possessed top-notch quality. In this type of circumstance, proper etiquette was of utmost importance.

My social awareness engaged, and I reflexively lifted my glass.

Down it went.

I Observed the others around me while taking a drink. That should give me time to come up with some great plan---I took a sip and thought it over.

"This is really tasty."

Somehow that slipped out of my mouth, but it was undoubtedly my honest opinion. The cooling sensation glid down my throat elegantly. It was a refreshing experience unknown to me, someone who possessed extensive knowledge about wines. The Holy Knights attending alongside me shared my surprise about this fine wine.

"Huu, it's cold," Hinata shivered. "Could this be beer?"

"It's all right, I guess," Rimuru responded. "It took me some effort to recreate it and it's on-par with what I drank in Japan. It's quite similar, you know."

"Is that so? This may be the first time I'm drinking this, but I don't find it particularly tasty. Though compared to the beer in this world, I'd definitely drink this over that stuff."

Hinata expressed her thoughts to Rimuru.

This reminded me, it's what she said back when Hinata, an underage student at the time, arrived in this world. I taught her how to drink when she claimed she'd never tried any alcohol.

How would a drunk Hinata lose her style? I was hoping to see that... But then she dropped the line: "It doesn't even taste that nice," and showed no signs of intoxication. Rather than having a tough body, she probably just gained 'Poison Resistance'.

"That's your lack of experience talking," Rimuru retorted. "I also thought that beer wasn't all that nice in the beginning. But then I started frequenting a small pub after work... One ought to get a glass of beer after work---I just gradually fell into that mindset."

"Hmm, is that so? I've only drunken warm beer around here, and wine tastes sour so I really find them both pretty average."

"That's because you've got a kid's sense of taste. Okay, I concede that warm beer is bland, but good wines are out there. Like the ones served during Walpurgis, it was surprisingly tasty---"

Of course they were; whatever got served there had to be approved by Guy. Hence it would be unthinkable for something not to be exquisite.

"Is that so?" Hinata looked skeptical. "But how would I know if that's true without tasting it myself?"

"I suppose that's how it works. However, that luxurious stuff won't come so easily. Or rather, for Hinata-chan who's got a kid's tongue, here's probably a drink better suited for you."

"You've been going on and on about the whole "kid's tongue" thing from just now, are you looking down on me?"

"No, *most certainly not*, lady."

Hinata glared at Rimuru, who'd prepared a fragrant fruit liqueur. Something resembling juice---or so I thought; on second glance I discovered that it actually had a remarkably high alcohol content.

"How dare you give me drinks for kids---eh? This is pretty good."

And with clever phrasing, Rimuru was able to recommend another drink to Hinata. Hinata, who'd been kept in a loop, got tricked by the sweet flavor and started to get drunk soon enough. Unlike her usual strict self, she showed signs of getting tipsy on her reddening face.

*Are you a genius?!!*---I was deeply shocked by Rimuru's strategizing side. He cleverly got Hinata to dance in the palm of his hand.

Perhaps it was because I had lowered my guard out of respect for Rimuru, that I reached out to the dishes in front of me with my bare hands. I completely forgot about the chopstick business and simply grabbed the food with my fingers. I was astonished, immediately turning my attention from Rimuru and Hinata to the dishes. The crispy taste accompanied by a thick and lasting scrumptious flavor that spread throughout my mouth after one bite. *Is this what they call Tempura?* It was truly tasty for a first try. And they had prepared napkins, so I needed not mind dirtying my fingers.

I was satisfied with such a long-overdue dinning of fine food and reached out for my glass. I wanted to try the fruity drink Hinata just tasted.

Now I saw why it was so tasty. Its aroma was uncanny, a sweetness that spread in your mouth as you took a sip. It became obvious to me they had not spared the use of honey and sugar in making it.

"Luminas-sama, I also recommend this one," said the kijin named Shuna, as she handed me a clear glass.

"Hmm, then I shall taste it."

"Very well," she poured some mouthwatering, colorless fluid into it. A fragrance reminiscent of the gifts of the forest filled the air around me. What a unique scent... I swallowed my saliva and carefully maintained my elegant behavior, then passed the glass to my mouth.

"This is delicious!"

It was neither sweet nor bitter. A pure and elegant taste.

"Your kind words are greatly appreciated. There is an abundant supply of it, please help yourself to any amount you desire."

"Hmm, I shall do just that," I responded with glee.

I had not expected that a newly appointed demon lord could have provided such a comprehensive reception. And somehow without prior contact, they had managed to prepare such a feast...

In other words, they had always been leading such a comfortable life.

I thought about it as I devoured the last of the delicious food and drink.

![break]

"Are our meals to your taste?"

"Hmm, very much so. The dishes and drinks are all spectacular."

Rimuru came to make small talk with me.

"That's great. However, you should probably know your limit, or it would be harmful for your health."

"Stop being silly. No poison can affect me, so how would I ever lose to alcohol. Or rather, I have to weaken my poison resistance in order to get intoxicated."

I was rather delighted having been able to speak my mind without the need for courtesy. That may have been why I wasn't stingy about teaching Rimuru the secret of controlling his Skills.^[Rimuru gets drunk in vol 8 using this knowledge.]

![soft scene break]

Just like that, I was able to build an alliance with Rimuru as well as have a friendly relationship.

But that's just where the problem begins. The future I'd heard of had been drastically altered from the current situation as of now.

Rimuru shouldn't have become a demon lord and Farmus should have survived. The Holy Empire of Lubelius shouldn't have forged an alliance with the Jura-Tempest Federation, only to the extent that Hinata was an acquaintance of Rimuru.

And then, in many years, when the Eastern Empire began its invasion, Rimuru would be murdered. As a result, the sealed Veldora would be resurrected, and I, along with whoever remained, would risk our lives to challenge the unleashed, berserk Veldora---or so it should have been.

Right now, everything was different. So, whatever happened next became more difficult to predict.

However, however...

There was one thing I was sure of. Hinata was still around and she got to know Rimuru. It wouldn't take long before I got to meet Chloe again this way.

![break]

My prediction was right.

Chloe had already visited this world, and I was able to meet her again during the Founding Festival. Though Chloe didn't remember me---or I should say, pretended to not know me. Although I couldn't bear to wait, it couldn't be helped.

I really wanted to hug Chloe tight as soon as possible, but that had to wait. Compared to that, a more pressing matter would be the impending judgement day. This was a future that had derailed from its original course.

Seeing Veldora being tamed by Rimuru, I couldn't imagine him going berserk the way he was now. If that were the case, there would probably be disaster of a different kind befalling us. Then I'd have to be cautious with my every move.

![break]

I made up my mind on that closing thought. I would keep my promise. And then---truly reunite with Chloe and Hinata. I'd call Rimuru as well on that occasion. Thinking about it, I was also looking forward to the promised musical exchange with Rimuru.

I'd defy my fate no matter what happened in the near future. Then, I'd put an end to the lonesome days. By that time, it would be my world to reign over. For instance, how about I invite Hinata and Chloe to take a bath together?

I dreamed of such day's arrival. I'd put mirrors all over the bathhouse to surround Hinata and Chloe from every conceivable angle---muhuhuhuhu, I could barely contain myself.

![break]

Since I had made a commitment, it came time to rid myself of all the annoying burdens. Wipe out anyone and anything in my way.

With such resolve, I looked forward to my future paradise.
