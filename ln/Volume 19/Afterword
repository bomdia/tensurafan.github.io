# Afterword

It's been a long time, everyone.

For the first time, the deadline was extended by one month. I thought it was going to be a disaster when I started writing it, but then I felt that it was actually impossible. As I was rearranging the contents for the completion, various developments came to my mind. The reason was that I couldn't write them down easily, because whatever I added would have a big influence on the future.

Of course, I had other work to do as well, and one of the reasons was that I couldn't switch my mindset well. I feel that my brain is not working as well as it used to, and I wonder if it's my age. When I mentioned this to I-San, he gave me a warm encouragement saying, "Don't make excuses like that, just write it down."

I don't get it. He even told me that he would never change the schedule of the next volume, so I will start the next volume as soon as I finish this postscript. Oops, the manuscript still has to be revised before that. Proofreaders are really amazing. They search not only for inconsistencies in the current volume, but also for errors in the entire volume set.

However, with so many volumes, it seems that small discrepancies tend to accumulate. It would be easier if it were just a matter of spelling mistakes or rewriting the text to make it easier to understand. In my case, I started writing with only a rough plot, so I did most of the checking only in my head. I realized that I could only get away with that for a short number of books, and reminded myself to refine the plot before I start writing.

And so, here is the 19th volume.

The last war has broken out, and the forces are locked in a standoff in various places. I cannot write everything in this volume and will continue to the next volume as a matter of course. This is how I would like to run through the remaining three (planned) books!

Michael-san, who was a candidate for the last boss, has left the scene, and I wonder who will become the last boss. I have a vague idea in my head, but whether it will be adopted or not depends on the future. It is quite common for me to change my direction while writing. I will continue to work hard on the story so that readers can enjoy it more!

I hope that you will continue to support That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime.

See you in the next volume!
