# Chapter 3: Reminiscences|of the Clowns

Going back in time.

Kagali, who was taken from the battlefield by Feldway, regained consciousness just as Lieutenant Kondou was killed in battle.

This was the result of being freed from control.

But the current location was a different world that Kagali had no knowledge of.

*What's going on?*

Kagali tried to grasp the situation.

Then she saw a familiar face.

"Dino..."

"Hey! It looks like you're awake, Kazalim. I guess that Kondou guy is dead."

"You, you noticed...I see, so the boss told you."

Kagali was surprised to hear Dino call her by a name she had abandoned, but her gaze wandered to where she found Yuuki.

He was sitting comfortably in his chair, but his expression was blank.

In other words, like Kagali had been, Yuuki was under the control of someone. Kagali instantly realized that it would not be surprising if Yuuki had revealed her true identity.

"Well. I don't know much about what happened to you, but to be honest, I'm more interested in that appearance."

Dino said as such, looking at the current Kagali, who looked nothing like Demon Lord Kazalim.

*He's still so aloof and unpredictable as always*

Kagali thought while releasing her tension.

Actually, Kagali did not have enough fighting ability now. She may be above A rank, but in the eyes of the real monsters, she is a small fry.

Dino's ability was unknown, but it was obvious that she was no match for him.

Therefore, Kagali thought of the best move she could make at the moment.

In other words, she was gathering information.

"So, where are we?"

Dino replied in a cryptic manner.

"Did you notice we're in another world? This is a special place, the place of beginnings, adjacent to all worlds but isolated from them as well: the Heavenly Star Palace."

The name was unfamiliar.

However, it was filled with words of great importance.

*The place of beginnings... No way, the birthplace of Star King Dragon Veldanava?!*

The place of beginnings was said to have existed before the creation of all worlds. It was a folklore that could only be remembered in mythology.

It was said to exist, but no one had ever even seen it.

"How..."

"To get here, you need a 'key' to go through the gate, but I didn't know what it was. But now that I've been brought here, I understand. I'm not going to tell you, though."

Kagali was annoyed but remembered that Dino was a man who did not like to waste time. If he wouldn't tell her now, then he wouldn't tell her anything, no matter what she did.

In that case, all she had to do was ask something else.

"I won't force you, so just answer what you can tell me."

"How troublesome."

"We've known each other a long time, isn't it fine?"

"Che, what's in it for me?"

"I remember doing a lot of work for you, so---"

Before Kagali could finish, Dino straightened up.

"What do you want to know? If I ask you that, you'll forget about the past, right?"

"Yes, of course I will."

Kagali smiled at him.

Dino was still the same. Kagali was relieved to see that, despite the incomprehensible situation.

"Our boss, Yuuki Kagurazaka---why is he still under control? You just said that Kondou is dead---no way?!"

"You're really quick to guess, aren't you? I know you're probably right, so there's no point in saying it, but I'll tell you. You were dominated by Kondou, but Yuuki is being controlled by the same person who lent Kondou the power."

"As I thought..."

It was an unbelievable fact that she didn't want to believe---that there was an entity that could lend someone the power to control others.

However, Dino wouldn't lie like this. He was the type of person who didn't talk if he didn't want to, so his information was more truthful.

Yuuki is being controlled---he has a very specific constitution that nullifies all Skills, but the fact that someone has the power to break through it is scary.

She wanted to get Yuuki back to normal in order to escape from this place, but had no idea how to do that. In that case...

"Where are my cute children?"

"You mean the ones standing behind you?"

Kagali turned around in a panic. There was no sign of them, but that was to be expected.

*I see, so you've become combat dolls (killing mode), that just follow my orders.*

Kagali warned herself that she seemed to be in a hurry even though she thought she was calm. Then, she released the order and returned Teare and Footman to their former selves.

Incidentally, there were also nine unfamiliar undead elves standing in the line, but those were none of Kagali's concern.

---For the time being, she had a vague memory of the time when she was under control.

She remembers being ordered to use the forbidden spell 'Dead Birthday,' so they must have been created by that. However, it was not Kagali's will, and she had no attachment to those she created.

"Oh, Chairman! So you're all right! I was so worried about you!"

"Hooohohoho. Teare is right. Chairman, did the boss help you?"

"No, he didn't. There's no point in hiding it, so I'll tell you right now---this situation is the worst," Kagali said, informing them of the current situation.

Dino didn't care that he was being ignored and fell asleep.

"I see, it's because we're not good enough, isn't it?"

"That's not true, Teare. Even the boss was dominated, so I'm sure we wouldn't be able to resist no matter how much we struggled."

"Then what are you going to do? Are you going to obey?"

"Since there are no guards, can't we escape?"

Footman asks and Teare gives her opinion.

Kagali's expression is dark as she answers.

"That's the problem. As much as I'd like to escape, we're talking about the 'Heavenly Star Palace' which is in another world. You can't escape using magic."

Actually, Kagali had already tried the elemental magic: 'Warp Portal.' If there had been any sign of success, she had intended to take Teare, Footman, and Yuuki and escape.

However, since the coordinates of the current location were unknown, the spell did not work.

*It was fortunate that I was able to break free from the control, but it was clear to them that I wouldn't be able to do anything with just that anyways...*

It's a shame, but that's the truth.

Sure, there were no guards, but that was only because Kagali and the others were believed to be unable to escape.

"Dino."

"Huh, oh. What, just when people are about to take a nice nap. You still have questions?"

"I don't suppose you could answer them, but is there any way we can get out of here?"

"Do you think there is?"

"...No."

"Right? I've always appreciated your quick thinking. So you'd better stop wasting your time and keep quiet."

The result was as expected, but still a stalemate.

The 'Heavenly Star Palace' is a very small flat world. It exists within the inner surface of a sphere, with the lower half being the earth and the upper half being the sky.

It is less than a hundred square kilometers in size, has only a temperate climate with no four seasons, and includes a beautiful chalk castle.

But that was perfect.

The flowers did not wither, the fruit did not rot, the water was clean, and the earth was moist. Therefore, there were always fields of flowers in full bloom, and the sparse trees bore sweet and fragrant heavenly fruits.

In this world where time seemed to have stopped, there was no sense of change.

Kagali and the others were waiting in the garden in a gazebo. From there, they could see the whole castle and, on the other side, the huge gate at the edge of the world.

There was no sign of anyone coming out of the castle.

But with the gates closed, it seemed clear that escape from this world was impossible.

Therefore, Kagali was not discouraged by Dino's answer and instead tried to calmly think of a countermeasure. However, someone came out of the castle to interrupt her.


![soft scene break]


He was a man with a muscular physique and a fearless face.

He seemed to be emitting a gushing spirit from his body, which indicated that he was very strong.

"Dino-sama, I am troubled. How can a man of your stature be so friendly to such a group of people?"

The man looked down on Kagali and the others in a very natural manner.

Kagali was annoyed by this person but put up with it for the time being. She had a cautious personality.

"Gnome, wasn't it? From the looks of it, it seems you've successfully incarnated."

"Yes! The body of a man named Vega was a very good catalyst. His regenerative powers are high, and at this rate, I'm sure the others and Dhalis-sama will be able to incarnate as well."

"That's good to know."

Dino replied, looking uninterested.

Kagali, unaware of the situation, listened to the conversation in silence.

Vega was definitely the 'Vega the Power, one of the heads (leaders) of Cerberus. In Kagali's vague memory, there was a scene of them coming to this place together.

*Vega as a catalyst? Perhaps as a substitute for incarnation? No, that's certainly possible. That man inherited the blood one of Rosso's research achievements, 'Magic Inquisitor.' He is both monster and human, and can recover from any injury as long as he's fed.*

In other words, he would regenerate even if its arms were cut off, and in fact, there was even an experimental result that had shown that he would revive as long as his head was left.

This is where the horrifying part came in---even the parts of the body that had been cut off would attempt to return to human form as a monster with no sense of self.

That was why Yuuki had strictly ordered Vega to collect his limbs if they were ever cut off.

But...

It seems that this Gnome guy took advantage of Vega's traits to obtain a hollow body.

*Why did he need a body in the first place? What is his true identity? Does it mean he needs to incarnate, like a demon? No, judging from this divine presence, he's an angel. That would certainly be more powerful than possessing a human or a monster.*

Kagali thinks fast.

She's lost most of her fighting ability, but her mind is still intact.

And she had come to a rough conclusion.

This man, Gnome, is an angel---or some kind of spiritual life form. And he incarnated in order to invade the earth.

Vega is being used as a catalyst to create flesh. He may be alive, but he is not in a position to move.

This was mostly correct, except that Gnome's race was a phantom.

He had strengthened his pseudomorphic body with magicule by fusing them with Vega's cells. In this way, Gnome had succeeded in complete incarnation by incorporating the substance.

The substances taken in were proteins and carbohydrates collected from the ground. In other words, all he had to do was eat. It was a different method from that of undead elf, but it was more convenient for Gnome, who was a semi-mental life form.

By the way, this Gnome is one of Zalario's subordinates. He had been left out of the attack on Ramiris' labyrinth and had been staying at home.

Then Feldway returned with Vega and the others, and ordered Gnome to incarnate. Zalario and his group returned in a timely manner and met with Dino and the rest.

With the success of Gnome as an experiment, the others began to incarnate. That is why Gnome was the first one to come out.

Gnome, a former Throne Angel, is now a high-ranking subordinate "general" level phantom. Because of his successful incarnation, he was now able to exert more power than the Demon Lord Seed.

From Gnome's perspective, Kagali, who was almost the same as a human, was nothing more than a speck of dust.

Therefore, naturally, he would speak as one who was superior to them.

"Kagali, right? You're just tools to increase our strength. You seem to have regained your free will after the death of Kondou, who was more or less a useful tool, but don't get carried away. Dino-sama here is nothing like you!"

"Hey, stop it right there."

"No, Dino-sama! Dino-sama is one of the great 'Seven Primordial Angels!' It is too merciful of you to speak so casually with these people!"

"That's why I'm saying that Kazalim and I are old acquaintances."

"My name is Kagali now. Can you call me that from now on?"

"I'd say it's a pain in the ass to remember, but it's nice that the name has been shortened. All right, Kagali."

Unlike her previous incarnation as a man, Kagali is now a beautiful woman. The name change didn't feel out of place, and Dino accepted it easily.

Ignoring Gnome, Dino and Kagali continued their friendly conversation...but this irritated Gnome.

Gnome's master is a former cherub named Dhalis. A noble man with great fighting skills, he was Zalario's second-in-command.

But even Dhalis cannot match up to the supreme beings, the Primordials.

They did not receive their names only recently, like Gnome did.

They were created and named by the god Veldanava himself. They were the great seraphim who had been destroying demons since the very beginning.

To Gnome, they were like gods, and Kagali's attitude was unbearable.

Even if Dino himself allowed it, it would affect Zalario's 'status' if left unchecked. Thinking so, Gnome finally decided to use force.

"I told you not to get carried away!!"

He fired a mass of spiritual energy (Tenkoudan) at Kagali, who was sitting on a chair.

Dino did not move.

Because he didn't have to.

"Hooohohoho. Is the long story over? Even so, you're the one who's being rude to the Chairman!"

"Yeah, yeah, that's right! Do it, Footman!"

Kagali's dear companions and loyal clowns are ready to take on Gnome---


![soft scene break]


The battle had become one-sided and fierce.

Gnome was originally a phantom that had been at war with the insectars as a force under Zalario's command.

Although he had just gained a physical body, he did not feel any discomfort. On the contrary, his fighting ability had increased.

His existence value exceeded one million. On top of that, in order to fill up his empty body, the magicule count was currently increasing.

Against Gnome, who is in great shape, was Footman, who had a higher fighting ability than Clayman.

His intelligence is low, but his power was unmatched. His existence value had reached 1.3 million, and now that the restriction had been lifted, his power was incomparable to when he had fought Geld.

"Boom!!"

Footman punched Gnome while shouting this.

"Gupaah?!"

Gnome's face caved in, and he was blown away.

"Hohoho. I'm coming for you!"

He chased after Gnome with no regard for him and hit and hit and hit.

He grabbed Gnome's foot, swung him around and threw him into the air, causing Footman to also jump. He bounced back, gained momentum, and used his own body like a cannonball to plunge into Gnome's back.

"GOBOO---!"

He then grabbed Gnome and slammed him into the ground. Footman's entire weight was also on top of Gnome's back, adding to the momentum crushing him into the earth.

Although Footman is not very intelligent, he has a good sense of combat. If Gnome had gotten Vega's cells, he would regenerate after being torn or injured. He instinctively knew that such attacks were meaningless, so he fought by accumulating damage and depriving him of stamina.

Gnome was puzzled by Footman, who was much stronger than he had imagined.

*H-How can this be?! How can I, a phantom general, be inferior to this unknown person?!*

The incarnation had greatly increased his fighting ability, and yet, he was losing to him.

Gnome was baffled by this fact.

"What, what are you---?!"

"Me? I'm Footman. I'm a Moderate Clown Troupe member, Footman the 'Angry Pierrot.' Pleased to make your acquaintance!"

Footman bowed condescendingly and announced his name politely.

This relaxed attitude struck a nerve with Gnome.

And then there was Teare.

"I'll say my name too! I'm Teare. Teare the 'Teardrop,' of the Moderate Clown Troupe! After Footman, you'll have to play with me!"

She was saying it in a cute way, but was not hiding her evil intentions.

Although not as powerful as Footman, Teare was also quite strong. Her existence value was a little over a million, and her Unique Skill was a vicious trump card.

It wouldn't work now. However, if Footman was defeated, then Teare would come into her own.

Looking forward to that time, Teare continued to watch over Footman's battle.

Once again, Footman's onslaught has begun.

Punching, kicking, and slamming. Like a cat shaking a mouse, Footman is hunting down Gnome.

Gnome is getting impatient.

Footman and Teare laugh at him.

Kagali, who was watching over them, was analyzing the situation calmly.

*It's the worst. There is no future for us if we continue like this. Even if we win this battle, Gnome seems to be a low-level member. We have Teare, but even that doesn't seem like it would help.*

Kagali glanced at Yuuki.

*I don't think Teare can win against an opponent that Yuuki-sama couldn't defeat...*

Besides, angels and demons cannot be physically destroyed. Unless one uses a special skill, they will come back to life even if Gnome was killed here.

As soon as he took in Vega's cells, he became physically unable to die. Moreover, there was a high probability of resurrection even after death, so the battle itself seemed pointless.

After all, defeat was guaranteed. Knowing this, Kagali felt like a fool.

"Stop it, Footman. That's enough playing around."

"Huh? Are you sure, Chairman?"

"Yes. We can't escape from here anyway. Not unless we can destroy that big gate, but that seems impossible no matter what."

If Dino's words were to be believed, then this was a closed-off world called the 'Heavenly Star Palace.' They needed a key to get through the gate, and Kagali and the others had no way to obtain it.

It was a dead end.

Seeing Kagali, Gnome laughed loudly.

"Hah! Hahahaha! That's right. If you understand that much, then we can make this quick. All you have to do is work as hard as you can as a tool. If you do, I'll take good care of you as a capable subordinate."

Seeing that Footman had stopped moving, Gnome understood the situation. It was unexpected that he couldn't defeat Footman, but Kagali, his master, was clever.

As long as he could control their master, Footman and Teare would be nothing but puppets. If so, Gnome's superiority would be preserved.

Thinking this, Gnome regained his composure, but the next moment, he was frightened by the overwhelming presence of death that surrounded him.

"How unsightly, Gnome. It was a mistake to give you a name."

Before he knew it, the great gate had opened, revealing three figures.

One of them, a striking beauty with long jet-black hair that looked as if it was studded with stars in the night sky, was Zalario, the leader of the "Three Phantom Commanders."

![full page image](image8)

When Zalario returned, he had hidden himself and had watched Gnome's words and actions. He was dismayed and disappointed by the fecklessness of the situation.

His companions, Pico and Gracia, walked towards Dino, away from Zalario.

"Yo, good work."

"Ah. I'm tired from work, is there a dispute?"

"Hey, hey, what's going on?"

They asked in hushed tones, but Dino just shrugged and said, 'You'll see.' Pico and Gracia turned to Gnome, noticing that he didn't want to explain.

"Za-Zalario-sama?!"

"Don't say my name, it's dirty."

"N-no way! Please wait. This is a misunderstanding---"

"You are the one who is misunderstanding. My word is justice. Therefore, there is no misunderstanding."

"Th-that's..."

Saying yes would be admitting his mistake. But denying it would mean to antagonize Zalario.

Gnome was in an instant danger, but there was no way out of this situation.

"Compared to you, no, it's a bit rude to compare. Feldway's find is more useful to me than you."

Zalario's words were plain and matter-of-fact, devoid of any flicker of emotion. However, Gnome sensed something ominous in his voice, and desperately spoke up.

"Please wait---"

But it was all too late.

The noble Zalario hates fools.

"Your sin is that you misjudged your own worth. Considering the years you have served me, I will forgive you just by erasing that 'personality^[The word is "Jinkaku (人格)" refers to the 'personality' and 'character' someone has, but it also means the 'individuality' of that person. It is essentially a person's 'sense of self.'].'"

Zalario said cruelly.

*Erasing your 'personality'?!*

Kagali was shocked.

"No way! N-no, no. Forgive me, please forgive me, Za---"

Zalario would not allow Gnome to call his name.

Heavenly Punishment Roaring Thunder, "Jupiter."^["Tenbatsu Todoroki Kaminari (Jupiter)"]

A ray of lightning flashed from Zalario's fingertips.

The divine scorpion burned Gnome.

And yet, his body was left intact. However, his mind had been initialized with a catastrophic amount of information and was overwritten with a new 'personality.'

It was a broken power.

Zalario hadn't even been serious in Ramiris' labyrinth.

And Kagali, who had witnessed such power, knew that the situation was hopeless.

*It's impossible. He is not a fightable opponent. I thought Dino was trouble, but this guy...he's in the same class as Guy and Milim...it's a whole other level.*

It was a whole other dimension.

So Kagali gave up all resistance.

"So, what happens to me?"

Kagali asked openly.

If she was going to be punished, she would at least keep her pride intact until the end.

"Nothing at all. Though I'm not going to apologize for the trouble Gnome has caused you."

"Eh?"

Kagali was perplexed by the casualness of the conversation.

From Zalario's point of view, he was telling the truth.

It was Lieutenant Kondou who had picked Kagali up, but it had been Feldway's decision. It was Feldway's will to use the power that Michael had given him to create bodies for incarnation.

This was successfully accomplished, and although there were only nine of them, they were wonderfully prepared.

The transcendent beings, Zalario and the others, needed to select the bodies to incarnate. As with their current temporary bodies, mere humans and monsters would not be able to withstand their power and would disintegrate.

This was similar to the situation where primordials competed with each other for incarnation.

The fact that they could not easily manifest in the material world also made it difficult for them to carry out their invasion strategy.

Kagali conveniently existed in this situation, and the idea of using undead elves as an elementary body emerged. They had to try it out but could say that the result was good.

The idea of using Vega had also been adopted as an alternative, but the result was Gnome running out of control, and Zalario judged it to be a failure because it seemed to affect his personality.

In comparison, undead elves did not have free will. The power of an undead elf had been proven by Footman, and he judged that it would be enough to withstand Zalario's possession.

"But I reject the idea of using this Vega guy. Gnome was a more cautious man, but I can't help but think it would have had a strange effect."

Zalario muttered to no one in particular, but Kagali listened and thought about it. Then, without thinking, she opened her mouth to answer when she didn't have to.

"Vega is greedy. Befitting of a position that symbolizes Power, he takes in every desire he can and makes it his own."

"Hoh?"

'Oh, no,' she thought, but it was too late.

Faced with the silent pressure to continue, she proceeded to state her reasoning.

"Vega is pure. He obeys the strong and eats the weak. He's a vile character, but he has his own beliefs. That's why he's strong."

He doesn't take it personally when he loses, and he'll stoop to any level if he thinks he can't win. He believes that as long as he can survive and make it to the next level, he will win.

That is why Vega had never felt defeated. He believed that anyone who overlooked him was an idiot, and that he should pay them back one day when he is able to win.

That is how Kagali evaluated Vega.

*Although Yuuki-sama is superior in terms of greed.*

After seeing through Vega's character, he had made good use of it. Kagali also admired Yuuki's strength.

"I see. So you're saying that it's possible that such a greedy nature has permeated every single cell of Vega?"

Kagali, who had thought she hadn't explained it well enough, nodded at Zalario's accurate point.

"Exactly. That's why I honestly don't recommend growing and using his cells."

"I'll keep that in mind."

Zalario said, turning his attention back to the castle.

"I see...That thing is definitely useless. You follow me."

"Eh?"

Despite asking, Zalario was already quickly heading towards the castle. Gnome, whose presence had become scarce, naturally followed Zalario.

Kagali wondered for a moment what to do, but then decided that it would not be wise to disobey.

"You two, follow me."

"Yes, sir."

"Yes!"

Kagali followed Zalario, taking Footman and Teare with her. Then, as if it were natural, Yuuki followed Kagali.

![break]

Only Dino and three others were left.

"What are we going to do?"

"This has nothing to do with us, so we can't do anything about it."

"Right."

"I think that's the point. Pico, don't be too accommodating to Dino. If you don't, I'll be the one who gets in trouble."

"Yes."

"Hey, come on, you're making it sound like I'm no good, aren't you?"

"You're no good."

"You're a bad angel. A fallen angel!"

"Idiot! You think you're so smart, shut up!"

Such was the exchange between the three of them in the empty room.


![soft scene break]


Kagali was impressed by the grandeur of the castle as she entered.

The castle that she had given to Clayman was a reminder that she had not yet achieved the level of luxury she had hoped for. The royal castle she had lived in so long ago seemed so shabby compared to this.

"It's wonderful."

"Of course it is. This castle is where Veldanava-sama resides."

Not expecting a response, Kagali changed her opinion of Zalario.

It seems that he is surprisingly conversant.

While she was thinking about this, they arrived at their destination.

It was a room with two large culture tanks.

It had the appearance of a laboratory.

There were five men and five women surrounding one of the culture tanks.

Floating in the middle of them was something in the shape of a person.

Upon closer inspection, it resembled Vega.

Noticing Zalario's presence, everyone turned around and bowed.

A man greeted them on behalf of the group.

"Zalario-sama, welcome back."

The man's name was Dhalis.

Strictly speaking, phantoms had no gender, but he was a confidant who had served Zalario as a man since the original cherub era.

Zalario nodded lightly and told him the matter at hand.

"The plan is canceled."

"Understood."

Dhalis didn't ask why. He believed that whatever Zalario said was right, and that they should just follow him.

This was the reason why the angelic ego was regarded as weak. That is why they were so easily influenced by the encroachment of Vega.

"I have given you a name, but it may have been meaningless."

"I'm sorry, sir. Am I in any way at fault here?"

"No, you are not at fault. It's just that I expected too much."

Zalario would do his best, but he did not expect every result to be perfect. He was working to accurately evaluate the confirmed results and apply them to the future.

Therefore, no matter what the outcome, his emotions would not be shaken.

Dhalis was afraid of Zalario's disappointment.

So, despite his regrets, he followed Zalario's words.

He ordered his subordinates, Gnome and Berne^["ベルン," or "Berne." It might also be "Bern" or "Berun" or "Vern" depending on how you hear it.], to stop the incubator.

Nice, who is the equal of Dhalis, had no objections and had her subordinates, Bem^["ベム," or "Bem." It can also be pronounced "Bemu." This is similar, but a different name from Bern.] and Sun, help her.

Incidentally, Dhalis was male and Nice was female.

The others, like Gnome, were former throne angels, so they did not have a definite gender. However, as Zalario said, they had recently acquired "names," and their personalities had become distinctive. This had given them their individuality, but it was still developing.

It seems that one of the subordinates of the "Three Phantom Commanders" Cornu, who was the same rank as Zalario, was possessed by a native of the invaded area and lost the initiative. It is believed that this was due to a weak ego, and as a countermeasure, only the former angelic leaders were given names.

However, several decades had passed since then, and Zalario believed that even then, the changes were so slight that no further growth could be expected.

That was why he was looking for suitable mediums for possession.

*---I had thought the idea of cultivating Vega's body was a good one, but the cells themselves were covered with evil. In that case, there is no choice but to use the undead elves that were created...*

There were nine of them.

That was enough for the current leaders.

However, Feldway was planning to ask Michael to use the 'Army of Angels, Armageddon' to further increase his strength. The plan was not to summon countless angels, but to concentrate his energy to create several pillars of seraphim.

That's what the undead elves are for.

Zalario's subordinates, even his confidant Dhalis, were only second in rank. The undead elf should have been used only for the seraphim, in order to gather a large and unshakable force.

*Oh well. We don't know how many pillars we can summon, so there's no rush. I'll talk to Feldway about this later.*

Zalario thought about it and was about to leave the place.

But then, he heard the sound of shattering glass.

The culture tank had been destroyed.

"Wait! I'll never forgive you for ripping my arm off! It's you, I'll get it back!!"

With the device shut down, Vega woke up and began to move.

And his target was Gnome, who had fused with Vega's cells.

"Gubuh, gugugu---gupah..."

Before anyone could stop him, Vega's arm grabbed Gnome. Then the fusion began, and Gnome was absorbed by Vega.

"Oh, that's delicious! My power is getting stronger!!"

Vega was delighted.

He sensed that the Gnome guy he had absorbed had a huge amount of magicules, and that it had boosted his strength.

"Kukakakakaka! This guy is good. Now, I can take any bastard I want---Uh?!"

Vega's climax ended the moment he locked eyes with Zalario.

"I've heard a lot about you. You can either join us, or you can stay here and fight."

Vega was asked this question, but he already knew his answer.

"Heh, sorry. I got carried away. Of course, I'll follow you."

That kind of filthiness was quite impressive at this point.

Zalario was not dismayed, as this attitude was within expectations. He knew it, and accepted it.

The loss of Gnome was unfortunate, but it did help to strengthen Vega.

What was needed for the future battles was not an army, but individual heroes. The more powerful allies they had, the better.

Besides, Gnome had just lost his ego, so his value as a pawn had diminished. In fact, it was better for him to become Vega's ally here.

Zalario was cruel and ruthless to his subordinates who had served him since long ago, but that was just his true nature.

The others had no problem with it as long as it was Zalario's decision.

Vega's outburst was forgiven, and he was treated as one of them.

![break]

Kagali, who was watching the whole thing, could not help but feel disgusted.

Vega's attitude was horrible, but it was hard to understand what kind of thought process Zalario had, who had tolerated it so easily.

She couldn't read Zalario's thoughts because he didn't seem to be similar to Yuuki.

Yuuki was well aware of the dangers of Vega and handled him well. But Zalario---

*Zalario, on the other hand, probably doesn't even think Vega is dangerous. Does that mean he is that much more capable?*

Kagali judged that from the situation, she was correct.

Zalario did not even care about the current Vega. Even his own subordinates were only slightly useful tools.

But this was not arrogance.

It was not arrogance, because Zalario's perception was correct.

Zalario's nature of grasping information correctly was far from arrogance. Kagali, however, could not possibly understand such a thing, and was left confused.

"Hey, Kagali, isn't it? And Yuuki wasn't like that either. Well, we're old friends, so let's get along."

Kagali was noticed by Vega who called out to her.

There's no way that the current Kagali can beat Vega. Besides, even if Teare and Footman had challenged Vega, the odds would have been about 50-50. Since Yuuki was still deprived of his free will, she decided that it would be best to just stay in line.

"Right. Our circumstances have changed a lot, so let's continue to get along."

"Oh, yeah. Anyway, where am I? Where are we?"

"It's called the 'Heavenly Star Palace.' It looks like there's no way to escape, so we'll just have to obey those people."

"I see. Well, I don't need to run away. I'm sure they'll need my help anyway, so I'll just enjoy the situation."

Kagali envied Vega's simplicity.

Zalario didn't seem to like it, but the intentions of those controlling Yuuki were unknown.

Kagali thought that the Dead Birthday spell would be a trump card for her and the others, but she was not sure about that, either.

In the first place, a ritual that required tens of thousands of corpses was not something that could be easily handled.

*We need to make them think we're useful somehow. If worse comes to worst, we'll survive even if we have to flatter them.*

Kagali thought as such.

It was out of the question to abandon their ambitions after all this time. She had decided that now was the time for surrender, and was ready to throw away her pride.

And that resolve would soon be put to the test.

Michael and Feldway had returned.


![soft scene break]


In the center of the castle, there was an audience hall.

There was no one on the throne. It had been empty for a long time.

Chairs were arranged in the hall, and people were sitting as they pleased.

Michael was seated in the chair closest to the throne. Standing next to him was Feldway, staring at the gathered people.

In addition to Zalario and the others, Kagali's group was also there.

Dino and his group came without skipping a beat.

The newborn undead elves had also been brought there.

And that wasn't all.

Obera and her confidant from the Palace of Monsters had also been summoned.

Obera had only one confidant, named Oma.

The others were killed in the battle against the cryptids. As you can see from this, Obera is the one who was in charge of the toughest battlefield.

Oma had lost both her eyes when she became a youma^["妖魔." Possible translations are demon or ghost or apparition.], but instead she had a single eye that could see everything. Her mouth had been sewn shut, and she communicated only by 'telepathy,' not with words.

Despite her eerie appearance, she was a former cherub and a veteran warrior who had followed Obera for a long time.

Obera and the others were not the only ones Feldway brought.

There was the Insectar, with whom he had fought for what seemed like an eternity, and with whom he was now in an alliance with.

Insect Lord Zelanus, and the Twelve Insect Generals, who were his confidants, had gathered together.

However, there were only eight of them now, not twelve.

One of the missing members was Razul, the guardian god of the West. He invaded the Cardinal World more than two thousand years ago under the command of Zelanus, but betrayed him and became an ally of the Chosen Hero Granbell. He was a bug-type majin (insectar) who had been defeated by Shion and Ranga.

The other was Minaza., who was sent by Zelanus to help Emperor Rudra after he was promised half the world. He had also been defeated by Shion, though by a strange coincidence.

There other two were escaped larvae born of the replacement. One of them was also a direct descendant of Zelanus, so a secret search order had been issued...It was still missing.

Each of the eight currently present, like Razul and Minaza, had a fighting ability comparable to that of an awakened demon lord.

Among them, Zess, a direct descendant of Zelanus and the commander of the bug-generals, boasted a strength that set him apart from the others. He was Zalario's rival, and they had competed with each other to the death.

The strength of the remaining seven was on a par with the others.

Beathop, who had the characteristics of a bee and a grasshopper.

Mujika, who looked like an anthropomorphic centipede.

Tishorn who was like a mantis.

Torun, a dragonfly with wings.

Abart, with spider-like limbs on his back.

Saril, a venomous scorpion.

Peliod, beautiful as a damselfly.

All of them with their own peculiarities were standing in silence, not even sitting on chairs.

It was a large room, but the oppressive feeling made it seem smaller.

Kagali was afraid, but decided to let things happen as they would.

![break]

After everyone had been assembled, the meeting with Michael began.

"Gentlemen. With Rudra gone, Michael-sama is free. And as a first step towards Veldanava-sama's resurrection, we have succeeded in expelling Velgrynd. The plan is now---"

At that moment, Zalario stepped forward to speak. Normally, he would not interrupt his superior Feldway, but this time he decided that it was urgent.

"Feldway-sama, please hold. It seems that there is a difference in perception."

Feldway was in a good mood, but his smile disappeared at Zalario's words.

"What?"

He became a little sullen and asked.

"Velgrynd is alive and well. And because of her, Cornu has been destroyed."

" " "...?!" " "

Even Zelanus twitched at this remark.

Feldway frowned in displeasure.

The Demon Lord Rimuru was an annoying new interloper, but the plan had gone well. Guy Crimson and Rimuru Tempest would both be obstacles, but Veldanava's resurrection was still imminent.

Of the three remaining "True Dragons" on Earth, Velgrynd's dragon factor had been obtained, and he was ready to obtain the other two.

However, if Zalario's words were true, it meant that there would be a major deviation from the plan.

And, as if to confirm his words, Cornu's presence had disappeared. His presence was nowhere to be found, neither here at the 'Heavenly Star Palace,' nor in the Palace of Monsters in the Otherworld.

"Are you sure?"

"It's true. Because of Cornu's disappearance, the plan failed. We had no choice but to retreat. I didn't think your plan would fail, but I guess the blame lies with your ineptitude, right?"

It was Dino, not Zalario, who answered. Dino was more tactful than Zalario in that he even shifted the blame for the failure of the plan.

Zalario tacitly accepted it.

He didn't think that Dino's opinion was correct, but he also didn't think it was necessary to deny it. Zalario, who was fair-minded and strict with himself, could be flexible.

With such a reaction from both of them, Feldway had no choice but to stop doubting.

.........

......

...

Unexpectedly, Feldway was in a foul mood.

However, his mind was clear and he quickly devised a countermeasure.

The first thing to do was to secure a 'True Dragon.'

Since the Dragon Factor was essential to Veldanava's resurrection, it was only natural that this would be the first priority.

Fortunately, Velgrynd's dragon factor had already been secured.

Although he hadn't expected to come back to this world, it wasn't the worst situation. Still, it was a rather painful mistake.

*I was careless. I retrieved the skill because it was going to disappear anyway, but as a result, the "control circuit" also disappeared. I banished her to the far side of time and space so that she would not be an enemy even ifs he resurrected, but now I have increased the number of troublesome enemies...*

At that time, Velgrynd had lost most of her power. On top of that, the Dragon Factor had been taken from her, and she was on the verge of disappearing.

That's why Michael retrieved the 'Charity King Raguel,' but there was no way he could have predicted that this would lead to the destruction of Cornu.

*Never mind. As long as Veldanava-sama is resurrected, the rest is not important. Let's leave the Velgrynd matter alone and have Velzard join us first.*

This time, he would careful not to make her disappear, and let her join with some free will. This would help against Velgrynd, and would also help them capture Veldora.

Once they had Velzard in the group, what would they do next?

He had planned to go after Veldora right away, but now needed to reconsider this.

*If we're going to be facing Velgrynd as well, we'd better get our forces up to speed. I thought that Michael and I could handle it, but you can never be too careful.*

Dino had just told him that he wasn't thinking clearly.

That's why Feldway decided to drastically change his original plan.

.........

......

...

"In that case, it seems we need to take immediate action. Let's take Velzard in first. This time, let's not banish her to the far reaches of space-time and instead use her as an ally."

"There is no other choice. It would be more prudent to eliminate as many uncertainties as possible and begin the final ritual once the three True Dragons have been captured."

Michael nodded in agreement with Feldway's words.

Velzard was given the Ultimate Skill 'Patience King Gabriel' by Veldanava. In other words, since the "Control Circuit" was active, she could be added to the team safely and reliably.

The problem was what happened after that.

Michael's eyes scanned over the group.

"I didn't think it was necessary, but we should incarnate them all. That way, we can deal with whatever happens."

"Indeed. Let's leave Veldora for later and finish all possible preparations first."

The conversation between Feldway and Michael progressed, and a conclusion was reached.

In anticipation of this, Zalario made a report.

"On that note, I have something to report."

"What is it?"

"The attempt to incarnate using Vega there has failed. The only surefire way is to possess the undead elf."

"Hmm. So then nine people. It's a little difficult to decide who to incarnate..."

So Feldway pondered.

Here's what Zelanus had to say.

"Do what you want with those undead elves. We don't need them."

In the event of an emergency, the insectars were able to create bodies that looked like solidified magicules. That's why they can enter any world.

While it would be useful to have the undead elves, it was not necessary.

In fact, that is what happened with Minaza.

She took in the materials of that world and incarnated them, and the insectoids she summoned had been confirmed to have the same properties.

This is why while it was difficult to cross worlds, once they had crossed over to another world, they were able to fully exercise their unrivaled power.

This time, the problem of "crossing worlds" had been solved.

It was natural for Zelanus to give in.

If he didn't need to consider his allies, he could choose from among the phantoms.

In that case, the right choice would be to choose the strongest and most useful.

"Zalario and Obera, of the "Three Phantom Commanders," will be chosen. Shall we fill the remaining seven positions with the executives?"

"I have an opinion on that as well."

"You're welcome to speak freely."

"Thank you."

Seeing this, Dino thought to himself, 'Zalario is a serious man, unlike me.'

With permission, Zalario spoke up.

"Unlike us Primordials^["Shigen (始原)," or "Firstborns/Originals.], those below the cherubs are weak-willed. In the other world, they would be able to fight by force, but in the future, I'm afraid that we won't be able to count on them as a fighting force."

"Hmm. Then what do you suggest?"

"Yes. Rather, why don't we leave the race for survival in the hands of nature?"

Zalario had abandoned his subordinates.

As was the case with Cornu's men, they had been taken over by the humans who had possessed them in the other world when they had invaded, and had thus lost their sense of self.

And now, under the influence of Vega's cells, their emotions were running wild. It was unlikely that giving such people a valuable substitute would help them in the coming battle.

"There are still many who stand in our way. Velgrynd, Veldora, and the demon lords are still alive. Even those damned demons will interfere, those tools that do nothing more than follow orders---"

"Not worth it."

"By your will."

In response to Zalario's statement, Feldway nodded, for he too was concerned about the same thing.

*Yes. What matters is the strength of will. If one doesn't have a strong enough desire, giving them an Ultimate Skill is meaningless. To put it another way...*

No matter how strong the ego was, there was no need to worry about betrayal if he gave them the Ultimate Enchantment 'Alternative.'

Feldway looked at Michael, and their gazes met. Apparently, he had another opinion.

"What is your opinion?"

"I was going to call in the seraphim and possess them with the all-powerful 'Army of Angels, Armageddon.'"

"That's fine, but we don't know how many can be called, or what kind of will they'll possess, do we?"

"Seven at most can be called. But whether the seraphim have a will or not is something we won't know until we summon them."

If an undead elf possesses a seraphim, it will be more powerful than an awakened demon lord. However, its strength of will was something to worry about.

As was the case with themselves, it took many years for their egos to be established.

Feldway's conclusion was that a hastily developed force would be useless.

Here is what Zelanus had to say.

"Interesting. If you have any seraphim left over, why don't I or my children eat them?"

"Hmm..."

Feldway thought about this as well.

They were currently in a collaborative relationship because their interests were aligned. As soon as one of them achieved their goals, there was a good chance they'd go back to being adversaries.

He hesitated to reinforce such an opponent, but it would be an effective strategy to ruin the world.

"That'll be put on hold. We'll think about it then."

"Understood. I'm not saying you have to."

The conversation about the seraphim was postponed and they returned to the question of who should incarnate.

"Then, after all, we should use Zalario as a reincarnation."

"Well, that's fine. Feldway is right about eliminating uncertainties."

"No objections."

Thus, both sides agreed.

"We'll go with Zalario's idea. Are you okay with that?"

Feldway asked his group.

It was posed as a question, but the decision was already made. There was no way that Dhalis and the others could argue with him, since they would be considered weak if they objected.

Thus, it was decided that Zalario and the others would possess the undead elves, and at the same time, unleash the wills that resided in their bodies.


![soft scene break]


With the decision made, the incarnation ceremony began.

This time, the incarnation would be performed by Zalario and five of his subordinates. Also Obera and Oma.

Kagali would be in charge of imbuing the undead elf with an ego.

*What are they going to do with the extra one?*

When Kagali wondered this, her eyes met Feldway's.

"It's Kagali, isn't it? Kondou's death seems to have broken your hold, but what are you planning to do about it?"

'This is it,' Kagali braced herself.

"Will you let me go?"

Kagali asked cautiously, unsure of how much was allowed to be said. There was a surprising response.

"After this ritual is over, I don't mind."

"What?"

"If that's the case, your role will be finished once you have created the undead elves as a substitute. You've done enough good, so if you want, I'll send you back to earth."

'No way,' Kagali thought, confused.

At best, she thought she'd be locked up. At worst, she was prepared to be punished.

And yet, she was allowed to escape.

There was no lie in Feldway's words. As such, there was no need for a complicated negotiation.

The difference in power was so obvious that Kagali was of no use to him. Kagali couldn't think of any reason to deceive such a person, so she thought it safe to assume that his words were true.

In that case, Kagali treaded on thin ice as she made her next request.

"Is it possible for you to break Yuuki-sama's control and let us go with him?"

It was Michael who answered that question.

"I can't allow that. Because the 'Ultimate Skill 'Greedy King Mammon' owned by Yuuki Kagurazaka is also beneficial to me."

For Michael, Yuuki's power was of great use, regardless of his personal fighting ability. Therefore, he rejected the idea of releasing him.

Kagali, understanding this, stopped wishing for more.

*What should I do?Is it okay to run away?*

Feldway added on to Kagali.

"If it's just you and the two of them, I can send you all back. However, the Cardinal World will be rough. I hate the people on Earth. Not that I need the death of every living thing to achieve my goal, but it will inevitably be engulfed in flames in a war with those who stand in our way. But that is the punishment. Those whom Veldanava-sama loved have betrayed that love. Sanctions will be necessary."

Kagali felt a chill run down her spine as his words were spoken so plainly.

To be engulfed in flames would mean that the whole world would be affected by the war. In that case, it was hard to say that the place they escaped to would be safe.

Yuuki was still under their control, and if the absolute powerhouses here went on a rampage, there would be no safe place on earth.

'In the first place...' Kagali thought.

*We wanted to create a country where we could live happily, but it would be too vain to hope for that under these circumstances. In this situation, the most important thing is to survive. And to do that, we need power---*

It might have been a foolish decision.

But at the time, it seemed to Kagali that this was the only correct answer.

That's why---she stated what she wished.

"Please give me an undead elf, and hopefully, allow me to carry a seraphim in this body---"

Kagali wished.

She hoped to abandon her fragile body and be reborn as an undead elf. Then, she would take in the seraphim and gain great power.

She needed power.

Because if you have power, nothing more can be taken from you.

Kagali's words had no chance of winning, but no one argued with her.

Dino had a dumbfounded expression, but said nothing.

Zalario and Obera only followed Michael's decision.

And the insectar was indifferent. He was not interested in the weak.

In the midst of these reactions, Michael nodded.

"Hmm, interesting. But I will not tolerate betrayal. If you accept my Ultimate Enchantment, I will grant you your wish."

"I swear I will not betray you. And I will accept your dominion."

The deal was made.

.........

......

...

To make an undead elf develop an ego was equivalent to awakening its original personality.
In some cases, the strongest will prevails, while in other cases, a new ego is born from a mixture of the two.
Even for Kagali, the outcome was unknown. As one could see from Teare and Footman, it was difficult to invoke a targeted personality.
So even Kagali herself had to gamble whether her ego would win or not.

But even so, she knew she had to obtain the power.
So, after awakening the eight egos, she performed an awakening ritual on her own undead elf. After that, she escaped from the homunculus and transferred into the undead elf.

Thus, the ritual ended.
As was expected, the result was---

.........

......

...


Obera awoke. She is a testament to the pride in her heart that her noble will is one that no one can defeat.

As Dhalis was about to awaken, he realized that Zalario had awakened.
He realized that he was wrapped in an armor of flesh and that he could wield great power in the Cardinal World.
There was another person inside him. His name was Torneot, and he was a man of great ambition. He felt that his skills as a warrior had become his own, and he was convinced that Dhalis himself had greatly increased his presence.

Nice awoke. She became stronger under his command, but she was no different. Her powerful ego was still intact.

Grandma awoke. With her indomitable will still intact, she embraced a being with a similar set of sensibilities. Zero, now consumed, became Oma's flesh and blood.

Then Orca-Aria awoke. With Aria's knowledge as a wizard and Orca's strength as a warrior. Their two egos coexisted and they were reborn as a magical warrior. Not a trace of their former selves remained.


Arios woke up, his Unique Skill 'Murderer' was still intact. He had not forgotten the grudge of being killed by Damrada and was resurrected to seek greater strength.

Mai Furuki woke up. She refused to die because she had left her sickly brother behind, not here, but in the world beyond, in the world she was meant to live in. So she vowed to return.

And so, eight people had risen.
Only one remained.

But she was still in a deep sleep...


![soft scene break]


Kagali was dreaming.

It was so, so long ago.

A dream from when she was still Demon Lord Kazalim?

No.

It was a dream from much, much earlier, when she was just a girl.

She can't even remember her name now, but Kagali was a happy princess.

Kagali's country was founded on the site where 'high humans' had built a great civilization. It was a paradise for the elf race, a magical superpower that was flourishing thanks to the flowing rivers, lush forests, rich plains, and the ruins of the ancient magical empire.

But then---her father, the king, suddenly went mad.

Kagali remembered him as a very kind and gentle man.

Even so---

One day, the king who had been praised as the king of the high elves, suddenly changed into a different person. He changed his name, and began to call himself Jahil, the Great Magician.

Her memory of what happened after that was not clear.

Jahil committed tyranny to the utmost.

He exploited his people and sought only his own glory.

He repeated his foolish experiments and created all sorts of nightmares.

Kagali was one of those who had fallen victim to this.

Kagali, a high elf, was stripped of her powers.

She was killed and brought back to life as an undead elf.

At that time, she was given an ugly appearance and the name "Kazalim."

Her beautiful appearance was gone, and she became a cursed figure.

Rotten flesh covered her bones. It was so dry that it did not smell of decay, though perhaps that was for the best.

Few people knew the secret.

Kagali was so grieved that she began to cover herself with a mask.

"Why are you doing this to meee?!"

"Gera-gera-gera-gera! Because it's funny. Be happy. Tens of thousands of people died to bring you back to life! Gera-gera-gera-gera!!"

It was a nightmare.

She didn't know how her father, who was so kind, had become such a fiend. But because it was real, there was no point in lamenting.

"Father! I don't care what you do with me. But please think of the people like you used to---"

"Shut up! Are you ridiculing me as well? My daughter is no good to me after all. I can't afford to make the same mistake as her. I have instilled my loyalty, but you can't be trusted! Kazalim, today you will be a man. Do you understand?"

It was an absolute command.

Kagali's words never reached 'his'^[Not 100% this was right, but it might have temporarily switched to using male pronouns because of Jahil's order. It switched back to female soon after though. In general, I've chosen to stay with the female pronouns whenever it's Kagali's perspective. I can use male ones if it's Kazalim though.] father, Jahil, and the conversation was cut short.

She was lucky that she had not been killed---no, it was only because she had already been killed and turned into a faithful puppet that she had not been discarded to be used as a tool.

It was then that Kagali parted ways with her father.

Then, the nightmare continued.

The glory of the arrogant Jahil, the Great Magician, seemed to know no bounds, but the end eventually came.

The reason for this was his foolish attempt to make a puppet of the Dragon Empress Milim which incurred her wrath.

'Soma,' the super magic capital, fell into ruins overnight.

It was not known whether Jahil was dead or alive.

It was presumed that he was dead, as it was unlikely that he could have survived that flash of light. So Kagali thought more about the people who were important to her than about the dead man.

The maidservants who had always looked after her with kindness.

The knights who followed her after she became a warrior.

Her beloved people who lived happily ever after.

Thinking of those she loved, she invoked the forbidden spell.

The forbidden spell: Dead Birthday---she had already learned the theory of the spell by becoming a test subject herself.

The spell was perfected, and Teare, Footman, and Clayman were born.

They were lovely, sweet children, all named by Kagali.

And in doing so, she learned a fact she did not want to know.

The undead elves created by her spell were not ugly at all. Only Kagali was made ugly on purpose to be so.

That hateful father, King Jahil, had taken away her beauty just to make Kagali suffer.

Even if she knew that, it was already too late for her to do anything.

Kagali's appearance was the result of a curse, and there was no way to restore it.

However, the children that Kagali had created did not leave her alone. They, too, hid their true faces with masks and shared Kagali's suffering.

Kagali was not alone, and the hope for survival grew within her.

The four of them were then joined by the elf tribes that had survived in various places.

![break]

---Let us rebuild our own country once again. And then, create a country where everyone can live happily---

![break]

Kagali secretly made up her mind to do so.

However, that would become a faint and fleeting dream.

The Chaos Dragon attacked and contaminated the land. As a result, all those who adored Kagali were cursed and turned into dark elves.

At that time, Kagali also acted as if she was cursed. Kagali and Teare were able to endure the curse because they were undead elves...but they recognized themselves and lamented that they were different from everyone else.

It was fortunate that she had been hiding her true face with a mask and no one noticed her, but it made her even more sad.

Teare's presence was the only thing that saved her.

After that, Kagali and her friends abandoned their homeland and fled. Even though they had some regrets, they left together.

![break]

They wandered around, and finally found their next safe haven.

When everyone's lives had stabilized, Kagali decided to visit her homeland again.

She needed to recover the treasures she had left behind, but more than anything, she wanted to see her homeland again.

The city had perished, but it still shone beautifully in her memories. She decided that she had to cut off her regrets and use them as food for the future.

And so, she set off, and on her way, she met a man.

"What, you...If you were watching me, you could have helped me, right?"

"Don't be stupid. Someone like me is no match for that evil dragon."

"You're being too modest. From my point of view, you look like trouble enough...Ouch---"

The man's name was Sarion Grimwald---the Chosen Hero who drove away the Chaos Dragon from this land.

Unfortunately, he was dying from mortal combat with the Chaos Dragon.

"Don't push yourself. Now, the restoration magic---"

"It's useless, so don't do it. The Chaos Dragon's attacks are cursed, and my wounds won't heal. I had prepared several means of recovery, but this is how it is."

In fact, Sarion was blown from the chest down, and it was a miracle he was even still alive. The fact that he could afford to laugh despite this, showed that he had a tremendous mental capacity.

"I need you to pass on a message. I'm here to tell you that I defeated Chaos Dragon and died in style just like a Chosen Hero---"

"Huh, what Chosen Hero? Before you die, I have a proposal. With my evil ways, there is a chance you can survive. You may lose your memory, you may end up like this, but are you willing to give it a try?"

With that, Kagali took off her mask.

What he saw was her ugly face. But seeing that, Sarion smiled wryly.

"What's with you? You've got a good point though. If I just died here, Silvia would kill me. Considering that, this offer is the best thing that could happen to me!"

"Are you sure? I'm cursed. I'm willing to do evil rather than be persecuted. If you're a Chosen Hero, I am prepared to become a demon lord and protect everyone. Besides, if you use this evil method, you'll become my puppet, right?"

"I don't care, I don't care, it's interesting. I'm a free man, and I am not going to be easily controlled. Besides, there is always a cause and effect between a Chosen Hero and a demon lord. That's how you and I came to be, isn't it?"

"You're an interesting guy, talking nonsense at this point. Then, you can be my puppet!"

Negotiations were concluded.

Kagali took Sarion's words as a joke, but they were true. And as a result of this whim, Sarion became undead himself and survived.

That was the moment when "Curse Lord" Kazalim and "Wonder Pierrot" Laplace were born.

![break]

Since then, many things had happened.

Securing the dominant territory. The war against humans and demi-humans was fierce, but she overcame persecution and emerged as "Curse Lord" Kazalim.

He was recognized as one of the demon lords, and steadily expanded his power.

He recommended Karion, the Beast Master, and Frey, the Sky Queen, as demon lords, and formed a powerful alliance with them.

Everything was going well.

So much so that he didn't realize that he had grown complacent.

Kagali next set her sights on an up-and-coming man named Leon. The plan was to teach Leon, who called himself a demon lord in the middle of nowhere, a lesson in humility and bring him under control.

The moment she saw him, Kagali felt a pang of jealousy.

This man who called himself a demon lord, Leon, was too beautiful.

She had become disfigured by her demon father, the king. She had been deprived of her gender and had been struggling to live---The appearance of Leon, who was a man, yet more beautiful than a woman, slowed down her thinking, and Kagali made the great mistake of misjudging her opponent's strength.

Kagali lost her body to Leon's blow, and was forced to wander around with only her spiritual body.

It was a miracle that she did not disappear.

She had a grudge.

But more than that, she had a desire.

So Kagali clung to life.

Using what little power she had left as the Curse Lord, she took the time to prepare for her own resurrection.

Then, in a daze, she made one last summoning attempt---unconsciously failing to take over.

Her plan failed and she gained no flesh.

The rest was destroyed.

"Help me. Save me. I don't want to be taken from you. All I want is to live happily with my friends, but why am I alone in this?"

She lamented her misfortune and asked for help, but no one answered her.

Kagali was not alone, but no one helped her.

It was a journey of hardship.

Ideals were far away and Kagali was the leader of the pack.

There was no room for whining, and she had to always look forward.

So Kagali had given up hope of being saved.

The only people she could trust were herself and her beloved friends. That is how she had lived her life.

But that boy---Yuuki Kagurazaka, he---

"All right. You seem to be tired, so rest inside me for now."

"...?!"

Yuuki Kagurazaka reached out to Kagali, who had tried to take his life, and to whom no one had ever saved.

![break]

A few years later---

Kagali spent the next few years resting inside Yuuki, consulting and advising him.

It was fortunate that the Unique Skill 'Schemer' was a skill that could be used by souls alone, but there were still many troublesome opponents.

In particular, a girl named Mariabell Rosso was extremely troublesome.

Yuuki was a genius strategist, and Kagali was confident in his own intelligence. But even with cooperation and scheming of these two, it was extremely difficult to outsmart Mariabell.

They were outmatched in every aspect, including financial and human resources. Even if they gained an organization to free themselves, Mariabell would grasp the right to free it.

"I'll kill her. If we don't get rid of her someday, our plan will fail."

"I'm sure of it. That demon in a girl's skin is the biggest obstacle for us."

A battle in the economic sphere cannot be won or lost based on simple combat ability alone.

She was a child, but was still like that. When Mariabell grew up and became an adult, they would not be able to compete in every aspect.

A few years had passed since the two of them had made such a decision, and a time for change had arrived.

The birth of the mysterious slime, Demon Lord Rimuru---was not it.

Kagali, who had been inside Yuuki, had finally taken on the body of a homunculus.

Yuuki had kept his promise.

Moreover---

*This is my original form.*

Yuuki's kindness made Kagali so happy that she wanted to cry, but she kept a cool expression on her face. She tried to maintain her masculine tone, but Laplace stopped her. He was pretending to be teasing Kagali, but was actually really looking out for her.

"I appreciate it, boss."

Kagali thanked him from the bottom of her heart.

![break]

Now that she had a physical body, Kagali could look forward to delicious meals and desserts.

The cream puffs were especially delicious.

Spending a happy time with friends, laughing. How happy they were!

However, that happiness did not last long.

Clayman was dead.

With the loss of another precious friend, Kagali realized---Kagali and the others realized once again.

For the sake of their own happiness, they must conquer the world.

To become the rulers of this world and lead it correctly.

*Stupid, arrogant, and cute Clayman. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Rest now and watch over us. We will make our ambitions come true.*

Kagali and the others were not on the side of justice, but they were not evil, either.

They were moderate.

That is why they should be able to create a world where everyone can live happily.

Believing this, they continued their activities.

They defeated Mariabell, were exposed by Demon Lord Rimuru, escaped to the Empire, and were taken over by Lieutenant Kondou.

Even Yuuki was also taken over.

Kagali's heart was about to break, but she could not give up now.

"I swear I will not betray you. And I will accept your dominion."

A contract must be fulfilled, and the benefits received must be returned.

So Kagali was willing to use any means necessary.

![break]

And so, Kagali wakes up---

Leaving behind the fragile body of a homunculus and regaining the body of an undead elf, she was stronger and more beautiful than when 'he' was Demon Lord Kazalim.

Thus, nine undead elves were born.

But this was only the beginning.

When Kagali finally awoke, she saw Feldway and the others had brought Velzard back.

Michael intended to take the 'Dragon Factor' from Velzard for further evolution, but before that, he used the 'Army of Angels, Armageddon' to implant in Kagali and the others.

She was determined not to compromise.

The seven seraphim were successfully summoned.

Those who were willing to incarnate were selected from those who were not former angels.

Kagali was naturally chosen as one of them.

The others were Teare, Footman, Vega, Orca-Aria, Arios, and Mai Furuki.

Their bodies were reborn as the tremendous powers clashed within their body.

Thus Kagali and the others, with the exception of Vega, were reborn as "Yōten" (Heavenly Spirits)^[It's pronounced "Yōten." The Chinese character "妖" can mean many things from spirit, to demon/devil, to ghost, etc. and the Chinese character "天" means heaven/sky. So I just temporarily translated as "Heavenly Spirit," until official translators choose something else.].

And so it was that five months had passed since Kagali had arrived at the 'Heavenly Star Palace'---


![soft scene break]


A vast heavenly castle.

Chalk pillars lined up in the audience hall.

The hall was filled with a divine atmosphere.

Angels with pure white wings filled the hall.

They were still without bodies, but were waiting for the time to invade the earth.

Because they had no will, they did not move at all, and because they were as unsteady as sculptures, it created a solemn atmosphere in the audience hall.

In the front row, chairs were lined up, and those who stood out from the rest sat in a circle.

They were Kagali and the others who had been reborn.

They were much more powerful compared to before, and their presence was much stronger.

Michael was about to wake up, so they were called.

When Kagali reawakened with the seraphim in her body, Michael was still asleep.

However, he had not shown up yet, and it seemed that he was behind schedule.

![break]

Kagali, who had time to spare, turned her attention to the angels.

She was told that there was no limit to the number of angels that could be summoned at once, but there was a limit to the total amount of energy. Normally, it would be an army of a million, but this time there were seven seraphim summoned, so the number itself was not large.

However, the quality was high.

The group was composed only of angels of intermediate level and above, with no low-level angels of any kind.

The approximate numbers were 1,000 dominion angels, 3,000 virtue angels, and 6,000 power angels.

Angels that had not incarnated could not display their full power. But even so, even the fighting ability of the power angels was Over A rank. The limit of activity was seven days, but it was enough strength to scorch the earth.

*---But the demon lords would be able to handle it.*

That's what Kagali thought.

"It's not enough. With only this much, it's going to be difficult to take out any of the forces."

Kagali's murmur echoed in the silent hall.

Although she hadn't been expecting an answer, she got one.

"Well. I didn't have any subordinates, but everyone else had strong ones. To be honest, I doubt if I can defeat one of the eight stars (Octagram)."

Kagali turned to look at the speaker.

"I never thought I'd agree with you. Oh, by the way, Dino. I never knew you worked for Feldway-sama, so do you?"

Kagali whispered quietly.

Dino replied matter-of-factly.

"I can't tell you that. I'm a "watcher." The whole point is to keep a low profile. And while I'm at it, let me correct your mistake. I am a former associate of Feldway's, not a subordinate."

Dino had infiltrated the Octagram and was working as a "watcher." His purpose was to monitor the earth.

Dino, Pico, and Gracia, the three Fallen Angels, were sent on a special mission to investigate the human world. By the will of Veldanava, they were charged with monitoring the human race so that it would not be destroyed.

The role of the demon lords, led by Guy, was to rebuke the human race when it grew too much. And to prevent demon lords from going too far, the Chosen Hero existed as a deterrent.

It was Dino's role to investigate whether the causal relationship between demon lords and heroes was working properly.

While Dino attracted attention with his prominent position as a demon lord, Pico and Gracia conducted their investigation without falling into the spotlight. It was also Dino's hidden role to create a cover-up to make it easier for those two to move about.

However, now that Veldanava has not returned, there was no one to report to. Therefore, Dino had been enjoying his free life as a demon lord.

Dino had no intention of hiding that fact as he was openly talking about it.

Kagali wondered why he was even here then. Perhaps it showed on her face, so Gracia answered with a smile.

"He owes Feldway a lot of money, so he can't say no when asked."

Pico followed suit.

"But he can't go back to Demon Lord Rimuru, so he's decided to follow Michael-sama."

No way, Kagali thought.

"Well, I guess that's it."

Dino nodded.

Kagali didn't believe he was following Michael for that reason, but it was ridiculous, and Kagali agreed that it was typical of Dino.

Kagali changed her mind.

"So, what was Demon Lord Rimuru like? I have a grudge against him for killing Clayman, and I'd like to avenge him if I get the chance."

That was a lie.

In reality, she had no grudge against Demon Lord Rimuru.

There was no doubt that they shared a history with each other. However, he had formed an alliance with Yuuki, and even if they were to become enemies again, he was still an interesting presence.

The one to blame for Clayman's death would be Lieutenant Kondou, who had controlled him, and Michael, who had even controlled Kondou.

Kagali calmly understood this, but she was not foolish enough to say it.

Dino answered Kagali's question without going any deeper.

"Even his subordinates are troublesome. Especially that Zegion guy."

In the last mission, Dino's role was to neutralize the labyrinthine forces. Specifically, his mission was to kidnap or eliminate Ramiris.

Dino claims to have come close to succeeding, but the reality is that he failed. The reason, he says, is that he was interrupted by Zegion, a powerful majin.

"Is he that strong?"

"He's not just strong. It was a level that was seriously insane. Rumor has it he's the strongest of the Dungeon's Elite Ten, so he's stronger than me at the least."

Dino affirmed.

He was tired from the long series of battles, and had underestimated his opponent a little. Zegion, on the other hand, did not even take Dino seriously and played him lightly.

Dino's true feelings were that he didn't want to be a sore loser.

"That's a weak thing to say. You can just crush him! Don't worry, I'll crush him myself!"

Vega boasted.

*It must be nice to be so stupid.*

Dino thought, but didn't say it out loud.

There was no point in saying anything.

*Vega is still the same. Like this, even if he has the power, we might not be able to use him effectively...*

Kagali sighed in exasperation.

It was all well and good to be confident in your own strength, but it's no use if you lack the most important sense in battle.

It was the ability to grasp the difference in strength between you and your opponent. Facing an unbeatable opponent will only result in losing strength unnecessarily.

Pico and Gracia seemed to understand this and frowned in displeasure.

They didn't say anything, probably because they were not close to Vega and realized that there was no point in advising him.

That appeared to be the end of the conversation---

"Well, if you guys see an insectar in the labyrinth, be careful, okay? The beetle type is Zegion, but Apito, the bee type, is dangerous too."

Zelanus took a bite out of Dino's casual remark, which was about to conclude the conversation.

"A beetle type and a bee type? Tell me more."

Dino was pressured by the tremendous spirit. And, unintentionally, he disclosed as much information as he knew, though not much.

"O-oh? Well um, I heard that they protected Rimuru before he became a demon lord---"

Zelanus was silent as he listened.

Dino's story was over, and an awkward silence was hanging in the air.

*Give me some kind of a response!*

Dino thought that Zelanus was intimidating. Since he didn't want to talk to Zelanus, he decided to change the subject and cover up the situation.

"*Anyway,* that's it. In Ramiris's labyrinth, the defenders have a complete advantage. There are many strong players like Zegion in there, so you should consider that it will be very difficult to defeat them!"

With that, Dino ended the conversation.


![soft scene break]


As silence reigned once again, those gathered were caught up in their own thoughts.

![break]

Kagali had a lot of things to think about.

Dino's remarks were important, but for now, the first priority was to learn about her own changes.

As Kagali was searching for information and checking her on her changes, she felt a tremendous surge of power.

The seraphim are the highest-ranking angels, said to be comparable to the awakened demon lords. Kagali, who had taken in the power of the seraphim and become a "yoten," had become so strong that her demon-lord-self seemed ridiculous.

Moreover, apart from her Unique Skill 'Schemer,' she discovered that there was a new skill embedded in her soul.

Ultimate Enchantment 'Domination King Melchizedek,' given the separation of Michael's 'control' ability, boasted a terrifying performance that could instantly analyze any ability and place it under control.

However, because Kagali herself was also under the control of the power, it became impossible for her to betray Michael.

*It's terrifying. A battle between people with such power is a world I can't even imagine...*

Those were her true feelings, but when the time came to fight, Kagali's body would slaughter the enemy on its own, without her even thinking about it. Kagali instinctively understood this and felt afraid of her own change.

However---and that's why she can't stop thinking about it.

She wanted to test the immense power she had acquired.

She knew she shouldn't think about it that way, but for some reason she still wanted to.

And---

She knows the opportunity to test it would come soon enough.

Her thirst for revenge was supposed to be gone.

And yet she felt anger towards Leon for killing her, and towards Rimuru for killing Clayman.

And she wonders if she can beat them now...She knows it's pointless, but still can't stop the desire that wells up.

Was she really weaker than Dino now?

No. She never thought so.

In fact, the current Kagali, who had become a "Youten," was on the same level as Dino.

*Huh, that's pathetic, Dino. He's been like that since he was a demon lord, but I never saw Dino fight himself. That's why he's weak.*

Kagali had a hard time suppressing the feeling of amusement that welled up inside of her.

She would never be able to let her guard down.

But still---

Even though Dino was at the mercy of her opponent, she still felt like she could win.

After all, Kagali's power surpassed even that of an awakened demon lord.

Even the older demon lords, Luminas and Dino, would not be defeated by the current Kagali.

If so, then even Demon Lord Leon should be no match for her.

*Just wait, Leon. It's your turn to cry! You're next!*

Kagali continued to think, suppressing a faint feeling of pleasure. This was the kind of radicalized thinking that came from being ruled by a skill, but Kagali herself didn't notice...

![break]

Vega doesn't think about anything.

He only waits for orders.

He has gained power.

Having experienced death so many times, he has looked into the further depths of this world.

He ate Gladium and took in the blue dragon spear---a mythical grade and his weapon of choice. He even devoured the seraphim and made its power his own.

In that moment, he felt the fragments of the skills he had acquired fuse together and strengthen.

His countless defeats had given him strength.

An incarnation of explosive power.

That is who Vega is.

Recreated by Yuuki's hands, Vega had become the ultimate combat creature as a result of incorporating, fusing, and complementing various Skills.

And finally, the Unique Skill 'Evil Eater' had evolved into the Ultimate Skill 'Evil Dragon King (Azi Dahaka),'

It had a destructive power that could overwhelm existing Skills.

It was a disaster for the world that this Skill had gone to Vega, who had no clue about controlling power.

No, it's the opposite.

Perhaps it is because he tried to master his power without thinking that he was able to acquire such a skill.

Be that as it may...

Vega waits.

He waits for orders to come to him.

He can only annihilate and devour those who stand before him.

![break]

Dino looks down and thinks about the current situation.

How did this happen?

No matter how many times he asks himself, he is unable to find the answer.

A long time ago, he was given a role by Veldanava and came down to earth.

He didn't think he had much of an ego at the time, but at some point he was able to think for himself.

He asked his colleagues, Pico and Gracia, about it, and they seemed to have developed their own egos at almost the same time.

Various things happened, and Dino and his friends became fallen.

He became a demon lord to obey the orders of his vanished Lord, which was his only purpose in life.

Dino continued to watch.

He planned to watch the outcome of Guy and Rudra's game without intervening.

His loyalty to Veldanava was absolute.

Someday---Dino believed that one day, at the end of time, he would definitely come back.

And then they met.

That mysterious slime.

The brilliance of a soul that could be understood at a glance.

It was different from Veldanava, but it felt familiar.

And then the good days began.

He hated working, but was happy to be used by humans. Dino almost couldn't believe it, but for some reason, he felt satisfied.

Because it was there that he found friends to work together with.

*Oh, but even so, I betrayed Ramiris...*

What Dino regrets is the attack on Ramiris five months ago.

On Feldway's orders, he betrayed Rimuru and the others, and invited the enemy into the labyrinth. He then moved to capture Ramiris, the most important target.

The order was to dispose of her if she could not be captured, but Dino did not intend to do so. He really had not intended to kill her, but rather to seal her with 'Deep Hypno' and cover it up.

Fortunately or unfortunately, the attempt ended in failure.

And now, he was wondering why he had done such a thing.

*No, no. Then that's proof that he was telling the truth, I suppose.*

That's what Dino thinks.

He didn't want to make excuses for betraying Ramiris, but he was pretty sure he was under Michael's control.

*In other words, as long as I have 'Heavenly King Astarte', I can't go against Michael or Feldway. Seriously, you've got to be kidding me...*

Although he had grasped the situation accurately, he couldn't come up with a clever idea to overcome this situation.

The saving grace was that Rimuru believed in Dino.

*He's a shrewd guy, but he's also a softie. Even if he's easily fooled, one can't be too careful with him.*

Dino suddenly sees a blue butterfly mark on his right arm.

He thought that Zegion had overlooked it, but it seems that the birthmark had become a corridor connecting his mind and heart. Thus, Rimuru was able to contact him through that mark.

*He's seriously so shrewd, that guy.*

He had spoken directly to his heart, and yet was able to steal all of his information.

Moreover, he was forcing him to spy with impunity.

But rather than feeling abhorrent or something like that, Dino felt strangely refreshed.

Surprisingly, he was happy that Rimuru believed him.

'See you later,' huh?

Dino realized that for the first time in a long time, he felt truly happy.

And then, he thought to himself, 'what a troublesome situation.'

Dino had no intention of betraying his creator, Veldanava.

If Michael and Feldway's goal was to revive Veldanava, then Dino thinks that he should cooperate with them.

However...

'This has really become troublesome'---Those were Dino's honest feelings at the moment.

*Well, whatever. I'm not of much use to them anyway. I mean, the more I work, the weaker I become, so there's nothing I can do about it. Besides, it's better for both sides if I don't work hard, so it's a wish come true!*

The good thing about Dino is that he doesn't immediately worry about things.

The always positive Dino, who was unrivaled when it came to slacking off, came to his conclusion with an easy-going mind.

This positivity was what made Dino such a frightening man.

Dino, feeling refreshed, waited for Feldway and the others with a cheerful face.

![break]

Arios thinks.

His superiors, Kagali and the others, were talking, but he had no idea what they were talking about.

He wanted to complain, but his instincts told him that it would not be a good idea.

And rightly so.

Arios was under Kagali's control. The spell was still in effect, even now when he had become a 'Yōten' (Heavenly Spirit) through the undead elf.

If he had awakened on his own, it would have been a different story, but since his evolution was a set-up, it was inevitable that the dominion would be strengthened.

Arios, who did not have the time to feel annoyed, was aware of his current situation.

Filled with incredible power, he was elated with a sense of omnipotence.

The most significant change was that his Unique Skill 'Murderer' had evolved into the Ultimate Enchantment 'Conviction King Sandalphon.'

Of course, it had not been acquired by himself.

The 'Conviction King Sandalphon' that Michael recovered from Kondou had been given to Arios. 'Murderer' was consumed for this purpose, but Arios could not resist it at will.

However, Arios himself was not dissatisfied.

He was simply happy to have the power, and continued to wait for his turn.

![break]

Orca-Aria was confused.

She couldn't afford to listen to the conversations around her, and was talking to her inner voice.

*Who am I? Am I Aria? Or Orca?*

*I don't know. I'm Aria, but I'm also Orca.*

Confused as they were, they also felt their consciousnesses becoming unified.

It was not unpleasant, but rather pleasant.

*I am "Orlia".*

This was the moment that the answer came to her.

Although Orlia was a newborn, she was still able to use the skills of a first-rate warrior and wizard.

Moreover, the Ultimate Enchantment 'Alternative' that was given to her was optimized in Orlia and transformed into the Ultimate Enchantment 'Multiple Weapons.'

This allowed Orlia to use the experience she has accumulated in her body to create a variety of weapons. Although there was a limit to the number of weapons that could be used simultaneously, the grade was equivalent to mythical-grade.

Fully armed with multiple weapons, Orlia was not afraid to fight her enemies.

![break]

Mai Furuki was in despair.

She thought she was dead, but she had come back to life.

That's good.

The problem was that Mai, even now, could not fulfill her hope of returning to Japan even though she had more power.

*I'm not giving up. My Unique Skill 'Traveler' couldn't do it, but Yuuki-kun said there was a possibility. If a Skill is born from desire, then there must be a power that can make my wish come true.*

At that moment when she thought as such with an empty heart---

The Ultimate Enchantment 'Alternative' given by Michael was consumed at the same time as the seraphim was inhabited, and Mai's 'Traveler' evolved.

It became the Ultimate Enchantment 'World Map.'

Not only could she picture any place in the world, but she could also understand what was happening in that location, which was an extraordinary power. What was even more amazing is that it was now possible to use 'Instantaneous Movement' to go to any place she desired without any time difference.

For a person with spatial abilities, this was an unbelievable power.

And yet, Mai's wish was not fulfilled.

The coordinates on this 'World Map' were only for this world.

In other words, it was impossible to cross the dimensional barrier.

Mai understood this without even trying.

It was a great despair, but either way, Mai was no longer free.

Everything was at Michael's disposal.

Until the day she could finally be free to travel to her beloved younger brother, Mai would keep her heart closed and continue to follow orders.


![soft scene break]


It is not only those who have been reborn as 'Yōten' who are trying to figure out what is going on.

Zalario and Obera were also considering their own situations.

First of all, Zalario was grateful for the physical body he had gained. Even though he had great power, he was only able to wield it in the Otherworld. In the Cardinal World, the more power he exerted, the more energy he lost.

In order to prevent this, a body was needed, but it was difficult to prepare a vessel that could withstand the power of someone as powerful as Zalario.

Now that that problem had been solved, he would be able to show his true strength on the surface, but there was still a big problem that arose here.

*Oh dear. Because of my increased power, I seem to have acquired the angelic system skill 'Judgement King Israfil'...*

Yes, that was the problem.

Zalario had acquired the Ultimate Skill 'Judgement King Israfil' upon his incarnation.

*I can't defy Michael with this. But if I threw it away, I would be suspected of treason.*

From Zalario's point of view, Feldway is a colleague, and although he recognizes him as his superior, he does not hold absolute obedience to him.

Besides, he was skeptical about Michael.

Feldway trusts Michael, but Zalario does not. Zalario was not so easily convinced by a will arising from a skill.

For now, he was convinced of their purpose and agreed with it, but it was unknown if that would last forever. There was no doubt that he had wanted to avoid possessing an angelic Skill, in case their paths ever diverged.

Nevertheless, the 'Judgement King Israfil' had been obtained.

As long as it was not the Ultimate Enchantment, Michael's will would not intervene. There is no doubt that this was a natural skill that he acquired, and for that reason, it seemed inadvisable to throw it away.

*Now, I wonder how much Michael knows about it.*

There was no doubt that he could rule over the angelic Skills, given his ability to control Velgrynd and Velzard. However, he should change his actions depending on how far he could grasp the owner of the system.

*My will is my own, and I will not allow it to be rewritten without my knowledge.*

Zalario was a rational thinker.

Therefore, he did not interfere in the control of the True Dragon sisters out of respect for the high success rate of the operation, even if he really disliked the operation.

And now, he was in the same position.

*Really, what a mess...*

Since he didn't oppose it in the first place, his current situation was his own fault. Even so, he pondered on how to deal with Michael.

![break]

Obera was the same.

Like Zalario, Obera had acquired the Ultimate Skill of the Angelic System. And like Zalario, it was not something she wanted.

What Obera obtained was the Ultimate Skill 'Salvation King Azrael.'

It was an incredibly powerful skill, but it was useless to her.

The reason is that those who were born as primordial beings already had administrative authority without having to rely on a Skill.

They could activate all kinds of magic instantly, and if they made full use of it, they wouldn't need to rely on Skills. It was more flexible and could be used to achieve anything.

For Obera and the others, whose very existence was at the ultimate level, it made no difference whether they had Ultimate Skill or not.

That's why she got it at this moment, even though she didn't wish for it. Moreover, she was pretty sure that it was an angelic system skill...

*This is not good. If I don't do something, they might find out that I'm disloyal.*

*...*

Obera, who had planned to turn completely, was now in a more serious situation than Zalario.

What should she do now? Obera thought.

She wouldn't worry about having her mind read.

It was not a problem for her to erase the surface thoughts of her mind.

However, this would not be the case if she were to be manipulated without knowing it, so she needed to think of a countermeasure.

*Let's make a self-imposed suggestion.*

Obera decided.

If a contradiction arose within herself, she would not hesitate to destroy the 'Salvation King Azrael.'

Because she was an ultimate spiritual life form, she was capable of such unconventional actions.

However, if that happened, it would mean a complete break away from Feldway.

Depending on the situation, even Obera would not be safe.

But even so, for the sake of Milim, the orphaned daughter of Veldanava, Obera believed that there was no need to worry.

*It would be nothing but disrespectful for us to discern the thoughts of the Creator. Feldway is too selfish, even though he may not resurrect of his own volition.*

That was the truth.

And Obera believed that Milim was the rightful successor.


![soft scene break]


A beautiful bell rang.

Solemn, clear, and tickling at the heartstrings.

Then the door opened, and out walked Michael, Feldway, and Velzard.

With just those three people, they radiated an air of supremacy that could blow away any divine spirit that had filled the hall.

Waiting for Michael to be seated, Feldway and Velzard also took their seats.

"Well then, let's begin."

And so, the strategy meeting began.

![break]

On command, Mai stood up and projected a three-dimensional image of the entire Cardinal World at the center of the round table.

It was a miniature figure of the earth.

From a god's perspective, the stronghold of the demon lords was shown.

"These are the strongholds of the Octagram who are opposing us, and their key points. There are six of them."

The north pole of Guy, the western edge of Dagruel, the central west of Luminas, the forest of Rimuru, the southeast of Milim, and the continent of Leon.

In response to Michael's comment, Mai lit up six points of light on the ground.

"I would like to hear your opinions on how we should attack."

'Everyone,' he had called out, but only a few people were actually within Feldway's line of sight.

They were Zalario and Obera, and Yuuki and Kagali.

Dino and his group were not good at planning operations, and Vega was not an option from the start. As for the others, he didn't give them the right to speak because he considered them to be beneath them.

Zalario and Obera were silent, as if watching the situation. Kagali, sensing the atmosphere, opened her mouth.

"In this case, the aggressor has the advantage. I think we should concentrate our forces and target a single spot."

"I agree. However, it is difficult to know where to aim."

The defenders would have to spread out their forces. Kagali and Yuuki agreed that there was no need for the defender to match their opponents.

Surprisingly, it was Dino who spoke up after hearing this.

"Just so you know, you shouldn't go to Ramiris' labyrinth. Following that, the capital of the Monster Federation, "Rimuru," will be isolated in the labyrinth during the war. It won't be easy to get rid of, so I recommend you target it last."

Since this information was shared, no one objected. They realized that if they took too long in the labyrinth, they might be surrounded and annihilated by reinforcements from other countries.

"Let's do that last. By attacking elsewhere, we might be able to lure those who are holed up inside."

Ramiris would become a huge nuisance if they were forced to play defense. With that in mind, they needed to plan his attack.

"There's no one left at the Frost Palace. There is no sign of them."

It was Velzard who suddenly spoke up.

Her gaze was sharp and fixed on Leon's continent.

"Hmm, so the enemy has thought of a countermeasure. By consolidating the demon lords, they avoided dispersing their own forces."

"Indeed. It seems that there are five places on the ground where huge power is concentrated."

Mai removed Guy's north pole point and strengthened the remaining five points of light.

There was only one less option, but the difficulty seemed to have increased greatly. However, the advantage of the attacker still remained.

So, where should they aim?

This is where Zalario came in.

"Feldway-sama, I have a question."

"What is it?"

"Michael-sama has absolute control over the angelic systems, but are we able to get a hint as to where the owners are?"

He had asked an important question here, one that would affect him as well.

Obera was also in on it.

"That is a concern. If we can find out who they are, we should probably get them on our side first."

'Hmm,' Michael nodded.

"I couldn't sense them before, but now I know. I know now that others possess the 'Judgement King Israfil' and the 'Salvation King Azrael,' and I know that Dino and the others have the 'Heavenly King Astarte,' 'Glory King Haniel,' and 'Rigor King Jibril.' The remaining 'Domination King Melchizedek' is owned by Kagali, and Arios is the owner of the 'Punishment King Sandalphon.' And then there are the higher angelic systems that are the 'same rank' as me---"

At those words, Michael frowned.

"Not enough."

And with that, everyone became tense.

"What does that mean?" Feldway asked.

Michael responded with a brief explanation.

"First, Velgrynd's 'Charity King Raguel' was recovered and given to the right person."

No one responded to this.

There was an eerie silence, but unconcerned, Michael continued.

"Then there was the 'Patience King' (Gabriel),' which was never recovered and remains in Velzard's possession."

The icy beauty remained motionless, her face expressionless. This was a natural step to maintain the rule of the 'Ultimate Dominion.'

"So far, the owners of these Skills are known, but three of the four remaining Skills are problematic."

With that said, Michael's explanation continued.

Michael had taken Velgrynd's power for himself and had also taken in Velzard's dragon factor. This greatly increased his power, allowing him to search for signs of the owners of the other angelic systems under his control.

However, he was only able to find the 'Purity King Metatron,'

"What? If it was the Ultimate Skill 'Hope King Sariel,' wouldn't it have belonged to the Chosen Hero Chronoa?"

"There was no response. I don't know if it's because my surveillance was unable to reach Ramiris' labyrinth, or if there were other reasons."

"Hmm, Ramiris is not to be underestimated. It's no wonder you can't see into the labyrinth. If that's the case, should we assume that the 'Covenant King Uriel' and the 'Knowledge King Raphael' also have owners in the same place?"

"I'm not sure, but I think it's reasonable to assume so. After all, there is no other place I cannot explore with my skill."

There were no other skills created by Veldanava, and the only other possibility was Ramiris' Intrinsic Skill, 'Labyrinth Creation.'

So Michael's conclusion was that the remaining three existed in the same place.

He was correct.

But now they were already gone, and even their essence had been changed...

Unaware of this, Michael decided that the problem had been resolved.

And so did Feldway and the others.

"Hmm. Well then, no problem. Either way, Veldora is in the labyrinth, and we're going to attack him anyway. We can find him and then add him to our ranks."

"Is it safe to assume that the enemy has someone on the inside?"

"Exactly. We can find them at a glance, so we'll worry about that later. What we need to think about now is where to make our first target, but---"

"I think we already have an answer. There's only one known owner, so why don't we add that one to the group first?"

That's what Yuuki had decided.

His free will had been taken away, but his ability to plan ahead^[The word used was "深謀遠慮" which is a Chinese idiom meaning "deep plans and distant thoughts." Or, 'to plan far ahead.'] still remained intact.

"Hmm. The one who possesses the 'Purity King Metatron' is here---"

All eyes focused on his fingertips.

Michael pointed to El Dorado, the capital of Leon's territory.

"That's the Demon Lord Leon who killed me." Kagali muttered to herself.

This was the moment when she realized that the flash of light that had burned her to the ground had been caused by the 'Purity King Metatron.'

"Then I guess it's decided. So, who's going to attack?" Yuuki asked with a smile.

"I'm going. I don't know or care if it's Demon Lord Leon or whatever, but you don't mind if I eat him, do you?"

"Did you not hear what was said? Leon could become one of us."

"Che, damn. In that case, I'll just have to put up with the rest of them."

Yuuki and Vega were talking to each other, as if they had already decided where to attack.

There was no one to stop them, and the decision was made.


![soft scene break]


There was no need to declare war, since the goal of this war was to revive Veldanava.

Michael and Feldway decided as such.

Inevitably, the war would start with a surprise attack.

There was no need to spare any forces, but Feldway had his own ideas about that.

"The goal is to obtain the owner of the 'Purity King Metatron.' It would be nice if we could get rid of some of the people who interfere with that, but it would be no fun to cause damage here. Therefore, let's leave the fools behind."

He declared that he would attack only with the strongest.

Michael's 'Ultimate Dominion' was versatile but it was not unconditionally activated. It was an absolute dominion over the angelic system, but it required him to cross his line of sight with the target.

Incidentally, the 'Regalia Dominion' had even more complicated conditions.

The Dominion Bullet, which had been loaned to Lieutenant Kondou, could only be used on a single target, and the success rate was low unless the target was caught off guard. The 'Regalia Dominion,' on the other hand, changed the number of people it controlled depending on the presence of the target. And most importantly was that the success rate was lower when the opponent was of the same rank as the user, meaning that they had to inflict a considerable blow or else it would fail.

At the very least, the opponent had to have a weaker presence than the user to succeed, so it was a difficult skill to use.

The current value of Michael's existence was about 90 million. However, Yuuki's existence value (about 2 million) was subtracted from it, so an attack on Veldora, whose existence value was over 88 million, would not succeed.

Michael had no way of knowing that, but nevertheless, he believed that controlling Veldora would be a difficult task. That is why he needed to gather his forces before attacking Ramiris' labyrinth.

That was also why they were trying to add the targeted person to their ranks without diminishing the strength of their own camp.

And so, the members of the sortie were decided.

"I'm staying behind." Declared Dino, who was staying behind.

"What about me and my army?"

"I want you all to be ready to move your troops. We're planning to launch a full-scale invasion following this operation."

"Understood."

The insectars led by Zelanus began to prepare for war, as did the phantom army.

Zalario's army was being coordinated by Dhalis and Nice.

Since Obera's army was still deployed in the otherworldly stronghold, Obera was to return and hand over the control to Oma.

Then, all the remaining officers went out to battle.

![break]

If it was just the officers, Mai's 'Instantaneous Movement' would take them to their destination in an instant. With Obera, there would be no problem to identify the coordinates using 'Presence Detection,' and they could easily meet up with each other immediately using 'Spatial Transportation.'

Based on this judgment, the surprise operation was launched.
