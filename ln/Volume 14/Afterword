# Afterword

Long time no see, Fuse here.

I got the flu at the end of last year and my body was going through a lot. The deadline was originally set at the end of last year, but it was missed by quite a few days. I can only express my gratitude to I-san (Editor) for extending the deadline. I will try to be a little more careful in the future so that I can have more time.

I can almost hear I-san's voice saying, "Only a little more careful?" The development of this volume was a little different from that of the web novel. You can see for yourself how things have changed, but the full story of the Eastern Empire has finally been revealed. Who is the beautiful woman on the cover?

...Well, most of you have probably guessed that. She is beautiful, isn't she, Dora's sister? I asked Mitz Vah-sensei to give her a charming and sexy look. In the words of the main character of a certain cartoon, 'breasts, buttocks and thighs', these are the three elements of a man's eternal dream. It is nice to show only a glimpse of them without showing too much. This is called shady aestheticism---but I digress. It's difficult to calm my heightened emotions after a deadline, so please forgive me if I digress.

And so, thank you Mitz Vah, for all of your wonderful illustrations! And to all the fans who support us. I've received your fan letters, and they have been a great encouragement to me. I would love to respond to them, but I don't think I'll have the time due to my lazy nature. I have read through all of them and will keep them in a safe place. And thanks to all the people who have been involved in this work!

As a result of your support, we have decided to produce a second season of the anime. As the author of this work, I deeply feel the anticipation for 'That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime'. In response to your gratitude, I will continue to do my best to make this work even better!

See you next time!
