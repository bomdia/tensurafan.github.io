# Chapter 2: Future Plans

Before I forgot, I decided to thank Veldora and Ramiris. The reward for Veldora was clothes. I thought it might be a little problematic since he was always wearing a cloak and no clothes on his upper body, but he didn't seem to mind. Perhaps he liked this kind of clothing so I took the opportunity to give him some clothes as a gift.

"Oh, Rimuru! My friend and ally! At last, you have noticed my feelings. I have always wanted to wear something nice."

"No, no, no, you could have asked Shuna to get it for you right away, couldn't you? I mean, there were clothes that you could adjust the size by magic in the clothing store."

"You fool. The only thing that will fit me is a one-of-a-kind, custom-made piece. And if it is made by you, my trusted friend, that means it's the best, right?"

Uh, actually, I don't have any sense of style...

I think Veldora overestimates me. Even my own clothes are just what people tell me to wear. Come to think of it, the same was true even in my previous life. I had the worst taste in everyday clothes. That's why I always wore suits. The rest of what I wore consisted of jerseys. Those were really nice. I didn't have to worry about getting them dirty, and they were the most relaxing thing in the world. I was surprised that Veldora was more pleased than I had expected. Veldora quickly and happily began to put on his clothes.

![full page image](image5)

"W-Well, I'm glad you're happy. I look forward to your help again in the future!"

"Mm. Leave it to me. Kuahahaha!"

Considering the profit margin, it turned out to be a ridiculously cheap reward. Well, some of the clothes were custom-made with luxurious materials, but still, what can I say...

Well, next time I have free time, I'll think of something else to thank him with. Regarding Veldora, I would just leave it for the future. Next up was Ramiris.

"Ramiris, you also helped me this time. Thank you."

"What, you're being so cynical! I'm indebted to you too! This is what we call mutual help!"

Ramiris answered a little sheepishly. I was a bit embarrassed too, but it was important to express my gratitude.

"That's why, I wanted to give you a gift of gratitude."

"What's going on? Did you make clothes for me like you did for Master?"

"You'll have to talk to Shuna about that. As for me..."

Clothes for girls were out of my league. I'd rely on Shuna for that, so I proposed 'Naming'.

"Does that mean you can name my cute little dragon lords?"

"Something like that."

"And I'll be the parent?"

"That's right."

"That's awesome!"

Well, yeah. Although I was surprised too, it didn't matter because it actually succeeded.

"At yesterday's celebration, my colleague Adalmann's pet, Wenti, was 'Named'. Then it evolved and became able to change into a humanoid form and also to speak fluently. So, I was wondering if your dragon lords would be interested in this too."

It was a surprise that Wenti turned into a human, but come to think of it, a dragon turning into a human seems pretty standard in stories. It was not completely unexpected. Therefore, there is a possibility that the four dragon lords under Ramiris would be able to turn into human forms, like Wenti. If so, that would increase her manpower, which would make Beretta's hardships less heavy.

"If that's the case, I'm counting on you!" Ramiris nodded happily. After obtaining her consent, I began the session.

"Do you have any good names in mind?"

"Hmmm, I'll just leave it all to you."

Ramiris was not good at coming up with names. If I left it to her, the dragons would end up like some fantasy game bosses...no wait, wouldn't that be okay?

Come to think of it, I was the boss, so I didn't need to worry about that. I asked Ramiris to gather the dragon lords in the King's Chamber of the Labyrinth. I looked at the dragon lords lined up in front of me and thought to myself that they too had suffered many defeats. However, they did their best, so I wanted to think of good names for them. A dragon lord possessed more magicules than an archdemon. However, since it hadn't been very long since Milim picked them up, the dragon lords here were not as strong in certain respects.

If they could evolve by naming, their intelligence would increase all at once. If so, they would become smarter and stronger than they are now. I should look at each one of them and think of a suitable name. Intuition was the key for this kind of thing.

The Fire Dragon Lord was Euros, the 'Draconic Flamelord'.

The Ice Dragon Lord was Zephyrus, the 'Draconic Frostlord'.

The Wind Dragon Lord was Notos, the 'Draconic Skylord'.

The Earth Dragon Lord was Boreas, the 'Draconic Terralord'.

I borrowed these names from Greek mythology. The names of the dragon lords were originally from the Greek gods who controlled the winds of the east, west, north, and south, but I thought it was suitable for these dragon lords. Naming the dragon lords was my own idea, but the soul connection would be formed with Ramiris. I was relieved to see that this was also a success. Thus, a soul connection was formed between Ramiris and the dragon lords. I hoped that they would continue to do their best as Ramiris' official subordinates. So how was their evolution?

As expected, the dragon lords really could change into human-like forms. They were not completely humanoid, and they still had the characteristics of dragons remaining.

'Draconic Flamelord' Euros was a beautiful woman with red hair. Her auburn skin was covered with a garb of dragon scales, and her tail appeared to be a whip of flame.

'Draconic Frostlord' Zephyrus was a slender, handsome man. His graceful and gentle appearance combined with his long green hair might almost make one mistake him for a beautiful woman.

'Draconic Skylord' Notos was a petite little girl. She looked pretty from a distance, but closer inspection revealed jagged teeth and fangs. She was a powerful creature whose strength was not commensurate with her mass.

'Draconic Terralord' Boreas was a large, muscular man. He was covered with dragon scales and had spines all over his body.

All four of them looked like the leaders of a secret society of evil, and their 'deformed beauty' was a fusion of horror and beauty. Such a form was only a type of state change. They did not become dragonoids like Milim, but remained as dragon lords like before. In the end, a dragonoid is a spiritual being with a physical body, like an irregular form of a 'True Dragon'. Even if a dragon lord possesses strong power, as long as it is trapped in their own body, their power would be far from that of a 'True Dragon', which was a perfect spiritual life form. Although there was no change in the race, evolution had succeeded without any problem. Moreover, they seemed to have succeeded in acquiring a more powerful mana than expected.

Their total magicule counts were several times larger than before the evolution, and they appeared to have reached the level of an awakened Clayman. While not as good as a 'True Demon Lord', they were a wonderful evolution. I shuddered to think what would have happened if I had consumed my own magicules, when 'Naming' alone showed such an increased rate. If I had not done what I did, I might have suffered irreparable damage. 'Naming' was a terrible system, after all. I had used more than 5,000 souls, and I was reminded once again that monsters were not logical beings. But, well, it's only a loss if you care about it. Thus, the evolution of the dragon lords, which also served as a thank-you to Ramiris, was successfully completed.

![break]

By the way, 'Dungeon's Elite Ten' were almost equal in terms of the amount of magicules. However, in terms of the unquantifiable fighting power, there appeared to be a big gap between them. Zegion was the leader, that went without saying. Compared to the other 'Elite Ten', the evolved dragon lords were still weaker. They had strong physical strength as monsters, along with the means to attack. They also possessed various kinds of magic. All of these alone were undoubtedly a mighty and powerful force. However, that could not be used against those who were skilled in battle of the same rank. It is because of their lack of combat experience that they were fundamentally low in skill-level.

The dragon lords must have been defeated many times in this defensive battle, and must have felt very frustrated. As soon as they evolved and became able to speak human language fluently, they asked for more training. By transforming into humanoid form, the dragon lords were able to learn the skills of human combat. Then they realized that a refined art was stronger than the conventional fighting style of monsters. Instead of relying on physical attacks with their breath, claws, and fangs, they used magic and incorporated it into their fighting. Then, they learned how to fight as a human being and tried to incorporate it into actual combat. It was a remarkable development for them to come to this conclusion by their own thinking. The training offer was accepted.

"Kuahahaha! Leave it to me!"

Veldora, who was in a good mood after raising Zegion, agreed to train the dragon lords. Thus began the dragon lord cultivation training.

![break]

---Later, some of the dragon lords appeared to be stronger in human form than in their original dragon form. That might seem to be a bit of a reversal, but since they had mastered the art of transforming their own claws and scales into weapons and armor, the result was probably justified.

I did not learn about this until much later, but I had the feeling that it was only natural.

![hard scene break]

Three days had passed since their resurrection, and Calgurio and his team had regained their composure. They were shocked to know that they had been brought back to life by the demon lord. It was indescribable, but they somehow succeeded in accepting it. The question was, what position should they take from now on? They were still living in tents. Food had been arranged and was brought to them by monsters on a regular basis. No one complained, even if they were skeletons. The tents were lined up on a hillside where the grass and trees had withered away. Although the scenery was poor, it was neither hot nor cold, and the space was surprisingly comfortable. The ruins of the battlefield combined with the air of death and the rows of graves of the dead were nothing to be concerned about once one got used to them. That was because it would be strange to be afraid of the graves whose contents were always out and about.

In short, it was an environment where they did not feel much dissatisfaction in their daily lives. According to the explanation, this place was located on the 70th floor in the labyrinth. The person who gave the explanation was a 'wight king' named Adalmann, who was in charge of guarding the labyrinth. Since some of them had actually fought in the labyrinth, there was no one who doubted him. Adalmann was a good man and treated Calgurio and the others as proper prisoners of war.

"Since my god Rimuru-sama has brought you back to life, I must do as he wills. He is not the kind of person who would take away your life once he has given it, so you may take your time to think about what you should do in the future."

Adalmann said as such, setting Calgurio and the others free. No one had ever suggested that they flee this hierarchy. They were already in god's hands. They realized this and decided to believe in Demon Lord Rimuru. Calgurio agreed with this decision, and he was also convinced that they would fail if they tried to escape. That is why he took Adalmann's words to heart and decided to call the upper management together for a meeting.

![break]

Nearly one hundred officers gathered in the large tent used for military discussions. They were senior officers and some of the Empire's leading champions. Of course, they were now people without power...

"Now, gentlemen. Let me first apologize to you. It is my incompetence that has brought this upon you. I am deeply sorry."

Calgurio looked around at those gathered and bowed his head. The response was a unanimous denial.

"What are you saying? We are just as guilty for not stopping you, sir."

When the deputy said as such, the chiefs of staff nodded in agreement. The senior officers also said that Calgurio was not solely responsible. Krishna was the most evident.

"I agree with everyone. We have incurred the wrath of god because of our stupidity. And by god's mercy, we have been given the opportunity to atone for our sins."

He regarded the imperial invasion itself as a sin. Calgurio agreed with him. They had been so overconfident with their own military power that they did not understand anything about their enemies. Looking back, Calgurio thought to himself of what a fool he had been. He also thought that his companions must feel the same way, and gave a smile as if in relief.

"Thank you. I feel a little calmer now that you have said that. I promise to god that I will remember this feeling for the rest of my life."

At the mention of the word 'god', Calgurio's mind was filled with the image of the Demon Lord Rimuru.

*Yes, for me, the god of the moment is now His Majesty Rimuru.*

Back in the Empire, there was no place for Calgurio. He would be blamed for the defeat and be executed before even waiting for a court-martial. He had no intention of evading the responsibility, but Calgurio did not think that he should throw away the life given to him by Rimuru for nothing.

*Well, I can take time to think about it slowly.*

He could take care of himself later, Calgurio thought as a matter of course. His face was no longer the same self-preserving and desire-driven expression it once was.

"Let's get down to business. The reason I have gathered you all here today is to get a consensus on how we should move forward. Adalmann-dono has generously given me the freedom to discuss this with you. Let us not waste his kindness and have a meaningful time!"

Calgurio started the discussion, and those present looked at each other and began to discuss. This was an unthinkable situation in a military meeting, but for Calgurio, who wanted everyone's honest opinions, it was a welcome thing.

The chatting continued for a while. The discussion was narrowed down to roughly two main opinions. Those who insisted that they should remain subservient. And those who insisted that they should return to the Empire once and for all. The two sides were in direct conflict with each other. Both sides had understandable arguments, and it was natural that those who had families would insist on returning to the Empire. However, whether or not they could return to their homeland depended on the intentions of Demon Lord Rimuru. There was a possibility that they would be allowed to do so after further negotiations, but if they made too much noise, they might cause the demon lord's displeasure.

"As Adalmann-dono said, I trust that there is no intention to execute us for nothing. But we must keep in mind that this does not mean that we are pardoned."

As long as they had been saved, their fate was in the hands of the demon lord. Even though they were allowed a certain degree of freedom, it was unknown as to what extent their selfishness would be accepted.

"...In any case, we will be executed even if we do go back. But still, I would like to let the generals who fought for our country return home safely. I would like to appeal directly to his Majesty Rimuru and ask for his favor."

"However, we are basically hostages. Whether the home country will pay compensation or not, that is the difficult point."

At that moment, Major General Minits, who had been silently listening to everyone's opinions, opened his mouth.

"Impossible. In the first place, we did not even expect to lose. We ourselves had been so ruthless in our attitude toward our adversaries."

Everyone was silenced by his words. The Empire had never accepted anything but unconditional surrender in the first place. It was only because they had been winning that they had been allowed to be so arrogant. Now that they had fought and been utterly defeated, they would be on their own if they were not forgiven. Everyone understood this fact and realized that the future was not bright, even if they did return to the Empire. Even so, they still wanted to fulfill their responsibility to those with families.

"Major General Minits is right. I wonder what his Majesty will think about this..."

"I hate to say this, but it was an oversight of the intelligence bureau. Did they even realize how many demon lord class monsters there were out there?"

One of the officers made a statement that should not have been spoken.

"Hey, you! Be careful of what you say. I don't care what you think of the Bureau of Intelligence, but you can be sure that the people you're referring to as monsters are the top brass of this country!"

"I'm sorry, it was my mistake..."

Free speech was welcome, and no one here was a monster. Calgurio had not seen Adalmann since yesterday and thought that he must be meeting somewhere. That is why today's military meeting was held, but that was not a reason to tolerate all the comments. They must not forget that they were prisoners of war.

"His Majesty Rimuru may be a generous man, but he will not overlook outbursts against his men. Please remember that and be careful of what you say."

Calgurio concluded by saying that he agreed with the officer's opinion. At the least, one could understand just how terrifying Demon Lord Rimuru was simply by the fact that he had someone under his command who could handle an extremely powerful magic like 'Gravity Collapse'. Why didn't the intelligence bureau know about such a dangerous opponent?

*I very much understand your desire to scold them for being negligent though. I honestly wanted to say that lie myself...*

Calgurio thought so inwardly. However, someone then made a comment that felt as if ice cold water was poured on Calgurio and the other officers.

"Are you idiots? Listen up, the intelligence bureau already had a certain amount of information at that time."

Bernie, who had been listening to the conversation in silence all this time, suddenly burst out laughing and said so.

"Nonsense! Then why did they withhold the correct information from His Majesty?"

"Did they betray us?"

Bernie's words had everyone in a state of fluster. Only Minits and Calgurio remained calm. Minits was the first to open his mouth.

"Bernie, you say? I believe you were on an undercover mission that we weren't even informed about?"

Next was Calgurio.

"Of course. As a Single Digit, it's no surprise that you had access to top-secret information that even we didn't know. So, what were they thinking, and what did they want us to do?"

The moment the question was posed, everyone's eyes focused on Bernie. Everyone wanted to know. The Intelligence Bureau was sworn to His Majesty the Emperor with absolute loyalty. It was hard to believe that they would betray the Emperor, which meant that Emperor Rudra was also in a position to know of this situation. Bernie snorted and looked around at Calgurio and the others with pity. Then, without hesitation, he dropped the bombshell.

"Just as you might have imagined. His Majesty the Emperor also knew everything from the start. Your defeat was already in the works."

"H-How could..."

"What do you mean? Did His Majesty send his army knowing we would lose?"

"No way! You insult His Majesty too much!"

The officers were in distress. However, some of them had already begun to understand.

"I guess that makes sense. So, in other words, we were pawns."

"That's not an accurate way of putting it, Minits. I'm afraid that the main purpose was---"

"Hmph! Shut up, Calgurio. I'll take responsibility for this leak of state secrets. You're all dead men, including me, so this isn't a betrayal of His Majesty."

This was Bernie's determination. Now that he had lost his power as a 'Single Digit' and had been deprived of the ultimate skill lent to him by the Emperor, he was now the superior figure to show the way for everyone.

"Bernie..."

"I'm sorry, Jiwu. I, for one, wasn't that loyal to His Majesty. The only reason I followed him was because I could never beat him."

That was also Bernie's true feelings.

.........

......

...

Born forty-five years ago in the United States, Bernie was an ordinary student who loved freedom. Somehow he had come to this world and was discovered by Gadra. He was taken in by Damrada and learned the art of fighting. He became confident and even became proud that he was one of the best in this world. Then Bernie's confidence was shattered by a woman who was a close associate of Emperor Rudra. No, rather, she was a monster despite her beautiful appearance. The supreme being of the world that would never be reached, no matter how the heavens and the earth were turned upside down, no matter how many times one was reincarnated. He could not believe that such a being existed, but it was indeed real.

Her name was Velgrynd. She was one of the top secrets of the Empire. One day, Bernie was escorted by Damrada to the Emperor's castle. It was a great honor, and it furthered Bernie's ambition. As a freedom-loving person, Bernie could not tolerate the Emperor's domination over others. Therefore, he had foolishly dreamed of overthrowing the Emperor if possible. The price of such foolishness was extreme fear. It was there that Bernie met Velgrynd for the first time. And after understanding true fear, he naturally gave in.

Emperor Rudra approached Bernie from behind the blind.

<You are qualified. As a vessel, I will lend you my strength, so keep up the good work.>

He thought he heard Emperor Rudra's voice, devoid of any emotion, coming from far away. The next time he regained consciousness, he found himself in a body that could not resist the Emperor.

.........

......

...

"His Majesty, you know, doesn't care if a million of his best men are wiped out. Rather, it is all part of the plan."

That was impossible to make sense of for most people just by hearing it, however, Calgurio understood.

"---So that's it. So they are willing to sacrifice a million soldiers if the result will be that some of us can be awakened like me."

Bernie was a bit surprised that he was able to guess the correct answer with such a simple explanation. However, upon hearing Calgurio say, 'one who awakened like me', it all made sense to him.

"Oh, so you've awakened as well. In that case, you understand, and you're correct. His Majesty the Emperor wanted to collect the pawns who had been awakened. For that purpose, even if it cost a million sacrifices, he believed it would be worth it."

This was a fact that even the senior officers did not know about. From the very beginning, Emperor Rudra had no expectations of the military itself. The most important thing was how to gather awakened people.

"Quality over quantity, is it? In that case, why did they fail in defeating Veldora 300 years ago?"

Minits asked Bernie this with a sharp look in his eyes. Bernie replied aloofly.

"I don't know what happened back then, but if you think about it, it makes sense, doesn't it? I could have killed you all by myself. That's how far apart in ability we are."

"I-I see... Is that the reason why our defeat was factored in? A strategy based on the assumption that there would be casualties. While I'd like to tell His Majesty that it was for a worthy cause, this time it was nothing but a total failure."

"That's how it is. His Majesty the Emperor would not have expected to be defeated after awakening."

Minits nodded in agreement. Calgurio, listening to the conversation, had a bitter look on his face.

"Alas, it is my fault that I wasn't good enough."

Bernie denied this.

"Don't worry. It's not that you weren't good enough. It's just that the opponent was too strong."

"Right. That was simply not something we could beat."

Jiwu nodded in agreement. They, too, had been defeated by Diablo, who had defeated Calgurio. It was in no way surprising that Calgurio couldn't win against a monster that they themselves could not defeat.

"Does this mean that the strength of the forces here is greater than the intelligence bureau expected?"

"It should be. The plan to use Demon Lord Rimuru as a stepping stone to increase our leverage here was foiled the moment we misjudged the strength of our opponents."

Bernie spoke as if he couldn't help but laugh. It was not a situation that could easily be laughed at, since a great deal of sacrifice had gone to waste. However, Bernie still felt in his heart that the Emperor deserved it.

"---So, Bernie-kun, now that your surprise attack while using us as a diversion seems to have failed, what are you planning to do after this?"

"Huh? I told you. I'll take responsibility."

"What do you mean by that?" Minits asked calmly. In the silent tent, everyone waited for Bernie's answer.

"Let's get one thing straight. As I said before, you guys are already dead. I don't mean that in a metaphorical sense, but in His Majesty's sense."

"Hmm. Are you suggesting that his Majesty doesn't want us to be alive?"

"That's a bit of a misnomer. It means that he has no need for soldiers whose power has been taken from them and whose chances of awakening have been reduced to zero. If you're of no value to him, then it means he has no further reason to protect you."

"Well, I suppose that's true."

"On that basis, it is very likely that they will not accept the return of prisoners of war. No, not only that. If the surviving soldiers return home, the anti-war sentiment will spread. Do you think that would be in accordance with His Majesty's will?"

"I don't think so."

Minits let out a sigh. He understood what Bernie was trying to say.

"In other words, we are nothing more than a distraction to the intelligence bureau now that we are no longer important to His Majesty, correct?"

"Right."

"Will he move to deal with those who are trying to return home?"

"Definitely."

And then they would put the blame on Tempest, inciting anger and vengeance among their subjects. Bernie explained with certainty that the intelligence bureau would work in that way.

"700,000? That's impossible."

"Those who have undergone the transformative operation have not lost that much power. If we fought back, we would be fighting amongst ourselves!"

Minits silenced the officers, who began to make a fuss by restraining them with his hand.

"Do you have any idea who could do that?"

Minits remained calm amidst the many who wanted to say that this was absurd. And Calgurio, remembering his own awakening, remained silent. With that power, it was not impossible, he decided.

"Is it possible with Single Digits?"

"If you can do it, you can do it, however, that is just an empty theory. Superb individual strength was good for offense, but not for defense. If one was outnumbered, there would be areas that couldn't be defended. Similarly, it was not appropriate to chase a fleeing enemy. If they spread out and ran away, they would inevitably be missed."

And in this case, it was necessary to eliminate them without letting any of them live. Bernie really had no idea who would be able to do that. Except for one person.

"Common sense tells you that such a thing is not possible, right? But there is someone out there. In the Empire, there is an absolute monster who is able to do it..."

Bernie remembered that figure and trembled with fear. Their beauty and horror could only be understood by those who have encountered them. Bernie, who understood it, felt a little unfortunate.

"...Is it really so frightening to you, a Single Digit? It seems I was mistaken." Minits said, slumping deeply into his chair and looking up to the heavens.

"Me too. I had dreamed of joining the army and ruling the world in the name of the Empire. However..."

However, this was all decided long ago in a place that had nothing to do with the military. From the start, there had been no place for the unawakened in the power game being played by someone else.

"This was foolish."

"Ah. I find myself as ridiculous as a clown."

Calgurio and Minits looked at each other with mournful faces. It was not only Calgurio and the others, but all the senior officers in attendance, who looked as if they had just woken up from a dream they were lamenting. Pathetic---Bernie thought. They would have been happier not knowing the truth, but that would not have satisfied them. That's why Bernie had spoken out of turn.

"Now you understand. Do you see the situation? If you go back, nothing but despair awaits you. So just stay here as prisoners and wait until the war is over."

"Bernie-dono, what are you going to do?"

"I'm going back to the Empire. His Majesty Rimuru will try to sit down to negotiate with the Empire, since the war will not end like this. In that case, they'll need a guide, won't they?"

That guide would probably be wiped out. Bernie, now that he had lost his power, would surely be assassinated. Sensing Bernie's resolve, everyone fell silent. They understood that their destiny was entrusted to the Demon Lord Rimuru.

![hard scene break]

After expressing my gratitude to Veldora and Ramiris, I decided to go to the 70th floor of the labyrinth. Adalmann was in a deep sleep from yesterday's ritual. The Harvest Festival had begun, but Adalmann's castle was still destroyed. As such, he had been taken to the guest room of the main building on the ground floor and put to sleep. Albert and Wenti were also put in an empty room, so they would wake up soon. The problem was the prisoners of the Imperial Army. Adalmann had been in charge of them, and it would be bad to leave them unattended. Besides, I thought I would ask them for information about the Empire, now that things had calmed down. Since it was a good opportunity, I decided to go and check on them. I was accompanied by my two secretaries. With these two, I could rest assured that nothing would happen to me.

"Rimuru-sama shouldn't have to go on his own..."

"Well then, will you go for me?"

"That's right, you go and talk to them!"

"Kufufufufu, then we might as well go together!"

Diablo was as consistent as ever. Was that true of Shion as well? She was never one to leave voluntarily. Well, there was no way I would ever let Shion go alone. I was thinking about this as I was clutched in Shion's arms. By the way, these two were still in good spirits, despite the evolutionary ritual they had gone through yesterday. Shion had not changed at all after one night. And Diablo was back to his perfectly normal self.

"So, did you gain a new Skill?"

"Kufufufu! Thanks to Rimuru-sama, I have succeeded in acquiring an Ultimate Skill! Finally, I don't have to put up with Guy's annoying boasting!"

From Guy's point of view, Diablo must be the annoying one. For some reason, I was absolutely sure of it.

"If you were so annoyed, why didn't you get one by yourself? I think Diablo would have been able to gain an Ultimate Skill without my help, right?"

"No, no, that is not how it works. If Guy told me to get it, it would look like I was copying him, which would be awkward."

I don't get it. This is not about imitation. As long as it's useful, I think it should be fine, but was I wrong?

"Hmph, Diablo is narrow-minded. Didn't the saying go---'hearing is a temporary shame, not hearing is a lifetime shame'? Since Rimuru-sama taught me that, I always listen to what others have to say. Gobichi-dono also taught me the essence of cooking, and now I am fully licensed!"

Shion spoke to him with a smug look on her face. But I think...

I think that was just because Gobichi ran away from him. Please don't give Shion a false sense of confidence. I hope you will take responsibility for Shion and take care of her until the end.

"Is that the reason? The last time, Gobichi-dono was hospitalized. It is only natural for him to get sick if he has to deal with Shion's cooking all the time."

O-oh, I see...

I can't blame Gobichi-kun for that. In this case, Diablo had already undergone a painful experience before, and Shuna would never try to taste it. I knew it had to be Benimaru, after all. That's right, it was Benimaru's responsibility to educate Shion, and I would remind him of it thoroughly. This was not harassment towards a newlywed. I hope you will not misunderstand me.

While we were having such a conversation, we finally arrived at our destination. After I transferred to the hillside of the 70th floor, everyone who saw me immediately stood up and saluted me. I don't think that's the right way to treat a demon lord of an enemy country, however Diablo and Shion seemed to be satisfied, so I didn't linger on it.

"His Majesty Rimuru is here! Contact Sir Calgurio immediately!"

And then everyone began to move with a flurry of activity, and a path was formed as the soldiers lined up towards a single tent. It seemed that Calgurio and his men were currently holding a military meeting in that tent. We were explained this and were led to the tent. Inside the tent, there were about a hundred soldiers. They all stood erect and saluted me, welcoming me.

I was a little surprised to see such a reaction even here. I was, after all, a king of an enemy country, and I am also a slime. I guess Wisdom King Raphael-san's plan was more successful than I had expected, since I was not looked down upon even though I was a slime. Well, it's not surprising if you think about it. Perhaps it is wiser to obey the one who can kill you and bring you back to life. I'm confident that I wouldn't want to go against such a dangerous person either. I agreed that this was the case, and took a seat at the head of the table where I was led.

Of course, in order to look dignified in this place, I took upon a human form. Behind me were Shion and Diablo. Shion looked a little disappointed after I jumped out of her arms. I looked around at everyone and then spoke up.

"So, guys. It's good to see all the top brass here."

" " "Y-Yes!" " "

They all bowed their heads at once, but this made it even more difficult for me to talk to them. I asked them all to be seated and then got down to business.

"All of you relax. I'm here to talk to you guys today."

I said as such and smiled at them. I hoped that this would ease their minds, and that we would be able to have a meeting with a friendly atmosphere.

"Adalmann has some business to attend to and may not be able to come for a while. So, I was wondering if you had any requests."

"You are too kind to say so. We have been well taken care of, so please do not worry about the likes of us."

So stiff! Calgurio answered on behalf of everyone, completely submissive to us. No, rather, I guess this was a normal attitude. They had lost the war, so this was the right thing to do.

"Good. So then, about our future plans..."

"Yes! On that point, we have a request for you as well!"

A request? I hoped it would be reasonable, but I asked him just for the sake of asking. Then Calgurio made a surprising offer.

"We would like to ask for your kindness and cooperation to see if your country can accommodate us for the time being..."

What the...? I listened to the details. According to Calgurio...

They had just now been discussing their future plans. The conclusion they came to was that even if they returned to the Empire, there was a high probability that all of them would be killed.

"No, no, no, you, don't be absurd! What kind of country kills its soldiers who fought for their country just because they lost!"

I was so surprised that I couldn't even think about it.

"However, I think for sure that would be the case."

Look who it is---Bernie. He explained the situation to me in a calm and orderly manner, as if he was not the same person who had previously targeted us. From what he explained, it was difficult to say that such a thing wouldn't happen.

"Hmmm...sacrificing a million people to awaken just one person? You must be kidding..."

"It's true."

"No, wait, wait. If that's true, it sounds unusual that the military invasion was postponed for fear of Veldora's unsealing. Perhaps they were mistaken, and they were actually waiting for Veldora to come back to life?"

"I do not understand what Emperor Rudra was thinking. However, I am of the opinion that His Majesty Rimuru's opinion is correct."

Is this guy really Bernie? He's being polite at a level that makes me wonder if he is a different person. I mean, is he? Emperor Rudra's true goal was not simply to win the war. He wanted to select the strong men who would be awakened by pitting the Empire's soldiers against a powerful enemy. It was too large of a move, and too far out of the ordinary.

<<Answer. A very interesting idea.>>

![break]

You idiot! Using people as experimental materials is not funny at all. Come to think of it, Wisdom King Raphael-san has a side like that, too. Zegion was a correct example of success, but I'm honestly scared that I might be experimented on without my knowledge.

![break]

<<No. No such fact has been confirmed.>>

![break]

Really? Well, I'll believe that part. Anyway, let's put that on the back burner for now. The question was whether or not to accept Calgurio's request.

"But, ah, your meals won't be free either. We'll have to get food for 700,000 people from other countries..."

I hesitated to throw them out when I heard they were going to be killed. However, I really felt that there was no reason to protect them in my country. I was responsible only for my own people. As much as I'd like to say that I wanted them to live well, I couldn't just ignore this, could I? With the influx of 700,000 professional soldiers, the Kingdom of Blumund and other western countries would not remain silent. Even if we don't do anything wrong, there would be unnecessary bloodshed.

That being said, it would be cruel to ask them to return to the Empire. Once you save a life, you should be responsible for it until the end. I had no choice but to take care of them. However, it was impossible to ask me to do so without some sort of compensation.

"In our country, we practice the saying, 'he who does not work does not eat'. I will ask you all to earn your own rations, is that okay?"

Calgurio and the others, who had been watching my response with bated breath, showed bright expressions upon hearing my words.

"Of course!"

"At your service!"

They seemed very motivated, even though they had not yet been told what they were going to be doing. That being the case, I will allow them to stay. In the first place, I had thought that it would be meaningless to take prisoners of war against the Empire. There was no wartime agreement, so there was no agreement at all. And from what Bernie told me, it turned out that they would not be a bargaining chip for the ceasefire. If that was the case, it was better to accept them as a labor force.

The length of their stay was undecided, but at least until the war with the Empire was over, they would work for us. If the period of stay is short, they may be useless, so we would have to wait and see. I could only hope that they would be of some use. Well, Calgurio and the others didn't seem to be willing to go against my words, so I'd leave them with Geld and let him make use of them. However, Geld was currently in an evolutionary slumber. He wouldn't wake up for a while, so I'd have to see what they could do before then...

"By the way, are any of you good at civil engineering?"

The military, surprisingly, had a lot of people who were good with technology. In my previous life, there was a well-known story of a samurai commanding the construction of a castle. Even in modern times, it was reported in the news that the Self-Defense Forces played a great role in overseas relief efforts. Similarly, the Dwargon craftsmen were proud of their advanced technology in this world as well. They were quite fairly normal, but made a huge difference. And it was no exaggeration to say that the foundation of our country was built because of Kaijin, the former commander of such a dwarfish craft unit. In such a way, the link between the military and civil engineering technology were inseparable...

"Of course! We are proud to say that our technology is the best in the Empire!"

Good. In that case, I'll see your skills firsthand.

"Okay, first order of business. The destroyed castle you see before you, I want you to restore it beautifully. I'll get the materials, but I want you to start from the design phase. Can you do it?"

Since they destroyed it, I want them to fix it with their own hands. Calgurio nodded at my request.

"As you wish."

Calgurio nodded confidently, and the men who appeared to be his subordinates began to move in response. The promptness and control of the men were exactly what one would expect from those who were capable of doing their jobs. When Adalmann woke up, the skeletons would also be ready to help, so it seemed that the restoration would be finished in the not-too-distant future. And just like that, I decided to appoint the Imperial Army to the job.

![soft scene break]

Now, the remaining objective was to gather information. Since I needed to make detailed inquiries, I selected some of Calgurio's subordinates who were familiar with the situation and asked them to accompany me to the meeting room. I was planning to hold a meeting to discuss countermeasures with the executives who were still awake. At this point, the Imperialists must not be aware of the defeat of Calgurio's group. Yuuki would have received reports from Misha and Laplace, but it was too much to worry about information leakage from them. And we, for our part, were aware of the Empire's moves.

I had also informed Luminas of the movement of about 300 airships over the sea route.

<Hmph! Let's just see how they'll fight back!> She spoke boldly.

I didn't think Luminas would move on her own, but she still had an agreement with me. Luminas was supposed to prevent the Imperial Army from coming from the north. The Holy Empire of Lubelius was the headquarters of their religion and had produced many Holy Knights. They also had the hidden force of 'vampires' and we could trust them with our lives. In case Luminas was ever in danger, 150,000 Western Reserve Forces would come to her aid. Testarossa's men were standing by to respond immediately. Above all, since Hinata was working with Luminas, we were definitely well-prepared for a crisis. However, we still could not be too careful. I looked around the gathered people and announced the start of the meeting.

![break]

The following seventeen members gathered.

Secretaries Shion and Diablo. Grand Admiral Benimaru. Those in charge of administration---Rigurd and Kaijin. Corp Commanders Gabil and Gobta. Advisor Hakurou. Intelligence officer Souei. Gadra as a key witness. I also called the three demon girls Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera. From the Imperial side, there was Calgurio himself, Minits, and the duo of Bernie and Jiwu. Including me, there were eighteen of us here.

![break]

We started with self-introductions, and when the imperial side learned that Diablo and the three demon girls were 'primordials', they were absolutely mortified. Their stares were very painful. I'm sorry. It was all Diablo's fault, not mine. Sensing the possibility of another complaint, I decided to proceed as if nothing had happened. Let's just get on with it.

"Well, just say as much as you can tell me, okay?"

After saying that, I projected an image of the flying boat squadron with my physical magic : Argus. I ask Calgurio to explain the current situation of the Empire, as I had asked him to do beforehand. The Imperial side faltered when they saw the images on the large surveillance screen. Calgurio remained calm and immediately started to explain the situation. I knew some of the details from Gadra. The old man did not care about the betrayal, but Calgurio was a soldier. He may not be able to tell me some things, so I needed to follow up with Gadra. He told me what he knew and I asked him to explain on that basis.

"I see. Then, let me explain."

Calgurio was more articulate than I had expected. Calgurio's Armored Corps had a division called the 'Air Assault Division', which had a modern air force of 400 ships, called airships. Three hundred of them were currently transporting other corps to the northern part of the Kingdom of Ingracia. Each airship could carry a maximum of 400 passengers. They said that 50 people were enough to pilot the ships, and that each ship could carry 350 people.

This was exactly what Gadra had told me. The force being transported was the 'Magic Beast Corps' of 30,000 men, led by the imperial general named Gladium. However, it seems that they were combined with magic beasts, which could be called their partners. In that aspect, they were actually carrying 60,000 combatants. The rest, it seems, were support personnel who provided logistical support. The command of them was entrusted to a Major General named Zamud, but since he seemed to be a non-combatant, he would not be counted as a force.

"I am ashamed to talk about this here, but most of the men who went to Ingracia were apprentices. They can operate airships, but in actual combat, their accuracy will be quite poor. They should only be engaged in research, so please give them mercy somehow..." Calgurio said.

This time, the full force was put up against our country, so only non-combatants of their rival, General Gladium could be lent. There were about 30,000 such support personnel, but none of them were wizard class, and most of them were sorcerer class. The rest were technicians to maintain the airships. They asked us to take them as prisoners of war without killing them if possible.

"You bastard, there's a limit to what you can do! You invaded our country, and now you want us to help without killing you just because you are about to lose?"

Shion screamed in rage and Calgurio turned pale and apologized. I tried to calm Shion down, but I also thought Shion had a point. Calgurio seemed to understand that well enough and apologized for his mistake...

"It's not up to us to deal with that. Depending on the situation, we may have to ask them to give up."

"Of course, we are aware of that. It will be as Your Majesty Rimuru wills it..."

I'd consider it if I could, but there were no promises. Even my resurrection magic was not universal, and in some situations it was impossible. Besides, depending on Luminas' reaction, I may not be able to do anything. I heard that the threat of the 'Magic Beast Corps' led by Gladium was also considerable, and there was no guarantee that Hinata and the others would not be significantly damaged. If that happened, there would be no time to show mercy. I believed that we would not be defeated since our defense capability was also quite strong, but since there were no absolutes in war, I could not make such a promise so lightly. And that was the end of the story. Next, I wanted to talk about the Eastern city of Dwargon.

![soft scene break]

I switched to the Argus display screen. The image displayed an army of 60,000 men. They were not looking tense, but were all comfortably encamped. I explained the situation to the Imperials, who were again looking at me with shock.

"Currently, an alliance has been formed between Yuuki and me, albeit reluctantly. The fact that we are staring at each other here is just a performance."

As soon as I said this, Minits laughed at himself.

"This is a mess. If a part of the army had been taken from the beginning, there was no chance for us to win."

Calgurio nodded in agreement.

"Yes, that's right. The moment our 'Armored Corps' and Gladium's 'Magic Beast Corps' were gone, they would turn their fangs on the Imperial City. Then it would be checkmate."

The two men's faces were pained as they realized that they had been defeated not only in terms of strength, but also in terms of strategy. However, there were some who disagreed with their statement.

"That's not true. There are still those who protect the Emperor in the capital. I repeat again and again, those who have awakened are equal to an army. I am sure he knew the possibility of Yuuki's rebellion."

Bernie's statement, however, seemed to me to be a different person from Masayuki's old follower because of his strong image.

"Are you the real Bernie?"

"Oh, no. I am actually more like the person I was when I was working with Masayuki."

The question came out of my mouth, and Bernie answered it with a lawful answer. He said that his current attitude was that of a military man, and that he was naturally more open-minded. He also told me that he used to be an American. By the way, he was forty-five years old. He used to be an ordinary student, and the current Bernie was the result of his education after he came here. It was not important information for anyone but him, but I felt a little closer to him.

"Well, now that you put it that way. I've heard that there is someone in the Empire who could kill me, and I wouldn't be surprised if a normally deadlocked situation could be easily overturned."

When you think about it, quality over quantity is the real problem in this world. No matter how much power one gathers, if you can't beat just one person, you will be defeated. Because we had won the war, I would have to consider the opposite situation as well.

"In that case, I'll go over there and give them a good beating!"

Shion spoke boldly with the large sword in her hand. Since there was no guarantee that she could win the fight, of course I rejected it.

"Kufufufu, then I will do it."

"Rejected."

I couldn't imagine a situation where Diablo lost, but I was still going to vote no. My policy was to wait and see until I can create a situation where we can definitely win. I reminded everyone once again to be thorough about this. In any case, the important thing was gathering information. The number of failures due to lack of information was too many to count. I had to make sure that I would not make the same mistake this time.

"So then, you were sticking to Masayuki in order to get close to me without being suspected, right? To tell the truth, I didn't notice it at all, and the timing of the attack was dangerous."

I turned to Bernie and Jiwu. It may have been Damrada's order, but it was a perfect operation that even Wisdom King Raphael-san did not notice. I had to commend him for his skills, even though he was my enemy. I think it was not easy for one to keep their best power hidden until the very moment when they have the chance to kill. This time I had gotten the upper hand, but if anything had been wrong, the situation could have been reversed. If that had happened, things would have been exactly what the Emperor wanted. Without me and Benimaru, Tempest's army would have been overrun by the Empire in confusion.

"I was too confident and careless. I was under the impression that the labyrinth was safe. Now I will always remember to be aware of danger at any time during war."

"Me too. I will make sure that anyone who approaches Rimuru-sama is subjected to a more thorough background check."

Although Benimaru and Souei had been concerned about this for a long time now, it was not their fault alone. They were more alert than I was, expecting every possible eventuality. My lack of sense of crisis was also something I needed to reflect on.

"Damrada-sama ordered me to protect Masayuki. I was not told the reason, so I thought that it was to prevent leakage of information."

"I am the same way. We did not receive the order at the same time, but we were trying to keep our identities secret from each other through different channels. It was only when the assassination order for His Majesty Rimuru was issued that I remembered that Bernie was also a 'Single Digit'."

Bernie and Jiwu joined our conversation. Since I recognized their right to remain silent, I appreciated their willingness to talk. However, I had some concerns about what they said.

"You just 'remembered'?"

"No, I have never met a 'Single Digit' other than myself, so it was only after the order was issued that I learned that Jiwu was one as well!"

"I am the same way. Perhaps, except for the Commander and the Deputy Commander, nobody knows each other's identities."

I was surprised to hear that answer. I was also surprised to hear that the best forces in the Empire did not know each other's identities. Why would they do that?

![break]

<<Answer. The presumed purpose is to prevent betrayal.>>

![break]

*Hmmm.*

If they don't know each other's identity, they can't cooperate with each other and try to overthrow each other. It's not very thorough, but I guess that's how careful they are to protect the Emperor's safety, huh?

"It's understandable, but it also seems wasteful and inefficient. If they are comrades, they should have cooperated with each other from the beginning."

When I said so, Gadra chuckled as he expressed his opinion.

"Rimuru-sama, may I have permission to speak less respectfully?"

"Of course. You're more than welcome to do that."

Now, if you'll excuse me, Gadra said.

"Rimuru-sama's idea is excellent, but it is not very prudent. I know Damrada well, and he is a cunning man. He does not trust his own people, and is very cautious."

It seems that Wisdom King Raphael-san was correct in its reading that this was to prevent betrayal. I remembered that he was one of the heads of the secret society Cerberus and that he only trusted in 'Gold'. And he was a top member of the 'Single Digits'.

"I've never met him, but he seems like a dangerous guy. I was sure he was Single Digit, judging from the way he tried to assassinate Gadra. Besides, if he is in a position to give orders to Bernie and Jiwu, is Damrada the leader of the group?"

When I asked this question, Gadra denied it.

"No, Damrada must be the deputy. I think the leader is definitely Tatsuya Kondou."

As I recalled, he was the director of the Imperial Intelligence Bureau, and one of the people Gadra was on the lookout for. Gadra himself said he did not know much about him. So we did not have much information about him, but I supposed that Gadra was convinced by the revelation of Damrada's true identity. The entire Imperial side was in a mood of resignation, wondering just how much they knew about him. Bernie and Jiwu gave us some useful information, as if they thought there was no point in hiding it now. Gadra was right, Damrada was the vice-commander of the Imperial Guardians and ranked second in the hierarchy. I did not know if Kondou was the leader or not, but I was sure that Damrada was a big shot.

*Good job, Gadra*, I thought as I listened to him.

"Actually, this attack on His Majesty Rimuru was not an order from Damrada-sama, but a secret order from the Commander."

"Same for me. I had a feeling that it was strange because the order to escort Masayuki was overridden."

Jiwu told me that he even prepared a story about the rescue of one village so that Masayuki would trust her. Jiwu says that she finally became one of the guards after Masayuki saved her life and she was given a position of repayment.

"If they were going to reveal themselves at the same time, it would have been better if they had worked together from the beginning."

"I agree with you. I always thought that I was using Masayuki to avoid your suspicion because it was the best opportunity for him..."

Looking back now there are a few doubts---Bernie concluded with some questions. Assuming that their stories were true, it is possible that Damrada and the leader of the group had different intentions. It was hard to believe that Damrada would give an order to completely abandon the entire arrangement when he himself had set it all up.

No, it actually might be a sacrifice to increase the success rate, but I also thought that there could have been a different way to do it. It was natural that Bernie and his colleagues had doubts, and it was natural to think that there was some underlying reason.

"By the way, have any of you in the Empire ever had an audience with Emperor Rudra's face?"

I was curious, so I asked such a question. Only one person, Gadra, raised his hand.

"You're kidding, right? You don't even know the faces of the people you serve?"

Benimaru seemed surprised and muttered in a low voice.

"He doesn't seem like a ruler at all. He is so friendly that he eats from the shops in town and converses with anyone."

"Hey, hey, hey."

"There's no disrespect. King Gazel has his side too, though he's stricter than your side. However, most princes and aristocrats are a little bit more formal. I'm sure there are some who won't show their faces to the lower ranks."

"Well, I guess..."

"I agree with Kaijin-dono's opinion, but there are some points that I don't understand. Hiding your face from those who are supposed to protect you is a bit too much, don't you think?"

"Well, yeah. I feel it's not possible for me to be a part of that."

Rigurd expressed his opinion to Kaijin, to which he readily agreed.

"I guess it's strange, isn't it?"

"It's not so much strange as it is an anomaly. Bernie, if you don't mind my asking..."

Hakurou asked Bernie while answering Gobta.

"What is it?"

"How is it that you, the guardians of the Emperor, do not know the face of your lord? How can you protect your lord?"

Under his sharp eyes, Bernie opens his mouth with renewed spirit.

"It's very simple. Only those in the first six ranks can see His Majesty's face. The Commander and the Vice Commander are often away, and the other four attend His Majesty at all times."

They were called the Four Knights, and as far as Bernie and Jiwu knew, they were so fierce that they had not been replaced for many years.

"In other words, you are not trusted to that extent. Are you inferior to these Four Knights in terms of ability?"

Hakurou asked the hard questions. Bernie answered a little regretfully.

"You may take it that way. It is true that it is difficult for me to win against those four. Not only that, His Majesty, has 'that person' by his side. The fearful Lord Marshal, whom I can never defeat. I don't think we can beat them even if all the Single Digits attack at once."

Here we go again, another powerful person. At the moment, there is Kondou, Damrada, the Four Knights, and now the 'Marshal'. Assuming that there are nine 'Single Digits', there are only seven left, excluding Bernie and Jiwu. The numbers match perfectly---or not. If we separated them by the sixth rank, then it was natural to consider the 'Marshal' as a separate entry. In that case, we should consider that there is another 'Single Digit' who is working separately. In other words, those are the eight members that we should watch out for. If Kondou was a different person from the leader, then we would have one more person to watch out for. This was a very troublesome story. It was good to know about it, but now I wanted to make sure of something else.

"Actually, I heard from Gadra that Masayuki and Emperor Rudra have the same face."

Gadra nodded at my words. Seeing this, everyone remained silent in thought.

"Damrada's order was to protect Masayuki, right? He kept everyone in the dark, making sure that no one would suspect him of anything. And then, the order was given without any regard to the setup. I'm guessing Damrada and the leader had different purposes, right?"

I thought I was sure by now, so I presented my idea. Presumably, I think Damrada really wanted to protect Masayuki. I don't know why, but I am sure it has something to do with the fact that he is a duplicate of Emperor Rudra.

"You said you were using Masayuki, right?"

"Yes. It was unclear why I needed to protect him. That's why I agreed to the Commander's order."

"Same for me. Damrada-sama did not give me any reason."

He was using Masayuki to get close to me. If Damrada had given orders to Bernie and his group, I would have agreed with that idea. However, the fact that the Commander and others intervened raised a question that I had to confirm.

"Do you think that the leader of the group knows about Masayuki's face?"

"Hmmm, that's a difficult question. If Kondou is the leader of the group, as I believe, he must have known about it."

"We don't know the details, but we do know about Kondou. He is an unpredictable man, and it is rumored that he has all the information in the Empire."

"'The monster who eats information' is the nickname given to Lieutenant Kondou, the head of the Intelligence Bureau. We in the military and the Intelligence Bureau have always had a bitter relationship with him. We have tried several times to initiate hostilities, but each time we failed. This is proof that he is not a simpleton."

Calgurio was trying to keep his story under wraps, but Minits had no intention of hiding it. He even revealed the backstory and explained that Kondou was a dangerous man. If a man as good as Minits was like this, then Kondou was probably really powerful.

"At the least, he is not an opponent I could beat."

The old man Gadra was a very strong man. In my opinion, he was as strong as a Saint, if not stronger. Although his magicule count was low, his magic skill-level was outstandingly high. Since such Gadra declared that he could not win, Kondou had to be a Saint for sure. In other words, he was as strong as Hinata and King Gazel. By the way, Bernie and Jiwu were also saints, and Calgurio was also awakened. I didn't think Gadra, who could not use Ultimate Skill, could have won against them. In any case, we know that Kondou is strong. If he was so well-informed to the point that he is called 'the monster that eats information', we should assume that he knew of Masayuki as well.

"If Kondou knew about Masayuki, he must have had a different agenda from Damrada's. Bernie and his group attacked Masayuki with such vigor that they did not care if Masayuki died. This contradicts Damrada's order."

When I said as such, Bernie said something difficult to say.

"...Actually, the Commander had ordered us to 'get rid of Masayuki because he is no longer needed'."

Bernie and Jiwu seemed to have grown attached to Masayuki while traveling with him, and hesitated to kill him. So they were planning to consider how to dispose of Masayuki after killing me. It would be all right if they could hide him somewhere. If not, they were going to use magic to take away his memory. In any case, this confirmed it.

"That means there is something in Masayuki. I feel sorry for him, but we'll have to escort him for the time being. Souei, can I count on you?"

"Of course."

Yup. Souei is still as reliable as ever.

"Damrada and the leader have different agendas. One wants to protect Masayuki and the other wants to eliminate him. The reasons for this are not clear, but it seems certain that they are at odds."

"Yes. It would be a good thing if there was an opportunity to take advantage of it."

"We can't be that optimistic, however, it is good news that our enemies are not single-minded."

Good news, huh? If it was difficult to distinguish friend from foe, we had no choice but to regard both as enemies. Well, I'd just have to hear more to find out.

![soft scene break]

Now that we knew more about Bernie's group, I wanted to understand the factions within the Empire. That being said, I wanted to keep in mind the movements of those who were not in the military but in the upper ranks, those who could handle Ultimate Skills.

"So, tell me about the 'Single Digits'." I asked, and Bernie nodded.

"Yes. There are only nine of us 'Single Digits' at any given time. It is possible that someone you know is being kicked out of the competition so that a stronger person can take his/her place."

In other words, there isn't much of a difference in strength in the end?

"So it would not be surprising if the ninth and tenth places were swapped?"

Bernie shook his head in denial.

"The eleventh in the pecking order is an assistant for 'Single Digit'. And the tenth rank is called 'Spare Personnel'. But it is only temporary. They are responsible for taking the place of the 'Single Digit' members when there is a dropout from the 'Single Digits'."

It is said that there is a big gap between the ninth and the tenth place that cannot be crossed. It seems that it is probably the existence of Ultimate Skill. In other words, it was only when a person had awakened and obtained an Ultimate Skill, that he was recognized as a 'Single Digit'.

By the way, Bernie was ranked 7th and Jiwu was ranked 9th. The correct number to watch out for is at least eight, including the first through the sixth ranks, the eighth rank, and 'Marshal'. Bernie and his colleagues did not seem to know about the Damrada faction. Since they did not even know who the 'Single Digit' beside themselves was, it seemed that their words were not a lie. I wanted to know more information about the other members, so I hoped that we would find something useful to talk about.

"The spare, the tenth rank, is always on call in the home country. If something happens, he is ready to move. And Imperial Knights below 11th rank always work in pairs and are engaged in solving big cases."

According to Bernie's description, the tenth rank seemed to be strong as well. They might even be as strong as an awakened demon lord, just that they had not acquired an Ultimate Skill. The remaining ninety Imperial Knights up to the 20th rank and below the 30th rank also seemed to have a higher difference in strength. Even so, even the lowest level of the Imperial Guardians were of the sage class. Some of the top rankers were even said to be close to the Saint class. If the total power of the Eastern Empire was raised, they would probably be strong enough to wage war against several demon lords at the same time.

"What are you talking about? The one who defeated us without suffering a single casualty..."

It was a push from Minits.

"That's right, but the fact that a hundred Imperial Guardians are more of a threat than an army of a million is also a problem to consider."

"It can't be helped. The Imperial Army is only a visible form of military might. A visible instrument of violence was necessary for the fools who did not understand real strength."

Bernie let out a sigh. This was not only a statement towards the Western countries, but also to his own country, or rather, to the subjects of the Empire, I suppose. The subjects paid taxes in order to guarantee their safety, but to be told that the army protecting them amounted to only a hundred men would make them feel uneasy. It made sense to have a large numbered army, even if it was wasteful. Besides, it was all good when attacking, but more numbers were necessary when defending. The more people you have, the more you need to defend them. In this sense, the policy of the Empire was reasonable.

"In the past, defense was the main purpose of the army's existence, relying on the elite to invade other countries and to take away their will to rebel. Then, the army would be dispatched to rule in the name of the Emperor. However, they later started to send the armies first. I have always wondered why, but I never realized that the purpose was to create more awakened people..."

Gadra was also surprised at this, so it seemed that this had been a very important secret. In this way, one could understand Emperor Rudra's purpose.

"This expedition itself was probably not about achieving victory. In fact, Calgurio-dono was actually awakened, and there were a few others who were likely to be awakened. I think that Emperor Rudra's real purpose in this battle was to increase the number of his pawns."

Benimaru also expressed his opinion, as if he had come to the same conclusion as me. Bernie nodded his head and slipped out a few words.

"There were several subjects on this expedition who were likely to be awakened. Not only General Calgurio, but also Major General Minits, Colonel Kansas, and Krishna. According to the order I received, we were to cooperate with the awakened people to escape. This was the first time I had ever seen the Commander's plan deviate so drastically."

Bernie was smiling at that, but was not amusing to me. If that many people had been awakened, this would have been more than a difficult fight. Besides, now that we knew that the Empire's purpose was to create awakened people, it meant that we had been completely wrong in our judgment. I thought that the Empire had decided to go into this war because they were sure that they could win the war against Western Nations including us. Wisdom King Raphael-san's prediction was the same as mine, and I thought I had not been wrong in my thinking...

![break]

<<...Notice. Definitive conclusion has failed due to insufficient intelligence. To ensure completeness, a new conclusion will be redefined.>>

![break]

Wisdom King Raphael-san seemed to be a little bit embarrassed. Well, it was too much to ask it to decipher things to that extent, and I didn't intend to make outrageous requests either. Don't feel sorry about this, and just learn from the experience to improve next time.

![break]

<<Understood. Information will be reassessed in order to avoid any omissions.>>

![break]

I'm really counting on you. As for the future of the Empire, I would refer to Wisdom King Raphael-san's predictions. For now, I would summarize our opinions on what had been learned.

"Rudra is gathering powerful awakened beings. I hate to admit it, but I think he is able to give people Ultimate Skills like he did to Bernie and Jiwu. With the 'Octagram' including myself and other famous champions of Western Nations, I think he is trying to gather enough people in order to defeat us all at the same time and take over the world."

When I said that, Benimaru and Diablo agreed with me.

"It's tricky, but I agree. That's exactly why they don't care about anyone except for the awakened ones, isn't it?"

"Hmm, indeed. It is true that human beings are weak, but with an Ultimate Skill, they will be able to compete with us."

"I'm not happy about that."

"I don't think it's funny either."

"Well, that's all right. If anything is useful, we can just learn it."

"But that would make the battle less interesting, wouldn't it?"

"Kufufufu, that is an old-fashioned way of thinking, Testarossa. If you are dealing with the have-nots, just don't use the ability either. I think so, and I have already acquired an Ultimate Skill!"

"I beg your pardon?"

"Isn't that cheating?"

"You can't just leave it out."

"The feelings of jealousy of the have-nots is truly delicious! I used to ignore Guy because I didn't want him to feel that way!"

Diablo was really selfish. Just when I thought he was agreeing with me, the conversation took a funny turn. It was about time for me to stop Diablo's rampage because I was starting to feel a pretty disturbing aura from Testarossa and the girls.

"Back to the main topic, in Rimuru-sama's opinion, the purpose of the Empire is to select the strong, right?"

"I also agree with him. There are people who boast of their strength beyond human beings, such as King Gazel, Lady Hinata, and Her Majesty Elmesia. The balance of power in the world has been kept by the protection of such high ranking people. I can understand that it is only after we gather enough numbers to break the balance that the real work begins."

Rigurd and Kaijin had read my thoughts very well.

"I see...to use the strong to deal with the strong, and surround ourselves with those who are able to help us. The weak are nothing but a hindrance."

"It sounds like a terrible story, but it will be easier for the weak."

"Yes, it would be nice for the weak if wars could be settled only by the strong. However, it goes against my aesthetics to make sacrifices to create the strong."

Calgurio and Minits also had bitter expressions on their faces when they heard Gabil and the others' reactions. As for the people concerned, it must have been a very outrageous way of thinking. And I thought Hakurou's opinion was important, too. In war, those who wanted to fight should fight hard themselves. Involving those who were weak was outrageous. But in reality, the world was a difficult place to live in because there were also situations where one could not say so.

"By the way, Yuuki boy told me that Demon Lord Guy also seemed unhappy about the increase in the Imperial battle power. I had wondered why Guy, who is said to be the most powerful man in the world, was so vigilant..."

Gadra spoke, as if suddenly remembering. It is true that if one has an Ultimate Skill, there is a possibility that the attack will reach Guy. It was natural to be cautious.

"Guy's goal is the unification of the world by demon lord forces. The Empire that is trying to oppose Guy's goal is a conflict of interest. However..."

"It's funny. Why does that arrogant Guy tolerate the existence of the Empire?"

"The battle would be more interesting if the strong gathered together, but Guy is surprisingly serious. I have a feeling that if he could, he would just go there personally and eliminate the fools..."

Diablo, Ultima, and Carrera voiced their doubts. Testarossa answered them.

"It's simple. Velgrynd-sama is there. If we touch the Empire, we will be provoking Velgrynd-sama. That is why I've been so quiet in the Empire."

Calgurio, who had been listening, looked surprised, while Minits muttered *'so quiet?'* in a small voice. I don't know what Testarossa has been doing in the Empire, but it has nothing to do with me. I don't want to be blamed for something that happened a long time ago, so I just let that part slide.

What I was interested in was the name 'Velgrynd'. The name 'Velgrynd', could it be---

"What a surprise. I didn't know that White Primordial Blanc---No, Testarossa-dono had so much respect for the 'Scorch Dragon' who lives in the 'burning mountain of the gods'."

Testarossa smiled as if to say, *'What was that?'* and Minits hastened to change his words. This convinced me of Velgrynd's true identity. She is one of only four True Dragons in this world, and the sister of Veldora. The ruler of the 'scorch' and the hidden gem of the Empire...

"'Respect' is not the word I would use. My relationship with the True Dragons was somewhat complicated. However, since our lord Rimuru-sama and Veldora-sama are allies, it is only natural that I should pay my respects to Veldora-sama's sister as well, isn't it?"

In other words, if it weren't for the relationship between me and Veldora, Testarossa would never have paid any respects to the 'True Dragons', right?

"Does that mean that Testarossa was quiet because she couldn't win against Velgrynd? Even so, can't you beat Guy?"

"If you have to decide whether you can win or not, you cannot win. Not mentioning Guy, it is impossible for me to win. It is not a question of strength or weakness, but the fact that the 'True Dragons' are an incomprehensible and indestructible existence."

Just what is the 'True Dragon' race for Testarossa, the incarnation of 'incomprehensible', to speak of them as being that way...

I could picture Veldora proudly laughing out loud, so I hoped she would never say this in front of him.

"Yes, the 'True Dragons' are not even a threat to Guy, but it is impossible to destroy them, right?"

"Well, I'm not sure. At least with magic, I don't think so."

There is no victory as long as you cannot kill them completely---that seems to be common sense among demons. If so, it was certainly impossible to win against a True Dragon. As I recalled, Veldora had also said that. He had mentioned that a 'True Dragon' can come back to life even after death. In the case of demons, you can destroy them by destroying their core, but in the case of 'True Dragon', they would still come back to life. In that case, it seems that a part of memories and personalities are reset...but it may be possible for 'True Dragons' to be resurrected with their memories intact, like some demons. If so, they would literally be 'indestructible'.

"Well, if there was such an opponent in the Empire, we couldn't attack them carelessly, could we?"

Guy may be a threat to some, but he was no threat to us. Calgurio and the others looked at each other in confusion. Then, starting with Calgurio, Minits, Jiwu, and Bernie spoke up in that order.

"With all due respect, I must say something. As far as I know, it is a fact that the Empire worships Velgrynd-sama as a guardian dragon. Even in the history of the Empire, she has been protecting us from angelic attacks. However---"

"It is only because the Empire is paying tribute to Velgrynd-sama, begging her to grant it on a whim."

"That noble and beautiful crimson dragon is a symbol of the prosperity of the Empire. We, 'Single Digits', are required to have an audience with that dragon after being accepted by His Majesty Rudra. We must remember her name and face and show her that we will never be hostile to him."

"Indeed, I have performed that ritual myself. Hostility is impossible. It's not an existence one can win against."

So there was a connection between the Empire and Velgrynd, but it seems that the Empire's side could not ask for anything. Also, I was a bit curious about Bernie's reaction. Well, not just a bit, but a lot.

"Hey, if you don't want to say anything, you can keep it to yourself, but if Velgrynd and that 'Marshal' you were talking about fought, who do you think would win?"

"---What?"

"Let me rephrase that. Perhaps, did you ever feel similar signs coming from both of them, or did you ever remember something like that?"

"No way..."

Bernie seemed to get my point and tried to laugh it off. But he failed to do so and made a serious face. Next to Bernie, Jiwu was also pondering with a pale face. I was sure of it now. The 'Marshal' was really the 'Scorch Dragon' Velgrynd. The reason why Demon Lord Guy does not attack the Empire is because of Velgrynd. And perhaps the Empire had some other threat as well as Velgrynd. Otherwise, I think Guy would have little reason to stay put. I looked at the big screen and let out a sigh.

"Good grief, A rash move would only provoke Velgrynd, and sending an army against them could result in being annihilated at once. If this is the case, an invasion operation in cooperation with Yuuki's group would only be the height of recklessness."

Sure enough, information is really important. By becoming aware of Velgrynd's existence, we were able to stop before stepping on a landmine. As tempting as it was to win peace with the Empire, launching a counterattack would only be a fool's errand.

"If Veldora-sama's sister is to be our enemy, who among us could win? Shall we ask Veldora-sama to come?"

That was Benimaru's statement. As timid as that sounded, this was only the result of calm judgment. A 'True Dragon' is an existence that surpasses even the existence of the gods, and those deluded into thinking they can win in a fight were blind to the reality.

"Well, I'm not sure about that. I don't want to involve Veldora in our own affairs."

I decided that I would not ask Veldora to fight with me, as I would not want to fight with my own brother and sister. In that case, I was not entirely sure what to do from here.

"I will have to inform Yuuki boy of this information. I am sure that the army he has deployed will not be able to stay forever."

"Yes. We need to rethink our strategy and keep in touch with Yuuki."

Hmmm...my mind was racing with thoughts. Just then, Diablo, the troublemaker, dropped a metaphorical bomb.

"It seems that Guy is also involved, so I called him up. He should be here soon, so let's hear what he has to say!"

*...Huh?*

I couldn't help but put on a blank face and stare at Diablo. I was almost ready to kill him when he showed me his bashful expression. What kind of unnecessary thing is this idiot doing to me at a time when things are so troublesome...

"You called him?"

"Yes!"

*Yes?! No!!*

I was so irritated, but this couldn't be ignored. In any case, I would break up the meeting for now, and prepare for Guy's visit.

![soft scene break]

Guy arrived and seemed to be in a bad mood.

"Hey, I'm here. By the way, it's a pretty big deal to call me over, isn't it?"

You're right. But alas, I wish you'd say that to Diablo, not me. Guy sat down roughly in his chair. I showed him to the luxurious drawing room of the guest house to avoid offending him, but I may have been too hasty. The guesthouse was a place where only royalty and aristocrats were allowed to visit. It would be a great loss if anything went out of control here. The furnishings in the guesthouse were selected by Myourmiles-kun, who was well known for his aesthetic sense. There were also some valuable art works from various countries. The pieces were more modest than showy and were in accordance with my taste. The wabi-sabi atmosphere of the rooms showed the high sensitivity of Myourmiles. Rigurd and his friends were not yet old enough to reach this level. Since they did not have a chance to touch art works, they would not be able to understand the high-end and low-end aesthetics of things so easily. That said, Rigurd had mentioned 'feeling a sense of home' in this place, so we might have the same taste.

Anyway, let's leave it at that for now and only worry if Guy actually gets out of control. As there was no other room suitable for him, I decided to accept a certain amount of damage. There was no way I could do such a daring thing as to lead Guy, the strongest demon lord, to a common reception room.

![break]

The chair was making a small creaking sound. It was carved from aromatic wood of the finest quality. Although soft sofas were nice, the wooden chairs that withstood everything were quite comfortable. They gave off the feeling of being surrounded by the forest and one with nature. I thought in relief that it would be nice to let everyone else leave and just let Diablo make amends.

The imperial team was sent back to the 70th floor. Gabil had been assigned as a guide and would take care of Adalmann in his absence. Souei was to arrange for Masayuki's escort. Rigurd was in charge of contacting all the parties concerned to ensure the smooth operation of the city center that had been evacuated in the labyrinth. Kaijin, after consulting with Vesta, asked him to inform King Gazel of the meeting we had just had. I would contact him later as well, since I did not want to hide anything from him. Gadra was to exchange information with Yuuki. He thought it was necessary to communicate the current situation in order to decide the future course of action. Gobta and Hakurou were waiting in the other room. In order to deal with any problems that may arise, the three demon girls were also asked to join the waiting group. It would be safer to keep them out of Guy's way because of what they might do. That was the reason why I took this measure.

And so, four of us moved to the reception room. Me, the culprit Diablo, and then Benimaru and Shion. Guy, on the other hand, appeared with three women. Sitting next to Guy was a woman with a face similar to Milim's. Her lustrous white hair refracted light like a sparkling lake and her eyes were a deep blue. She was a stunningly beautiful woman, but she also seemed a bit young and childish depending on how you looked at her. There was no hierarchical relationship between Guy and herself seeing as she sat down naturally and without any concern. In other words, they were of the same rank, and such an existence was extremely limited. Perhaps she is...

"This is the first time you've seen each other. I'll introduce you. This is Veldora's sister, Velzard. Her other name is the Frost Dragon, so you'll have to remember them both."

"Nice to meet you, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama. My name is Velzard. I wanted to come and say hello to you since my brother seems to be in your care."

I was right. She is Veldora's sister and one of the most powerful 'True Dragons'. She was the Frost Dragon Velzard. Her graceful greeting was beautiful. The elegant way she sat on the chair was very picturesque. It seems that she was satisfied with the fragrance of the wood. However...

Although she showed an elegant smile, I could feel a cold sweat running down my spine. I thought I was familiar with the 'True Dragon' race after seeing Veldora every day, but this girl was something else. She was a dangerous woman who felt like a being from another dimension. Veldora had finally been able to control his youki with considerable accuracy pretty recently. I thought it was perfect too, but seeing Velzard-san standing in front of me made me realize that I had been naive. She was controlling her youki in an extremely natural way. The fact that she did not give me any sign of her presence showed just how much control she had over her youki. If I had not been introduced to her, I would never have recognized her as a 'True Dragon'. On the contrary, I might have believed her to be a human being. However, I could never have underestimated her, because her beauty and her power could not be hidden.

"Ah, hello. My name is Rimuru. I'm a demon lord. Your brother has always been a great help to me."

Why do I always greet people like this? And why is the Wisdom King Raphael-san remaining silent at a time like this? One side tried to be friendly to her, while another was thinking this was just irrational.

"Oh, dear, you're so modest. You don't have to be so defensive of me."

Velzard-san chuckled, looking pleased. At that moment, her calm and collected aura faded away, and her image transformed into that of a cute girl. To be honest, she looked just like a high school girl. Once again, I strongly recognized that she was related to Milim. I was saved by her smile as the heavy atmosphere was eased. The greetings proceeded, and we introduced all the respective members.

The other two were Mizeri the Green Primordial (Vert), whom I had met before, and Raine the Blue Primordial (Bleu), whom I had never met before. They were dressed in dark red maid uniforms as usual, and stood behind Guy without a moment's notice. They seemed to be of the same rank as Diablo and the others, though it didn't seem that way from the way they stepped back. Even so, there was no mistaking a 'primordial'. They were the strongest among the demons, and they were definitely different from mere demon peers. I would be very careful not to get a bad response from them. With such determination, I carefully finished the introductions. Benimaru who sat next to me was fine, but I was nervous when introducing Shion. I felt like I was handling bombs by the time I got to Diablo. I regretted choosing this lineup, but it was too late now.

![soft scene break]

When everyone had taken their seats, I asked Shuna, who was showing people around, to prepare some tea. Shuna understood what was needed and did her job without showing any signs of agitation. No, not just Shuna, but all of the servers were doing their jobs as usual, as if it didn't matter who they were serving. They had become professionals. This was all the result of Vesta's strict training. After taking a break with a cup of tea brought by Shuna, we moved on to the main topic.

"The reason I asked you to come today is, of course. I wanted to ask Guy something."

"What's that?"

"Well, the Empire attacked us and we fought them off. And now we were thinking of invading from our side, but then we heard that Velgrynd is---ah, your sister is in the Empire too. And judging from the information I've gathered, I think there might be some kind of a connection between you and the Empire..."

"Oh, you've noticed."

Guy grinned happily at my explanation. I had a bad feeling about this. I didn't want to hear any more about it, but I guess that's no longer an option...

"You've been trying to hinder the Empire from increasing its strength. That was your purpose for keeping Yuuki alive, wasn't it? I know that you did not want to destroy Western Nations, but that's not the only reason, right? You mentioned a 'game' before, so who are you playing against?"

I was concerned about it, but I pretended not to be. However, if Velgrynd was in the Empire, or if a threat of equal magnitude was lurking in the shadows, I couldn't help but ask. If I invaded without knowing about it, there's a good chance that my people would be killed. I looked Guy straight in the eye and asked him the question.

"Kukuku, if you've noticed that much, I'll tell you!"

Guy answered without hesitation. I felt scared about that, but I listened to him quietly.

"Actually, I made a bet with some asshole. That guy talked so much about crazy ideals that I wanted to show him reality. And so, we decided not to fight each other directly, but to play a game against each other with only the pawns we have."

In other words, leaving someone other than yourself to fight and defeating all of your opponent's pawns means you win.

"The 'pawns' in your hands refers to...?"

I was already aware of it without asking.

"Well, it's you guys."

Right. That's what I thought. I wish people would stop using me as a pawn, but I can't start complaining here. Let's just be reasonable and try to get some useful information.

"So, your opponent is the Emperor of the Empire?"

I'm sure I was right, but I wanted to check. Since Velzard was sitting next to Guy, the one sitting next to Velgrynd must be the opponent of the game. However, that wasn't necessarily the Emperor, so I would have to find out from Guy's mouth exactly who it was.

"Correct. Emperor Rudra of the Empire is my recognized rival."

Guy was happy to tell me, as if he had no intention of hiding it. Since he said he was his rival, does it mean that this Rudra is as strong as Guy? He couldn't win otherwise, right? There was nothing worse than participating in a game in which there was no clear path to victory.

"May I speak?"

Beside me, Benimaru spoke up without fear. While right in the presence of Guy, Benimaru was amazing.

"Yeah, all right."

"Then allow me to ask, what are the conditions for winning this game? Do you have to defeat Emperor Rudra, or do you just have to conquer all of his pawns?"

Oh, well, that was certainly important. I was under the impression that we had to defeat Rudra, but if we could win the game just by neutralizing his pawns---in other words, the Empire's forces---then we had a much better chance of winning. There were still some nasty guys left, but it was better than facing someone on the same level as Guy.

"Kufufufu, one solution here is to get rid of Guy..."

" "You idiooot!" "

I couldn't help yelling at him, and Guy's angry voice overlapped with mine. It's exhausting, really. Guy must have felt the same way as I did, because we both nodded at one another. I was actually grateful to Diablo for that, because I never expected to relate to Guy in such a way. That said, I'd have to take away some points for saying something that could potentially offend Guy. In any case, I told Diablo to keep quiet for a while.

"So, Guy, what about the answer to Benimaru's question?"

Guy looked at me without answering. The moment his mouth broke into a smirk, my 'Danger Detection' sense echoed an alarm in full force.

"Rimuru-kun!"

Whoa, I have a super bad feeling about this. This was more than just a premonition. I seem to understand why Myourmiles and Veldora always make subtle expressions whenever I call them with "-kun". I was sure that I had that very same expression on my face right now.

"Actually, I have a favor to ask you."

"I refuse."

"Well, just listen."

'You listen to me'---is what I wanted to say.

As tempting as it was, this was still Guy. It was not a good idea to make this arrogant person angry, so I had no choice but to listen to him. Myourmiles-kun, on the other hand, always seemed to be happy to hear from me even with that subtle expression on his face. In my case, I was filled with a desire to reject Guy with all my might.

"I want you to stop that bastard Rudra. I won't ask you to beat him, but just figure out a way to deal with the pawns and make sure I win!"

Guy spoke, looking as evil as ever. He got up out of his chair and walked behind me. Giving my shoulders a squeeze, he continued talking.

"You'll do it, won't you?"

The hand that rubbed my shoulder grew stronger. Is this a threat?

![full page image](image6)

"What's in it for me if I do what you're asking?"

Since I couldn't refuse, I wanted to at least get better conditions. It might be reckless with Guy, but I decided to negotiate as much as I could.

"You know, you're the one who upset the balance of the world I've been managing. What do you have to say about that?"

"I'm sorry."

In an instant, I was completely defeated. It's true that I was the one who took most of Guy's forces, even though it was just to build a new balance. To put it more bluntly, it was a bad idea to bring Testarossa and the others to my side. If I refused Guy's request, there was still a danger that I might be regarded as an adversary. There was no way around it. I gave up and decided to accept Guy's offer.

![soft scene break]

Just as Guy was returning to his seat, a knock came from the door. The door opened and Shuna entered. The smell of tea filled the air, and the tension faded away. There was a cake on the tray, and we decided to take a break. This was definitely not a postponement of the problem, as I had decided that there was no escape now. The two secretaries and the two maids went to the next room, which also had tea prepared. I thought they would be reluctant, but they moved more easily than I expected.

I took a sip of the tea Shuna made with care. It tasted gentle. The one Testarossa brewed was perfect and complete, but this one was very tasty and comforting.

"Ho-ho, this is pretty good, isn't it?"

I was glad to hear that Guy was very satisfied with the meal.

"Oh my, it's true. This cake is not only sweet, but also has layers of depth. The mellow aroma is wonderful, and the bitterness complements the sweetness."

I was relieved that Velzard-san seemed to like it as well.

"Also, this room is furnished in a style that is to my liking."

Surprisingly, Guy gave me a compliment. I had assumed that he was a tyrant and had no interest in wabi-sabi^[Wabi-sabi refers to traditional Japanese aesthetics.]. I needed to reflect on the fact that I should not judge others based on my preconceptions. Come to think of it, I think Oda Nobunaga^[Oda Nobunaga was a famous Daimyo during the Sengoku period of Japan.] also had this kind of taste. It seems that he liked to spend time in a tearoom where he did not have to worry about his status, and he may have valued that time to reflect on his thoughts. Well, that was just my own contrivance, but it seems that I was right to show Guy to this place. I was a little relieved, so I spoke up to elicit his next reaction.

"Ah, is that so? I'm glad you like it. You're the first person I've shown here. This is the finest parlor we have, and I only show it to people I want to impress."

"Yeah? Are you trying to impress me?"

"Yes, I am. Without that, one can't be a demon lord. If I could give up my pride, I'd have lived happily behind the scenes from the beginning."

First, a jab. Before Guy's request was heard, I would show him that I would not be at his beck and call. Depending on his reaction, I needed to change my response to Guy. But Guy laughed off my reaction as excessive.

"Ahaha. You're trying to get to know me, aren't you? You're so funny!"

It wasn't funny, but I still felt like I was being played in the palm of Guy's hand.

"Thanks for that."

"All right, no trouble. Asking for help is not irrelevant to you. I want you to continue the war and destroy the Empire."

Having said that, Guy sipped his tea with a graceful motion. He looked good, like some kind of king. Actually, he's a demon lord, so I guess he is a king. But, Guy...

He went straight to the point there.

"In other words, reduce Rudra's pawns to zero without killing Rudra? I had a hunch that it was when you were reluctant to answer Benimaru's question."

"That's it. As for the conditions for winning the game, they are not that strictly defined. The only rule we had was that the players must not directly fight each other."

"The victory condition is that the opponent must admit defeat, die, or the game cannot continue, whichever comes first, right?"

"Well, that's the way it's going to be."

Guy nodded his head while sipping his tea again. According to him, Emperor Rudra of the Empire and Guy had been fighting each other for more than 2,000 years. Though they had been fighting, there had been no direct confrontation. They used to fight each other many times before, but after Milim was born and Veldanava, the 'Star King Dragon', disappeared, they began to be cautious of each other. The reason for this was that their battles had so much impact on the world that they could no longer be serious about them. It sounded far-fetched, but seeing Guy in front of me, I knew that it was not a lie. And so the battle had continued until now.

Guy had been increasing his pawns while keeping the world in balance. It seems that he had been waiting for the slow evolution of many long-lived monsters. However, even among the 'Octagram', no one knew about Guy's true intentions. Even Milim did not know anything about Guy and Rudra's game.

"Then why are you telling me?!"

"Ahhh? It's obvious. You're the first person to push Rudra this far."

Needless to say, Guy was aware of the fact that the Imperial Army had been annihilated. Well, it would be strange if Guy didn't notice that since so many large magic attacks had been made...

"But you were right to kill them all. Rudra's got no pawns awakened."

Do Guy knew the purpose of Rudra's actions after all. Guy told me the exact story. Rudra's purpose was, after all, to make the survivors awaken by giving them an ordeal of defeat. Rudra's basic tactic was to find those who would awaken from among the survivors by giving a reason to convince the subjects, training the army, and then exposing them to threats. As proof of this, the last imperial expeditionary force had been swept away by Veldora, and it was said that some of them had evolved into sages.

Guy had adopted a similar strategy. Those who had not yet awakened were not worth using as pawns. Guy thought that way and he allowed the demon lords to fight with each other. The more people who awakened to become true demon lords, the more advantageous the game became. That was the basic premise of the game, and it was just a matter of timing. The moment you decide that you are definitely better than your opponent, that is the moment to bet. This was surprisingly difficult and sometimes interfered with by the opponent. In that way, the game had continued to be fought without a win until now.

For both Rudra and Guy, it was a long story of patience with a grand long-term plan. It was a nuisance to those who lived in this world, but I guess it was just a way to pass the time for both of them...

"In this case, too, if there were even a few dozen survivors against Veldora, it was expected that some of them would be awakened."

In other words, Rudra didn't care about me. I was just one of Guy's good pawns. It was a little frustrating, but this was the reality.

"So, you want me to take this opportunity to attack the Empire?"

"I'll leave that to you. I don't need to say it, but fighting in vain is meaningless."

Indeed, while disheartening, that was the truth. If the show of force was not a threat, it would only increase the number of casualties and would have no strategic meaning. I rejected the idea of sending an army.

"If you know, then tell me, do you know of any opponents among Rudra's forces that we should be on the lookout for?"

"I don't know. I was mainly concerned with how well I could play my own cards. If I am the best, then it doesn't matter how strong or weak my opponent's hand is."

It was an arrogant statement befitting of the strong. This guy, he's definitely that type isn't he? He's like a mahjong player who doesn't even look at his opponent's discarded tiles, and just when one thinks they've got an easy win, he'll pull a yaku mangan^[Basically, the mahjong player will pull a move to gain a ton of points at once.] without a care in the world. Well, Masayuki might get a tenhou^[Getting a ton of points, but on the first tile draw.] just with good luck, so I didn't want to play with him either since both of them were the same. The game topic was making me use strange associations, but let's just get to the point.

"Either way, we need to be clear about the Empire. I'm going to do what I believe in, not what you want me to do."

Since we couldn't postpone the problem, we'd have to talk to Emperor Rudra. It would be wiser for us to go to Emperor Rudra in a favorable situation.

"Rimuru-sama, are you planning to go there yourself?"

Benimaru looked surprised, but I was not going to give in.

"We don't have a choice. We can't abandon Yuuki and the others, so we should join them and try to make peace on our own terms."

"Isn't that dangerous?"

"Either way, it will be dangerous. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that someone goes out there and does make peace. Would you believe that?"

I wouldn't. I would be convinced that it was just a ruse to throw us off guard. Then they'd try to assassinate me in secret when I was out and about. If that happened, I'd have to keep my guard up all the time, and I wouldn't be able to achieve my goal of a carefree life. I would not allow such a thing to happen, so I had to make sure to settle the matter here.

"That's true. And the escort?"

"Of course, it's you."

Benimaru smiled at my words.

"Then that's fine."

His attitude was full of confidence that he could and would protect me. Sure enough, Benimaru was reliable. Guy laughed amusedly at the exchange between me and Benimaru.

"Hahaha. You're fun to watch, but your subordinate is fun too. There's something strange about him, and I think he still has a lot of room to evolve."

"Well, you know. Benimaru is my most reliable right-hand man."

"Oh, so it wasn't Diablo?"

"Ahhh, that guy is strong, but he's kind of a problem child..."

"I know what you mean."

I felt that Guy was deeply sympathizing with me. And for some reason, he was even treating me as one of his friends. I understood from his reaction that Guy was also having a hard time.

"So, I just want to confirm one thing."

"What is it?"

"Rudra can grant Ultimate Skill to others, right?"

Guy's eyes narrowed in admiration when I asked him this.

"So you noticed. You're right, Rudra does have an interesting skill, and he can lend his power to others."

I knew it.

"So, do you know what the terms of the loaning are?"

This was very important. If Guy knew the conditions, we would be able to narrow down the list of key members on the imperial side. I was wondering if there were less than ten people on the list, but one could never be too sure.

"Don't worry. His Skill is not all-powerful. He can only lend a limited, degraded power. As for the receiver, one cannot be the recipient of the power unless they have awakened. There are also conditions that I don't know about, but they probably aren't threatening."

Guy gave me a quick answer when I asked him if he thought it would be a good idea. Now I had all the information I wanted to know. Or rather...

I wanted to shout at him that he was the only one who could say that an ultimate skill holder was not a threat. Perhaps Milim was one of Guy's kind too...

Such a difference of feelings may complicate things. I was indignant when I saw Guy eating the cake served to him. I was angry at his appearance that didn't match what he said, but I was also annoyed at the way he made things become someone else's problem as soon as I accepted his request. Wait a minute, we were supposed to be talking about something quite important right now. I thought so, but it seemed that the secret talk was over. In frustration, I stabbed a fork into my cake. Sugar was important for thinking. I decided not to be distracted by Guy, but to calmly sort out the information.

![soft scene break]

A time of silence. The air is calm. But...

Guy doesn't seem to be going home, even though his business is over. Shuna deftly poured a refill into Guy's empty cup. It seems that she had prepared a separate pot for serving to prevent the remaining tea leaves from over-brewing.

"You're good at what you do! My idiots can't do this much!"

"Thank you very much for the compliment."

Benimaru looked a little worried, but Shuna was magnificent. She was not intimidated by Guy and handled him without hesitation.

"My Mizeri and Raine, can I send them to your place for training for a while?"

"Training?"

"Right. I want them to learn how to make this cake."

Their food at Walpurgis had been quite good, but Shuna's was a step above the others when it came to sweets. After all, she has been working hard to develop new dishes competing with Yoshida-san, and her skills were getting better and better. I thought that this was only normal, but now I realized that it was quite a luxury. I realized that I had just been doing whatever I wanted since I came to this world. I tried to reproduce what I liked...I tried to make good food...

No matter how much passion and skill one has, there are recipes that cannot be reproduced without the right ingredients. Even an excellent person like Yoshida-san succeeded in reproducing this cake only with the good quality alcohol produced in our country. For this, I should not forget to express my gratitude. In any case, what should I say to Guy? I thought of telling him to come and buy it, but I guessed there was no need to be so stingy. And so, I decided to tell him only the recipe we developed, while hiding what Yoshida-san told me.

"Shuna, can you show the two people in the next room how to make it later?"

"Yes, with pleasure!"

"You'll need to use good ingredients, so let's make a deal on that in the future."

Even the sugar was refined so that there were no impurities in it. The combination of my dedication to good taste and the technical skills of Kaijin and the others had resulted in a quality that was as good as what I had in my previous life. Although we did not have enough to distribute in the market, we had enough for our own enjoyment. I would add a little more production, and arrange for Guy to have some of it as well.

"Are you sure?"

"Of course."

I meant it. I was not willing to skimp when it came to our products, let alone our technology. What worried me was that we may have more troubles if Guy went in and out of our country...but that would not be a problem because he had people like Mizeri who could handle a 'portal'. If we prepared the materials, we wouldn't have to consider the transportation. And, I had other intentions.

If Guy finds us useful, it will ensure the safety of our country. The deeper our relationship with foreign countries is, the more it will lead to our security. If there was a mutual need, there would be no need to use force against each other. An economic circle was equivalent to a strong military alliance. That was my theory. I didn't want to get into trouble with Guy, so the more cards I had in my hand, the better. After all, I had never been so careful about my opponents before.

Or perhaps it was the second time, after the time I met Veldora. Whether I could win or not, if we had a fight with them, it would be too much trouble. I was going to respect Guy's opinion as long as it was not too much of a problem. There may be times when Guy would ask me to do something reckless, as he did this time, but I would just have to accept it. But there was a limit to that...

After several conversations with Guy, I realized that he was not the tyrant that I thought he was. He was surprisingly rational and understanding. With the way he was dealing with Diablo, I could see his hard-working side. I trusted that he would realize our usefulness and would not make any unreasonable demands. And so, I hoped he would go home soon. My little wish was cruelly scattered by Guy's words.

"Wait. Before I leave, I need to ask you something."

What? What else is going on?

"What is it?"

"Why has Diablo evolved?"

Surprise!!! I was hoping it wouldn't be discovered, but I guess that was a little naive. This is why I don't like observant people.

"Well, that's..."

What should I do? How do I answer Guy's question?

"Diablo isn't the only one either, right? It took me a while to find out the signs because they were in Ramiris' labyrinth, but why are there so many awakened 'True Demon Lords' here?"

Guy asked me this with a smile, but his eyes were not smiling at all. I guess my poor attempts at deception were not going to work...

![break]

<<Answer. It is safe to say that this is the result of experimentation with the 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth', the Master's power.>>

![break]

The voice of heaven is here...!

Okay, let's go with that. As expected of the Wisdom King Raphael-san. Reliable Wisdom King Raphael.

![break]

"Actually, about that... I've been experimenting with my powers to see if I can strengthen my forces for the decisive battle against the Empire. And it turns out that my powers have an interesting effect."

"Oh. What kind of effect?"

What kind of effect does it have? I don't know. Teach me, Wisdom King-sensei!!!

![break]

<<Answer. This is an effect that reduces souls into energy and grants them to those who are qualified for awakening. Guy Crimson will agree if you explain that this is how the forced evolution is promoted.>>

![break]

You're right on the money. Indeed, the evolutionary ritual was not based on the power of the 'Wisdom King Raphael' but on the power of the 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth'. So, I was just telling the truth without hiding anything. Indeed, that may be the right response.

"My power, 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth', can reduce a person's soul to energy, and I can give it to others. It is a meaningless act for those who are unqualified..."

"Hmm. Does it mean that a person who has obtained the Demon Lord Seed can attain awakening? That's amazing."

Guy didn't need to hear all of it to be convinced, probably because the explanation was not false. All this was thanks to Wisdom King Raphael-san.

"Well, I guess. In this world of warfare, quality triumphs over quantity, right? It's only natural that we should improve our individual abilities."

"That makes sense. By the way, I've always wondered about you, but you're not normal, are you?"

"Huh? I'm very normal."

"No, no, no. Ordinary 'slimes' don't even talk. I didn't think much before, but the way you got Veldora to go along with the development of this town, whatever it is, it's not normal. You're a reincarnated person, aren't you?"

"Hmm? Huh, you didn't know? I died in a different world and was reborn as a slime with my consciousness."

"Seriously?"

"Seriously."

Guy and I stared at each other. It turns out he didn't know. I thought that story had been known for a long time. It was not a secret, rather, it was public knowledge and was well known in the Western Nations. I had assumed that Guy knew about it. It might be a good idea to assume that the other party knows all the information. While not exactly an understatement, I would pay attention to it from now on. I'd have to be careful not to give away information by unintentionally offering something unexpected.

"Really?"

"Yes, it's true."

"Rimuru-sama is not lying!"

Hey, come on, why are you so suspicious? Even confirming with Benimaru and Shuna...

"Ahahahahaha! That's awesome! I thought you were an odd one for a monster, but I didn't expect it to be like that. It's rare to be reincarnated to this world, let alone reincarnated as a monster. You've got no luck at all, do you?"

Guy was giggling like a gibbering idiot. It's not that funny.

"But that makes sense. If a soul alone can 'cross the boundary' and keep its ego and memories, then it must be able to train its core. I can also understand why you are so obsessed with your human form, and it's possible that you evolved at an abnormally fast pace and acquired the Ultimate Skill."

In short, my mind was strong, was it? I guess so. I'm a pretty strong guy, if I do say so myself. I never give up, I never give in, and I always think positively.

"I hope you can accept it now."

"Yeah, I always thought you were shady, but now I know I can trust you."

That's seriously rude. But I forgive you. Because I can't beat you. Besides, it's better than being treated as an enemy. This is an example of positive thinking.

"Well then, it seems your suspicions are confirmed, and you've heard what you wanted to hear. You probably want to go back..."

"I'll have another one of these."

"Yes, of course."

I was about to ask him to leave quickly. However, Guy interrupted me and brazenly asked for a second cake. Shuna responded in a nonchalant manner. I had no choice but to also ask for another piece of cake. The sweetness of the cake soothed me. I thought so, but Guy didn't allow me to do that.

"So, Rimuru-kun, let's get back to the story we were talking about earlier."

I can see it. This is definitely a bad thing.

"Huh? What story?"

"The story of how you awakened your men. From what you just said, it sounded like you could share your power with my subordinates. Is that possible?"

This guy...

Is he really just like me? For example, the way he's always on the lookout to make the most of everything that's useful. The way he catches you off guard when you're done talking, and then how he just cuts right to the point. No, no, on, I'm not as obvious as this---am I? Well, the moment I start caring about it, I'll lose. More importantly, I have to answer Guy's question. I'll tell him...

![break]

<<Answer. It's possible.>>

![break]

Ah, it answered before I could ask the question in my mind. I felt a little sad. It felt like it was trying to show me how tired it was of dealing with me.

![break]

<<Answer. No such intention.>>

![break]

It seems a little, well, angry. I didn't want to offend them any more than I already had. I can only put my trust in Wisdom King Raphael-san, and there is nothing I can do if it gives up on me here. Now then, that leaves the question. Guy's servants do not have a Soul Corridor connected to me, is that still okay?

![break]

<<Answer. Yes. Forced intervention is now possible even for monsters who are not part of the 'soul lineage'. There is a condition that the target does not resist, but as long as it qualifies for awakening, you can promote its evolution by applying energy to it.>>

![break]

Got it. Then there's only one problem left. The number of souls I have. I don't know how many men he wanted to awaken, but it would be impossible if I was missing something vital.

"I don't think there's a problem. We won't know for sure until we try, but it should be fine. However, I don't have enough energy left to share."

I answered in such a way that I could refuse Guy without offending him. In fact, I had a little more than a hundred thousand left, but Guy couldn't know that. I was sure he'd give up now.

"Oh. That means you can do it if you have souls, right?"

"Well..."

There's no sign of giving up?

"As a matter of fact, I once gave Mizeri about 10,000 souls. But since they didn't react or show any sign of awakening, I decided that it was all for naught."

Demons were very dexterous in giving souls, weren't they? But, wouldn't this cause them to awaken?

![break]

<<Answer. In order to promote evolution, it is necessary to transform the soul into what it should be and adapt it to the target. It is impossible to make effective use of the soul if you just give it to the subject. In addition, the effective value of the soul is about 10 percent, because the energy efficiency is very low when it is given to others.>>

![break]

I see. In order for the 'Demon Lord Seed' to germinate, you need to water it correctly. Well, even if you know the right way to do it, whether you can do it or not is another story. In that case, would it be better for my subordinates to awaken voluntarily?

![break]

<<No. A monster named by a higher being will have its nature changed. Even if it is a soul acquired by itself, it will not be awakened.>>

![break]

In other words, the path of evolution is closed when naming occurs. It was hard enough work just to be qualified, but there were unexpected pitfalls. However, most monsters may not be able to qualify, and evolution by naming was also quite common, so it was hard to say if that was a good or bad thing. In any case, a monster who has been named will not be able to extract the energy suitable for itself from the souls it has acquired, because its nature will be different. Guy didn't seem to know that, and I admired Wisdom King Raphael-san's knowledge. It is truly a good teacher.

![break]

<<...>>

![break]

Oh, no, no, no. I was quite serious in praising it, but it might be taken as more than a compliment. Now that I knew the answer to Guy's question, it was time to move on.

"So it was Mizeri-san. Is Raine-san another person you tried it with?"

"I told you to call them whatever you want."

That wasn't permission, but an order.

"I'll do that next time. So, about those two guys, weren't you the one who 'named' them?"

"So you know about that. That's right."

"Then that's the reason why."

"Huh?"

"It seems that one's nature is changed when he is named by a higher being."

"...Hmm. So that's what happened. Then all the souls I gave them were for nothing. So then, you can adapt your energy to the nature of your opponent?"

Guy understood very quickly even though I struggled to explain it to him. Moreover, he was correct without any errors.

"That's about it."

"Well, then, I have a favor to ask you."

I just knew it would turn out this way. I was starting to get a feel for Guy's personality. Guy was requesting with a purr, but he definitely never thought once that I might refuse...

I wanted to refuse him, but I was too afraid to do so. It was too scary, and I had no choice but to listen to Guy's wish.

"Just to let you know, even if you have all the souls needed, you can't evolve if you don't meet the qualifications."

"No problem, both of them have fulfilled the conditions for awakening. So, please awaken them."

Guy described them, saying that they were too useless the way they were. Guy's criteria seemed to be somewhat strange. From what I had heard, Mizeri and Raine are 'primordials' like Testarossa and the others. Saying that they are useless, to say the least...

The more I thought about it, the more I felt uneasy being so close to a certain idiot who would actively agitate Guy. Oh well. All that remained was to see if there were enough souls.

"Only two people, Mizeri and Raine, need to be awakened, right?"

"Right. So, how many souls do you need?"

In the case of self-awakening, the number was 10,000, and in the case of evolving a subordinate through the 'soul lineage', it was 10x the amount---100,000. In this case, I had to consider that it would be even less efficient, since they were an unrelated third party. Now then, let's consider the number of necessary---

![break]

<<Answer. 500,000.>>

![break]

Five hundred thousand? 250,000 per person?! 25 times as many as usual, and even 2.5 times as many as those evolved through a soul corridor...

It was a lot, but if Wisdom King Raphael-san said so, it must be necessary.

"I think 500,000 souls would be enough."

"Oh? That's all you need? In that case, the amount I have stored up should be enough without killing any more humans."

*You have it?*

I mean, what were you going to do if you didn't have enough??

"Ah, really? W-well, that's good."

All I could do was laugh dryly. If it had come to that, I would have had to desperately try to stop Guy. I was glad that it did not happen, but I had mixed feelings when I thought of the number of victims so far. It was just a difference in values...

I prayed secretly that there would be no conflicts of interest in the future.

![soft scene break]

Benimaru and Shuna looked nervous as they listened to the exchange between Guy and me. I decided that there was no need to hide my conversation with Guy from them.

"That's how it is, so please go get our guests."

And by the way, there was Shion and Diablo. Guy was in a good mood and eating cake. This was his third piece of cake. He seemed to like it. As soon as he gave me the 500,000 souls, he acted as if his work was done. I already confirmed with Wisdom King Raphael-san that all the conditions were satisfied, but I wonder if it's because I was too narrow-minded to understand what's going on. As I was thinking about this, Shuna came back with Mizeri and Raine.

"It was a very nice cake, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama!"

"We are very happy to hear that you are willing to share your recipes with us!"

It was Mizeri's gushing praise and Raine's acknowledgment. It seems that the conversation was well communicated to Shuna, whom they were also polite to. If you can be so happy about such a thing, how about *not* playing a trivial game betting on the world? This world really is full of surprises. These two appeared to be perfect maids. They didn't seem to have the devastating palate of Shion, and they appeared to learn their craft very quickly. But first, they would have to go through the evolutionary rite of passage.

"The gratitude is received. I hope we can continue to cooperate with each other in the future."

Cooperation was the key. I hope they'd understand that one-sidedness was not good enough.

"You guys, Rimuru is going to give you power. You should be more grateful."

You should too. I swallowed the words and smiled at Mizeri and Raine.

"As a note on evolution, I think you will be lured into a sleep called the Harvest Festival. It will be hard to return in that state, so you can stay here for a few days."

Guy and his friends had come using Mizeri's 'portal' to the outside of the labyrinth. From there, with Ramiris' permission, they were invited into the labyrinth. It would be difficult to return to the labyrinth after the evolution ritual. I didn't think Guy would be kind enough to take them back to the labyrinth, so I would make sure to prepare a room for them. Besides---

"Are you sure?"

"Of course. So please send Guy and Velzard-san home first."

That was the idea. Now that the negotiations had been successfully completed, I would ask Guy to leave.

"Ahn? It can't be that much trouble. I'll take those two back, so don't mind them and give them some power."

*Eh?!*

Guy's unexpected reaction almost made me shout in surprise. It was not only me, but even Mizeri and Raine, who were the ones involved, who had a shocked expression on their faces. Their expressions told me that Guy was not going to do anything for them. It meant that Guy had his own agenda. Frankly, it was a pain in the ass. I didn't want Guy to see my power, and I wanted him to go home. I mean---at this point, something occurred to me.

I had been thinking that Guy and I have some similarities, but perhaps we really were alike. If it were me, I'd observe what he was doing and ask Wisdom King Raphael-san to see if I could reproduce it. Even if I couldn't reproduce it, I would need the information to plan countermeasures. From this perspective, there was a high possibility that Guy was planning to do the same thing. If so, I should avoid revealing my plan to Guy even more. Or, perhaps he has already found out?

![break]

<<Answer. No problem. As you ordered, only 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' is being revealed, so the rest is hidden.>>

![break]

That was truly great. As long as I leave it to Wisdom King Raphael-san, even Guy can be fooled. Although, even if that may be the case, I can be too careful. That's why I hope no more information will be leaked.

"No, no, no, you're welcome to stay. We have plenty of rooms available, so don't hesitate!"

This was non-negotiable. Guy's goal, no doubt, was to observe my abilities. He couldn't allow me to be the only one to see the cards in his hand. I had to get Guy out of here, no matter what...

Guy and I smiled at each other, engaging in an intense psychological battle beneath the surface. Just at that moment, the door to the room opened with a bang.

"I've been looking for you, Rimuru! The surveillance footage from the Control Room has disappeared, so I need you to bring it back up."

"That's right! There are people here cooperating with you to monitor the world!"

Veldora and Ramiris sounded like they were having fun. However, we were in the middle of a very important discussion, so hopefully they would read the atmosphere. Besides, that was a war strategizing room, not a playroom. Yes, it is still wartime, yet you guys just want to investigate where to play on the big screen.

...And I could go on and on. But right now I can't complain because I was the cause. I had said the other day that we'd have fun after the war. Since then, the two of them had been discussing where to go. The two have lived long lives, but surprisingly, they have never traveled around the world. Perhaps it was because they had a longing to travel, but they were even more enthusiastic about this than I was. And so, using my physical magic 'Argus', the two of them had made it a daily routine to enjoy the scenery of the world in their spare time.

The low-cost surveillance magic could be kept active all the time. Moreover, anyone could easily change their viewpoint. It was not possible to project an image from anywhere in the world, but it was possible to project a view over a reasonably large area. However, it was only natural that the magic effect would disappear if it was used too much.

"I'll be there later, so please wait quietly until then."

I would have to instruct them later not to make a fuss when guests were present. This was the responsibility of a parent or guardian. It was important to scold them for their future---not that I wanted to join them in checking things out. Anyway, let's leave it at that. I'm busy negotiating with Guy right now, so I'm going to have to kick Veldora out for now...

"Hey, isn't that Guy? What do you want with Rimuru?"

Ramiris recognized Guy. Then there was Veldora.

"Looks like you're having fun, Veldora-chan."

"Gaah?! Wha-wha---?! Why are you here, my sister...?!"

"I thought you would have grown up a little, but it seems you are still as noisy as ever. Even so, it is wonderful that you've learned how to take human form. And you also seem to be in good health for a person who has just been unsealed."

"O-oh, you look well too, I'm glad to hear that..."

The happy atmosphere had changed completely, and Veldora was tense. Velzard seemed to be kind, but Veldora appeared to feel differently.

"It's been a long time since we've seen each other, so I'd like to take the time to talk."

"N-no... I know you're very busy and I have work to do, so I don't have much free time..."

"Don't worry about it. Guy and Rimuru-sama's story is going to be a long one, so let's slowly take our time and talk."

Velzard-san emphasized the word 'slowly'. She was prepared to completely ignore the part where Veldora said he had some work to do. Veldora looked at me as if asking for help. So I, with a strong nod of my head, spoke up.

"Good luck."

"Rimuru-sama, may I borrow the room next door?"

Could I ever refuse Velzard-san's beautiful smile? No, I can't!

"Of course. I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about, so please take your time!"

That was all I could say. Farewell, Veldora. I will not forget your bravery! Veldora looked sad, knowing that he could no longer count on my help. But his hands moved quickly, grabbing Ramiris swiftly with a firm grip.

"H-Hey, wait, Master! I have nothing to do with this!"

"Please! Don't leave me alone!"

The sight of his pitiful appearance convinced me---Veldora and his sister must not get along well. Rather than not getting along, it seemed more like fear...

Speaking of having trouble getting along with sisters, the same was true of my friend from my previous life.

*'She's a tyrant...'* He used to complain like that with an enlightened look in his eyes.

I guess even a 'True Dragon' could have similarities to a human. Incidentally, he had been engaged in a fierce match over who was more unfortunate compared to those who were not fond of their younger siblings, but that's none of my business as I only had an older brother. I guess they were both on the same side. Veldora gave off the same feeling as them. This suddenly reminded me of something. I had been having a casual conversation with Veldora at that time. We were arguing about where to travel, and Veldora was stubbornly against the idea of going to the north.

He had made some excuse about how it was cold there, but I knew that was unnatural for someone who did not even feel the cold. Now I wondered if that was because he knew Velzard-san was there. As I looked at Veldora, who was gripping the door with a deathly look on his face and desperately begging not to go, I began to feel more and more sorry for him. Although I was planning to abandon him because I didn't want to get caught in the crossfire, I decided to help him a little. But if that didn't work, I would just give up and leave things be.

"Guy, you guys live further north than the Kingdom of Ingracia, don't you?"

"Hmm? Yeah, they call it the 'Frozen Continent' over here."

"There is no longer a habitat for living creatures there because I do not inhibit my mana. Since Guy dislikes the weak, I try to keep them away."

Not just Guy, but also Velzard, who stood up and put her hand on Veldora's shoulder, turned to me and answered.

*Good*, I thought to myself, and asked again.

"Is Velzard-san's power a cold-air type by any chance?"

"---I'm not sure if 'cold air' is accurate, but it might seem so if just by looking at the results."

I see, in that case, there is no doubt. It is surprising that Veldora, who is confident and fearless of the world, would have something he cannot cope with.

"Veldora is not very good at dealing with Velzard-san, is he?"

"D-don't be silly! There is nothing I am not good at!"

Don't try to be so tough. Not at a time like this. You'll only cause more damage.

"Isn't that right? After all, I've been taking good care of him."

Velzard spoke with an impeccable smile. She didn't have the slightest doubt that she was not good at what she did.

"When the newborn Veldora-chan was on a rampage, I quickly destroyed and regenerated him. When he was reborn and was still rampaging, I stopped his movements and made him quiet, then gave him a gentle sermon. He was a troubled child who couldn't be humanized, so the damage he caused was too much. If I had not cleaned up the mess, things would have gotten even more out of control."

Velzard spoke of many past deeds as if to say she had done a very good job. It was hard to listen to the story without tears. No doubt, this was because of that.

"Veldora, you've been through a lot..."

"Do you understand, Rimuru? Do you finally understand me?!"

That's right, no wonder he developed a sense of bitterness. It was just too bad that she didn't intend to be malicious. If this misunderstanding, or rather Velzard's assumption, was not cleared up, Veldora would be frightened for a very long time.

Also, Veldora was Veldora. It would be impossible for him to resist Velzard with his overweening bravado. If this pretense of strength did not stop, the relationship would not develop well. This kind of matter is a True Dragon type of relationship, right? Well, that doesn't matter.

"Velzard-san, at the risk of sounding like an interloper, I have to say that Veldora is not very fond of you."

"Oh, why?"

"In a phrase, it is because you're overdoing it. Instead of forcing him to listen to you, he should learn right and wrong on his own by you teaching him what he should do. Even Veldora understands what is right and wrong if we talk to him. So, please, can we stop using violence and just say what we mean?"

I offered Velzard-san to stay the night if she wanted. After a brief silence, Velzard-san sighed and nodded her head. Good. It seems that she has considered my proposal.

"R-Rimuru..."

"Good for you, Master! Now hurry up and let me go."

"I understand. Come to think of it, I have never heard Veldora-chan's thoughts. Let's take this opportunity to talk about it."

I guess they would still be talking slowly.

"O-okay, I understand. Please be merciful."

Veldora seemed to have regained his composure and was now contemplative. Hopefully, this would eliminate the rift between the two siblings...

This time Veldora did not resist and also went to the next room. However, Ramiris was still captured in his hand, which I would pretend I did not see.

"H-Hey, wait! I really have nothing to do with this!!"

I thought I heard such a voice, but as soon as the door to the room closed, I couldn't hear it anymore. Deciding that I had only imagined it, I turned to Guy who had remained.

![soft scene break]

After the noisy Veldora group left, the room suddenly became quiet.

"Well then..."

Guy muttered. I gulped and waited for his next words.

"Velzard seems to want to relax, so I guess I'll stay here today."

"Okay. I'll prepare a room for the three of you, so you don't have to worry."

"Ahn? Why are there three of us?"

"Uh, well, because you're going back home, aren't you?"

I asked him with the hope that he would go home. However, my expectations were betrayed.

"Don't be stupid. You and me, we're friends. I'll take care of you today."

So get going with Mizeri and Raine's evolution---his eyes spoke eloquently to me. Guy should really get what he deserves.

"No, no, I'd rather give you the best of hospitality next time. So for today---"

"You said earlier that you had extra rooms, right? I'm willing to put up with a little bit, so any room that's available is fine by me. I'd also like to try that tempura you were talking about."

I lost. Now that he's said all this, there's no way to say no. Rather than refusing and generating displeasure, it would be better to just expose one of the important secrets in my hand.

"Okay. Then I'll prepare the best room available. And as for dinner, I'll prepare tempura as you requested."

I nodded my head and looked at Shuna.

"Understood. Then, I will prepare it for you."

Shuna replied with a smile, bowed politely, and left the room. Haruna-san came in instead, and without saying a word, she remained in a corner of the room. Haruna-san was as airy and unobtrusive as a skilled maid herself. Mizeri and Raine also looked impressed, so it seemed safe to say that she was a first-class maid. Guy seemed to be very satisfied with his victory in the battle with me. At that moment, Diablo, who had been silent up until now, opened his mouth.

"Kufufufu, I see. So you are staying the night then, Guy?"

"Ahn? Yes, but..."

"I see. Well then, I guess we have plenty of time."

"You, what are you talking about...?"

"No, it's nothing, I just thought it would be just right."

"Just right? What do you mean?"

"I have many follow-ups to our earlier discussion I'd like to talk about, and I know that you have also boasted about your Ultimate Skill since a long time ago. So today, I'd like to ask you about it in detail."

*Ooooh!!!*

Nice work, Diablo. The tables have turned and Guy is now on the ropes. I couldn't let this chance pass me by.

"In that case, Diablo, show Guy to the inner parlor. You two can spend the rest of the day talking!"

"Thank you very much, Rimuru-sama. I can only express my gratitude for your kindness."

Diablo placed a hand on Guy's shoulder while saying so.

"Uh, wait, wait!!"

"No more waiting, let's go."

Guy was surprisingly weak when he was attacked this way. He was then taken away in a flash by Diablo, who did not give any indication towards his presence or absence. Diablo really came in handy in unexpected places. Now that Guy was gone, I could use my power with peace of mind. I didn't know when he'd be back, so I would have to finish the ritual quickly. I immediately poured the souls into Mizeri and Raine, prompting them to evolve.

![break]

<<Notice. The number of souls required, 100,000, has been achieved. The evolution of individual Mizeri has started.>>

![break]

Hmm? That's strange. I had received 500,000 souls from Guy.

![break]

<<Notice. Evolution of individual Raine has started... Success.>>

![break]

The total number of souls used was 200,000. Huh? Does that mean I can evolve them even if they don't have a soul connection as long as they are qualified?

...Hey! There were more questions before getting to that. Did you, with 300,000 left over, mean---

![break]

<<Answer. Due to mastering the procedure, less souls than expected were required.>>

![break]

Yeah, well, it's definitely not like that, is it? There's no way you can use that excuse when you've gotten so many souls!

![break]

<<Answer. Including the requirements for individuals: Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera, it is necessary.>>

![break]

What have you done?! You're so reckless, Wisdom King Raphael-san. Fearless. It actually played a trick on Demon Lord Guy Crimson! No, wait! That means I'm the one who's gonna bear the grudge if he finds out about this!

![break]

<<Answer. No problem.>>

![break]

No, it's full of problems. Now I'm thinking you're a little too scary. This is why I'm afraid of the fearless.

![break]

<<No. It is just that the level of skill in handling the 'information particles' was higher than expected. The excess is considered to be a reward.>>

![break]

No, is that okay? It's a bit of a stretch, but...

This is scarier than committing fraud against the yakuza. If he finds out, I wouldn't even be able to complain before being wiped out. Although I didn't show it on my face, I couldn't stop sweating and trembling on the inside. It's been a long time since I've been so thankful for being a slime.

![break]

That night we had a banquet. Guy, though seemingly disgruntled, never complained to me. On the contrary, he even thanked me.

"I have a lot to say, but I'm already tired today. The evolution seems to have succeeded, so I would like to thank you for that."

He looked really, really tired. I wonder why? In contrast to Guy, Diablo appeared very lively. How strange.

"No, no, you're welcome."

It was wiser not to get involved. I pretended not to notice anything and left the subject unaddressed. He seemed satisfied with the food, and the hot spring also appeared to have put them in a good mood. Velzard was also in good spirits after talking with Veldora.

"I will come back."

"I'll do my best to entertain you then."

"I'm looking forward to it. It is cold in our country, so the hot springs are very soothing!"

"I'm glad you liked it. I look forward to seeing you again."

"Oh, you're a good talker. I hope to see you and Veldora-chan again, and next time, I'll make sure to take my time visiting you."

The aforementioned Veldora, however, was nowhere to be seen. It seemed that he had fought briefly with Velzard in the labyrinth and was now wounded all over, unable to move.

"Kuhaha, kuahahahaha! Tell her that I took it easy on her this time, and I won't show mercy the next time."

"Are you sure you want me to tell her that?"

"...I'm sorry."

He made some excuse with a very quiet voice, but I was kind enough to ignore it. Then again, Velzard-san didn't seem to have fought seriously, so I guess he would recover in a few days from that kind of injury. On the other hand, it was the first time for me seeing Veldora injured, and I was reminded of the strength of the existence of 'True Dragons'. The Empire also had another sister of Veldora. In order to think of a proper countermeasure, I decided I would ask Wisdom King Raphael-san to show me information on the battles between the True Dragons later on.

![soft scene break]

Guy and his colleagues left behind useful information and set off home. We would resume our discussion on the future plans, referring to the information. I was so enthusiastic, and then someone came to me in a hurry. It was Myourmiles.

"Oh, Rimuru-sama! There you are. I've been looking for you."

"What's the matter, why are you in such a hurry?"

"I can be in a hurry if necessary. My elder sister is here. She wants me to call Rimuru-sama."

"Big sis?"

I was surprised and rushed out to meet them. The destination was a certain ryokan in a prime location. It was always there that big sis would come. 'Big sis' was a code word, understood only between me and Myourmiles. That's right, it was only because calling that person directly by name would create some problems that we called her 'sister'. That person, of course, was Elmesia El-Ru Sarion, the emperor of the Sorcerer's Dynasty of Sarion. Another alias for her was 'El' from our 'conspiracy trio'.

I was Rimu. Myourmiles-kun was Gar. Elmesia-san was El. In terms of hierarchy, El was the top and I was the second. Gar was the third, and we were all excitedly involved in certain matters. Since it was El who summoned me, there was no choice but to rush over. However, she should have known that it was wartime...

"We are in the middle of a war right now."

"Of course I told her. She even mentioned that the next time she would come back would be after things settled down."

In fact, Myourmiles-kun spent much more time with Elmesia-san than me. He had been negotiating with Elmesia-san on my behalf because of my busy schedule. This was both the front and back side. By 'front', I meant the official diplomatic relations with the Sorcerer's Dynasty of Sarion. I myself had nothing to do with it and left everything to Myourmiles-kun and Rigurd. The progress of construction and logistics arrangements, arrangement of tariffs and other rights, as well as security of each other's merchants and visitors were all examined. The process was repeated over and over again until arriving at mutually acceptable terms. They worked hard and without complaint through such a tedious process of negotiation. On the other hand, the other side of our relationship (the 'back') had to do with our darker deeds, in which we, the conspiracy trio, were in our element. It may sound less than savory, but the contents were indeed true. Just what were our darker deeds? It was our plan to take control of the newly born giant economic circle.

.........

......

...

At first, the three of us had just been drinking buddies. But then we soon began to discuss business matters, and before we knew it, we were even discussing important matters of national management. It had been my fault for being so loose with my words, but Myourmiles-kun was just as guilty for not stopping us. Besides, we were not the only ones at fault, Elmesia-san also revealed a lot of secrets to us. We couldn't afford to let our guards down. The three of us blamed it all on the alcohol.

This relationship was, of course, top secret. A secret between the three of us. Absolutely.

If anybody found out that we had been talking like this, they would be very angry with us. I would be silently pressured by everyone, and Myourmiles-kun would probably be blamed to the point of stomach perforation. Elmesia-san would no doubt get some sarcasm from Elalude and the others as well. And so, the three of us were powerfully united. As a conspiracy trio, we had formed a friendship that transcended our positions.

![break]

Our relationship began in earnest when we won the battle against the Rosso family. At the time when the Rosso family was in decline, the underground organizations behind the Western Nations were in a state of collapse. With no one to coordinate them, they began to appear as a rivalry of rivalries. I had ordered Testarossa to maintain security, so there was not too much confusion, but it was not a situation that could be left unattended. Only when the police---or rather, the military---of each country was unable to handle the situation were they allowed to help secretly.

The problem was how to deal with the criminals. The reason why the military of each country could not handle them was because of the retaliation from the criminal organizations. In some cases, the local lords were even the head of the criminal organizations, and they were hesitant to reveal their crimes to the public. Of course, the crimes could not be allowed to go unchecked, but if they were pursued, civil war might break out. For fear of such a situation, the state could not interfere. There were many situations in which the state had no choice but to tolerate the crimes. I was troubled by this situation and complained to Elmesia-san, who frequently stayed at the hotel.

"I wish you would consult me on something more pleasant."

At first, Elmesia-san was reluctant to give me a detailed explanation, but as she listened to my words, her eyes gradually changed and she leaned forward to give me a detailed explanation. What I had stated, in other words, was beneficial not only to me but also to Elmesia-san. Or rather, I had been telling her such dream-like things, trying to get her interested in it. Economy and crime were inextricably linked. The gap between the rich and the poor, the widening of the gap would cause envy, and it may even affect the reign of the government. Criminal organizations would be fattened up as a receptacle for the poor, and this may be a cause of disturbance of the nation.

Myourmiles-kun used to be a don of such an underworld. He understood what I was explaining to him. The important thing was to prepare a place for the poor. It was important to provide a job that anyone could do, so that no matter how many people dropped out, they would not have to commit crimes. That was usually the military. There were a wide range of jobs in the military, and they were always looking for people to do them, but if the nation was poor, they were not able to do them. And so, we were going to support them from the shadows.

"First, we create a criminal organization. We have already laid the groundwork by absorbing the organizations we have destroyed in various countries. We can round up all the organizations that are currently kept at bay."

I had spoken in a drunken stupor, but this had succeeded in attracting Elmesia-san's interest.

"I see. There is no organization in Western Nations that can compete with the secret society Cerberus. I guess many of them would be loyal to the organization if they were given food, clothing, and shelter."

To Elmesia-san, who had been reluctant to join the meeting so far, the next statement was the decisive factor.

"Right? In this way, now that the poor are taken care of, the next step would be to deal with the rich."

"Oh...?"

"Now that Granbell is gone, there is no doubt that the Rosso family will be in decline. The organization that is strong now will be weakened in time. My project is going to take its place."

"A project? Let's hear it."

"That's it. As previously mentioned, the Kingdom of Blumund could function as an industrial agglomeration. Fuze-dono is also making preparations and has already secured the necessary manpower."

Myourmiles was also consulted about this great idea. It was important to coordinate interests with neighboring countries in order to achieve co-existence and co-prosperity. The Dwarven Kingdom's industry, the Kingdom of Farmenas' agriculture, and the Sarion Dynasty's industry. These industries would flow into the Kingdom of Blumund, although they'd need to be coordinated so that they would not compete with each other. And then, through this window, they would spread to the Western Nations.

"Oh, Elalude-chan reported that. Are you really going to implement that plan?"

"Of course, right?"

"So, where are you looking for the benefit, Rimu-chi?"

"The profits are secondary."

"Hm...?"

"I'm kidding! We are what we are. We've got the core technology, and we're going to release it. For example, to build a large university campus city and attract the best students from all over the world. We're going to make tourism a pillar of our country, but secretly sneak around behind the scenes!"

"Wahahahaha! Patents, the patents! A dream system that brings in money even if you don't work! I understand the concept itself, but it will be difficult to make it known."

"I see. So you develop products that cannot be made without using the technology, and secure intellectual property rights!"

"El-tan, you are very perceptive! I appreciate your quick response, but don't copy me, okay?"

"First come, first served, right? And no! Rather than copying you, let me have a piece of the action."

"Wahahahaha! If you cooperate with us, this project is as good as a success!"

"Oh my, Gar-chan. That's true, but don't praise me too much!"

The drinking party was a lot of fun. And then came the next day. The three of us looked at one another, regretting that we had said too much.

"Well, about yesterday..."

"Yes, I remember. Well, you blurted out some things you shouldn't have said, right?"

"Yeah..."

"Please, please, please keep this a secret. I can't have this project going down the drain here..."

"Don't worry about that now, Gar-chan. I'll keep my promise, even if it was made in a drunken stupor."

And just like that, we were united by a failure of a drinking session.

![break]

From there we began pushing the project forward. With two heads of superpowers in the same room, things moved along swiftly. The domination of the West proceeded under the radar at a pace that would be surprising to anyone else. In just a few months, the unification of criminal organizations was completed. Thus, a brand-new secret society was born, one we called REG^[It is a Japanese acronym, 'Riega' in Japanese, so the 'Ri' from Rimuru, the 'E' from Elmesia, and the 'Ga' from Gard (Myourmiles) combine to create the 'Riega' or just REG, since English has letters and not just whole syllables to work with. A funny play on words.]---the Three Drunk Sages was born.

The members of the society were puzzled about the origin of the name 'Three Drunk Sages', but that was not our concern. That was off topic, so we would leave it at that. The main issue was the progress of the project. The poor who had been oppressed in various countries had been taken in by the mysterious secret society 'Three Drunk Sages', which was an emerging force. After a month or so of aptitude tests, the right people for the job were selected. If they were judged to be particularly talented, they were invited to our country for formal study.

Glenda Atlee was the one who was imposed with such a troublesome task. She used to be one of the 'Three Martial Sages' and now worked for Souei. She had been playing the role of a pushy boss, as she had said that she would do anything, even the dirty work. As for Glenda's subordinates, there was Girard, the leader of the mercenary group 'Apostles of Verte', and Ayn, a spirit wielder who was his subordinate. These two were also active in the Western Nations, and they were good at uniting the ruffians. They were well known in the underground world and supported Glenda.

Everyone seemed to think that 'Three Drunk Sages' referred to these three people. The truth is that it was honestly referring to three drunkards, but since this was misinterpreted as one with 'drunken dreams' or something cool like that, I would let the truth stay buried in my heart. That was the underworld.

Next, there were the organizations that were active on the surface. If we left things to one organization, a breeding ground for corruption would inevitably fester. To avoid this, it was better to have opposing organizations side by side. Because of this, we decided to prepare two organizations.

The first one was a new organization that Myourmiles-kun was in charge of. It was based on the employees trained in the Kingdom of Blumund, and was engaged in commercial activities in cooperation with the council. Its official name was the 'Four Nations Trade Federation'. With Tempest as the head, the Kingdom of Blumund, the Kingdom of Farmenas, and the Dwarven Kingdom were all members of this organization. Because the representative was Myourmiles-kun, it was known that I was involved.

The second was the Western Nations' Federation Chamber of Commerce, which Elmesia-san was working for behind the scenes. With the financing of King Dolan and his kingdom carrying the banner, the surviving members of the Rosso family had been absorbed. Because we mainly concentrated on those with strong hostility towards us, a larger force than expected had been born. This organization was officially called the 'Western General Trading Company'. The representative was one of the sons of King Dolan who seemed to be an excellent man who had inherited the Rosso blood. Only King Dolan and his son, Prince Figaro Ross Dolan, knew about Elmesia-san's involvement. They agreed to our plan on the condition that they would be protected by Elmesia-san.

*'In the Rosso family, we must be flexible in our thinking to survive. If the demon lord, who will be the supreme ruler of this world, and the emperor, who will have a great influence on the world, have joined forces, the decision not to give in will only mean destruction.'*

This was apparently King Dolan's first words when he was told of the plan. The Rosso family was a family that valued contracts. It was believed that this relationship would be maintained as long as both parties fulfilled their covenants. Incidentally, Elmesia-san and my shares together added up to 61 percent of the Western General Trading Company. Since Elmesia-san was the largest shareholder, the moment Figaro betrayed me, it would mean the collapse of the entire trading company. Elmesia-san told me that she did not think Figaro, who was a good man, would make such a foolish choice. I agreed with her opinion, so I decided to trust Figaro and let him be the representative director for the time being.

![break]

In this way, the two organizations began their activities at the same time. On the surface, these two organizations were hostile adversaries. They competed with each other for prices and distribution, but it was a healthy competition under the law, without the need of force or intervention. Some cowardly people tried to take advantage of the underworld, but they somehow ended up in a lot of pain. A report from the 'Three Drunk Sages' mentioned that something strange was going on. I didn't dare to stop them, but I hoped they would understand that overdoing things could bring misfortune.

As sad as it is that some people used excessive tactics, both parties seemed to be motivated enough to do so. Both were growing faster than I had expected. In just a few months, the organizational structure seemed to have stabilized. Each side had been subdivided into positions, and the ranks had been established. Even now, when we were being attacked by the Empire, I heard that they were prospering from the special war demands. It was a bit much to be so business-minded, but the profits would be returned to me, so I should consider it as a necessary evil. I didn't think it was right to say that everything should be regulated. Well, in this case, I had my own interests, so I thought so even more. And so, control of the economic circle was getting closer and closer to completion.

.........

......

...

The fact that Elmesia-san had come first unscheduled undoubtedly meant that there had been an emergency. If I had to guess, I would say that Prince Figaro had betrayed us. I had already devised a countermeasure in that case, but I would have to contribute my share to the fund. No wonder Elmesia-san came to see me.

![soft scene break]

Upon arriving at the hotel, I was escorted to a separate room where Elmesia-san was waiting for us.

"Sorry to keep you waiting. What's up today, El?"

In any case, no speculation was necessary. I decided to hear what she had to say. Elmesia-san was in a bad mood. She looked at me with a glare, not even trying to hide the fact that she was upset.

"H-Huh? What is it? Are you in a bad mood?"

"Of course! You---do you even understand what you've done?"

Whoa, whoa! She seems to be very serious, doesn't she? And apparently, it doesn't seem to be related to the 'Three Drunk Sages'...

"W-what does that mean?"

"Sit down."

"Uh, yes."

It was not a good idea to offend Elmesia-san who had a very sharp glare, so I sat down on the tatami. Myourmiles-kun was also sitting on the tatami next to me. Unlike me, he seemed to be in a lot of pain.

"Rimu-chi, is it true that you have evolved some of your subordinates?"

*Why does she know about that?!*

I glanced at Myourmiles-kun with a sideways glance and tried to get an answer from him, but he gestured that he did not know by frantically shaking his head. In that case, where did this leak come from?

"I received an urgent message from my boy Gazel. He debated whether to tell me or not, but in the end, he decided this should be communicated. He's very disciplined, that boy."

From Elmesia-san's point of view, even that old man Gazel was treated like a child. But I didn't know about that. I guess it was not surprising that he did not hide it from her, but the speed of information transmission was unexpected.

"The Eastern Empire was looking worse than I thought, so I wanted to reinforce everyone. Then, I thought it would be worse to hide it, so I invited Jaine-san too."

"I see, so it's true..."

Elmesia-san stood up, turned her back to me, and looked out the window. Her back seemed melancholy, and she seemed sad for some reason.

"---Why are you nodding your head as if this is none of your business?"

With a snap, Elmesia-san hit my head with her fan that she pulled out.

"N-no, no, I didn't mean..."

I just wanted to lighten the heavy atmosphere.

"What are you trying to do with such a large force?"

"Well, it's not anything, really. Just trying to build a country where people can live happily."

"My boy Gazel told me that you have another 'primordial' in your crew besides Diablo, is that right?"

"Oh, I didn't tell you? I was also surprised when I found out recently. You know Testarossa, don't you? I had thought she was very strong, but it turned out that she was one of the 'primordials'. And there are two more---Carrera and Ultima, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the Attorney General of our country."

As I was explaining this, Elmesia-san began to tremble.

"So that is also true..."

After muttering like this, Elmesia-san sat upright in front of me and stared straight at me. Then she bluntly asked me a question.

"Are you trying to destroy the world?"

"N-no way."

"That's the only way people on the outside can see it!"

She yelled at me. I started making excuses in a panic. Myourmiles-kun joined me in support and then we exchanged words for about 30 minutes.

"You mean Guy and Rudra are playing a game with each other's pawns to decide the winner?"

"That's right!"

"Is that right, Gar?"

"Well, I didn't know the details of the situation. But in any case, this isn't really something I should know about."

"It shouldn't be, but it can't be helped, right?"

"It is difficult for me to be satisfied with just *'it can't be helped'*..."

I know, right? I totally got you into this. Honestly, I'm sorry, okay? But I'm sure that because Myourmiles-kun and I are good friends he'll forgive me.

"Hah, well now I know what happened. You can't say no to Guy if he threatens you..."

Yeah, that's it! I was threatened by Guy---let's call it what it is.

"Right? That's why it's been hard for me too."

Myourmiles-kun's tone had shifted, but I think I can cover it up now. Elmesia-san let out a sigh. She seems to have recovered her composure, perhaps because her anger has been lifted.

"So, what are you going to do?"

"W-what do you mean?"

"You're not someone who will just play as Guy's pawn, are you?"

"No, I'm going to be nice."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, I thought about it, but..."

Elmesia-san didn't understand what I was thinking so I told her frankly. There would certainly be powerful men of unknown strength waiting for us in the Empire. Avoiding a battle at this point was one way, but I thought it would only postpone the problem. I would have to live constantly alert for a long time, wary of assassins from the Empire. There would be skirmishes with assassins, and even if I was careful, there would be casualties. In order to avoid such a situation, I wanted to take the initiative. To begin with, the war for the Empire was a ritual to create awakened beings. If so, we would have to keep on fighting with them. Ignoring them would only give them more time.

"That's my decision. I'm going to go in with just my main force to negotiate for peace because there's no point in having the numbers. If we can deal with Rudra's pawns there, Guy will take care of the rest."

The truth is that I don't trust Guy, and I didn't expect that much from him. The problem was who to take with me.

"Rimuru-sama, are you going to be okay?"

"Myourmiles-kun...who do you think I am? I may look like this, but I'm still a part of the Octagram. Emperor of the Empire or his imperial guard, they won't be a match!"

"That's right! As expected of a goddess..."

"Hmm? Goddess?"

He...he still sees me that way? He caught me staring at him and reiterated in a panicked manner.

"It's not---you're a reliable demon lord, Your Majesty!"

"O-oh. Well, you can count on me then! Hahaha!"

"Wahahaha!"

We laughed out loud. As nice as that sounded, I was planning to run away and come back if things got bad. I was prepared to shut myself in at that time, so it was useless to think about things too hard.

"Ho...can you tell me about whether you will eliminate Emperor Rudra's men or murder his own lord or father?"

I didn't like it when people asked questions on the assumption that I was going to win, but I had already decided on this.

"I'm trying not to kill. Judging from the game's win condition, Guy wins when all but Rudra are neutralized. From that point on, it's not my problem to interfere with."

Elmesia-san nodded her head in satisfaction.

"Okay, I understand. Do your best not to disappoint us. In the case of an emergency, I will take care of your country too."

Stop! Don't say such ominous things!

"Don't worry! I hate self-sacrifice! My motto is to live happily together, and I have no intention of dying!"

Elmesia-san laughed happily when she heard my reply.

"That's good. Take heart and remember that if you die, this world is doomed. There is no other monster who could tame Diablo and the other primordials. The demon lords you've created may not all agree with you. If conflicts arise, wars will inevitably break out. Do you understand? Don't give up on anything that you plan to do. Don't ever forget it."

It was Elmesia-san's heartfelt advice.

"I know. I really do."

That is why I also swore to do so with a serious expression on my face.

The battle was in the endgame. A few more moves and we would win. But at this point, one wrong move could turn everything around. We had to be calm and careful. First, I needed to contact Yuuki and discuss how to deal with Emperor Rudra. And so, the next day came. We embarked on a journey to the Empire.
