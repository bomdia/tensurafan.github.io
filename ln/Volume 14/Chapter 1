# Chapter 1: Rewards and|Evolutions

It was the day after the revival of almost 700,000 imperial soldiers. At the Colosseum, the men who had played an active role in the defense were all lined up. The bleachers were filled with the last of the soldiers. Today was a victory party. Although the war against the Empire was still ongoing, it was planned as a necessary morale booster. Bacchus, who had been sent by the Holy Knight Order, and the 'Surmounters' under Luminas were also present. They were killed by Jiwu, but fortunately they had been in the labyrinth. They were revived and the apologies were accepted. Although they were unanimous in saying that it was only due to inexperience, it still happened in our country, and formality is important.

In any case, I was glad that the damage was minimal. We were planning to serve delicious food in the latter half of the party, so I hoped people would enjoy it to their heart's content. In the guest of honor's seats, there were guests from foreign countries. Not only Alvis who participated in the defense as a reinforcement, but also Phobio and the two members of the 'Two Wings' arrived later with the elite contingent.

"Milim-sama was worried and restless, so Frey-sama sent us."

"But, as I said, it was not necessary. We were sure that Rimuru-sama would be the definitive winner."

Lucia with blonde hair and Claire with silver hair spoke to me in overlapping beautiful voices. I feel like I made Milim worried, but I'm sure she will be relieved when I tell her about this victory. The town is safe thanks to Veldora and Ramiris, and we should be able to return to our normal lives soon.

"I am the liaison. I was sent here just in case the Magic Communication had gone down. And---no, I'm sorry, I'm being rude."

Phobio said he was planning to come back immediately to send reinforcements in case we were defeated. Considering the possibility that the magicules' force field would be disturbed and magic could not be used, Phobio, who was the fastest, was selected. He was about to say something after that, but stopped halfway. I was concerned about the way he looked at Alvis, but I decided to ignore it, assuming that he had already finished his business. I thanked the three of them and showed them to the distinguished guests' table.

Then, there was another group. There was also a guest of honor from Dwargon. There was Jaine, an old lady who was the top archwizard in Dwargon. Commander of the Pegasus Knights, Dolph-san was also there as a guard. This one was mainly here to complain.

'Don't use the forbidden spells in the Great Jura Forest,' she said.

More than that, she was furious with me, her eyes changing as she asked me why I had a 'primordial' with me. To be honest, I feel sorry about that too. But it can't be helped. I was already there before I could realize it, and it was an irresistible force majeure.

"It is not a matter of force majeure! I've never been so surprised and astonished in all the years I've lived!"

"I'm sorry."

All I could do was apologize. Anyway, I tried to quiet her down, explained things to her and got her in a good mood, and somehow or other, she agreed. I really wanted Jaine-san to go home, but we had to have a meeting in the future. Actually, that was the purpose of this visit.

In front of the eastern city of Dwargon, 60,000 troops under Yuuki's command were still deployed. Since they have been told that we are in a tentative alliance with Yuuki, war has not broken out and tensions have remained high. However, we can't just leave things as they are. I wanted to discuss with Yuuki about the future plan. I had released the captured Laplace and entrusted him with a message from me. Now we were waiting for Yuuki to contact us. So, Jaine-san and Dolph-san were also invited to the guest of honor's table. They were invited to observe the victory celebration.

![break]

Well, the victory celebration began with foreign guests watching the event. I was on the podium, which was one step higher than the others. I was sitting on a chair there, in my slime form. Behind me, Rigurd and Rigur stood side by side. With these two men at the top, the civil servants stood on either side of me.

![full page image](image1)

Among those lined up below us were the Dungeon's Elite Ten, whose faces were not usually seen. It was only natural, since they were the stars of the day. Normally, they were the bosses of the labyrinth, so it was not good for them to show their faces. But not today. It was because the townspeople and the adventurers who made up the volunteer soldiers were not invited.

First to appear was Shuna, standing beside me. She prefaced her speech with my words and then gave her speech of consolation to the crowd. It was a great speech, but I actually didn't come up with it. It was all Shuna. Shuna is a better secretary than the first secretary or the second secretary. As I am not good at giving speeches, she is very helpful to me.

Shion is not good at giving speeches, and the thought of Diablo doing it is unsettling---the praises he'd give for me alone would last until the celebration was already over. Grateful to Shuna for being here, I began to think about the next steps. In this victory celebration, I was going to reward the others as well as announce their achievements. In other words, I was going to test the awakening of my subordinates.

.........

......

...

According to Wisdom King Raphael-san, by giving my subordinates 100,000 souls, they will be awakened and evolve to be as strong as a 'True Demon Lord'. Only those who qualify are eligible, but surprisingly there were twelve of them. They were Ranga, Benimaru, Shion, Gabil, Geld, Diablo, Testarossa, Ultima, Carrera, Kumara, Zegion, and Adalmann. It seems that they needed to have a soul connection with me and also possess the 'Demon Lord Seed'. Adalmann was the one I was interested in. In his case, I did not name him, so why did he qualify for evolution?

![break]

<<Answer. Individual Adalmann's faith has broken through a certain threshold and now the connection with the Master is established!>>

![break]

Oh, I taught Adalmann the 'secrets of faith and grace' that I had learned from Luminas. Thanks to that, he got a connection as good as a given name. That's great, Adalmann. He seems to have a lot of faith in himself to get the qualification by himself. It's a little bit awkward for me to be the target of that faith, but I admire him for that. Adalmann's case made sense to me.

The next question is, how many people can I evolve? I counted and found that the number of souls I had in my stock was about a little more than a million. The secret of this is that I have Wisdom King Raphael-san.

![break]

<<Proposal. Individual differences were confirmed in the souls obtained. Do you want to reconstitute uniformly?

YES/NO>>

![break]

When asked to answer, I said 'YES' without even understanding what it meant. Then, the number of souls swelled up to more than a million. I had returned a number of energies back to the Imperial officers who were brought back to life. Therefore, I thought that the number would be a little smaller, but the result was the opposite. There were a large number of awakened people like Calgurio, and a large number of powerful people who had attacked the labyrinth. They had more energy than usual, and they took a lot of energy from Jiwu and Bernie who had the Ultimate Skill, even if it was borrowed. It may be that each individual had the soul energy of dozens to tens of thousands of people. For this reason, ten people could be awakened.

However, there were some concerns in trying this out. The first was the leakage of information. Was it safe to do such a showy act in front of guests such as Alvis and Jaine? However, I decided to trust them on this issue. Not because of our alliance, but because I thought they would find out anyway. It is impossible to fool Milim, and King Gazel trusted me during that time with Diablo. Even if Jaine-san was very angry with me, this was nothing now that everything with the labyrinth was known. In time, there would be unnatural rumors about the strength of the bosses from the labyrinth group. Those present thought that there was no point in keeping it a secret.

The second concern was that I was not exactly sure what was going to happen. Since this was the first time for me to attempt the evolution of awakening, there was a possibility that something unexpected would happen. Therefore, I had the entire Colosseum isolated by Ramiris' ability. This would prevent the damage from spreading to the outside. Besides, it would also maintain confidentiality, so it was a two birds with one stone solution.

The last concern was the evolutionary Harvest Festival that would occur like when I awakened as a demon lord. In my case, I fell into a low-level active state (sleep mode) and was unconscious for three days. In a similar situation, the main executives of our group would fall asleep during this time of war. I was worried that something might happen to them, since they would not be able to do anything for two or three days.

Although I was a little worried about this, I thought it would not be a problem either. There was no Imperial Army now. Calgurio and the others had told me that there was no immediate strength left in the Armored Corps. Of course, there couldn't be any left since we had killed all 940,000 of their generals. Only the Magic Beast Corps and Mixed Corps remained on the Imperial side.

The Mixed Corps led by Yuuki was in an alliance of sorts, and the Magic Beast Corps was being carried by the 'Air Assault Division', the tiger cubs of the Armored Corps, and was heading off in a different direction. Since my 'Argus' is able to track the movement of the airship, I calculated that it would take more than three days for them to reach my country even if it suddenly changed its direction of movement from that point.

The normal speed of the Argus was about 400 kilometers per hour on average. It is said that the maximum combat speed would exceed the speed of sound, but mana depletion would be too great and it would last only for a short time. In the first place, it is doubtful if it is even possible to fly such a long distance continuously. The speeds of ships and trains are incomparable, but the sky has its own threats. There are points where air currents swirl violently, points where magicule is disrupted and magic cannot be used at all, and so on.

It is said that there are also zones where troublesome sky monsters dwell, and it is necessary to think of safe air routes instead of straight ones. In this world, just having a means to travel at the speed of sound is a threat, but it is not as advantageous as one might think. It seemed to me that there was no need for us to be alarmed. The only thing that remained was the possibility of the Imperial Guardians making a move...

This time, we had won hands down, but only because we had the advantage of the labyrinth. I was able to deal with the situation calmly because I could come back to life even if I died. I would have been able to handle those near guard knights. Regardless, Benimaru would have been able to win. But what about Shion and Ranga? Gabil and Geld might have been in danger too.

If so, we should be able to deal with them as soon as possible. Even if we unexpectedly encounter a strong enemy, we should be able to at least buy time. The connection between our souls will be established as 'Soul Corridor', and it seems that the connection with me will be rock solid as well. With this, the 'Telepathy Net' will be connected in any situation. They will be able to contact me as soon as they encounter an enemy, and then we will be able to flank each other and take the enemy out.

I wanted to awaken everyone now in case of an emergency. I wanted to be prepared for anything. All in all, now was the right time to do so.

.........

......

...

So let's get started right away. The first person I wanted to nominate was, of course, Benimaru. As the Army General, he had done an excellent job in commanding the entire army. He seemed to be dissatisfied with Testarossa and the demon girls' performance, but yes, it was a kind of accident. It was not Benimaru's fault, nor mine! In the end, it was all right, and I can say that it was a great job done.

Shuna finished her speech and called up Benimaru. In response, Benimaru stepped forward. Then he knelt down in front of me.

"All right! Well, Benimaru-kun, I'm going to reward you right now."

"Can you stop with the '-kun'? You're definitely---you're up to something again, aren't you?"

I don't understand. I haven't even done anything yet, and he's seeing right through me. This awakening evolution was actually supposed to be a surprise. I thought that if I told him about it, he would definitely oppose it, so I decided to do it without telling him. Shuna was reading out Benimaru's achievements. Meanwhile, the conversation between Benimaru and me was still going on.

"Actually, I got a lot of souls in this war. It seems that Testarossa and the others were offering their souls to me. And, if I use it, I can awaken those who are connected to me."

"Why haven't I heard about that?"

"Eh? Because I'm just saying it now?"

Benimaru and I were staring at each other, wide-eyed. It's because I think he would have objected if I had told him. Benimaru is more serious than I thought, and he seems to want to be strong only by himself. When I evolved into a demon lord, he seemed to have some thoughts about it. I think Diablo and Shion would have been happy to accept this.

"So, what do you mean by awakening?"

That's a good question. In my case, my magicules and mana increased more than tenfold, and all the monsters in the soul lineage have been given a gift. I didn't know what his growth rate would be, but I was sure it would be a big increase in power.

"Let's see, to put it simply, I evolved when I became a demon lord, didn't I? You can think of it as the same phenomenon, the Harvest Festival to become a demon lord."

"Huh? Does that mean that not only me, but also my subordinates will be affected?"

"I think maybe they will."

It was unclear to what extent this would affect the Kurenai, but at the very least, gifts would be distributed to them.

"No, no, no...this is so important, but you just said it out of the blue without any consultation---"

"Wait, wait, hold on. That may be so, but this is not the time for questions and answers. Now that we don't know how strong the enemy is, it's imperative that we strengthen our forces, isn't it?"

"I'm sure that's true, but..."

Benimaru closed his eyes in distress. Then he opened his eyes, looked at me, and sighed deeply. He appeared to have made up his mind. Or maybe he just gave up, but it didn't make much difference.

"So, I'm not the only one you're awakening, am I? I think it's dangerous to lose so much battle strength at this time."

"Only twelve are qualified to awaken, and currently only nine can be awakened. I am going to leave Testarossa and the others as escorts, I have decided that a few days will not be a problem."

"I see. We have the labyrinth, so I guess it's not a problem if we just need to stall for time."

Benimaru agreed with my explanation. The remaining question was about the possibility of someone going out of control.

"However, there is one point of concern."

"What's that?"

"You are stronger now than you were when I evolved. The rate of growth from awakening is unknown, so you could become stronger than I am."

In that case, the 'Food Chain' of the Ultimate Skill 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' might give me some feedback. Still, there was a possibility that he would become stronger than I am. I mean, Diablo and the others were definitely going to be stronger than me. I don't think Benimaru and the others will betray me, but I can't deny the possibility that they will be swayed by their power and go out of control. I think they will probably be fine, and the Isolation space was designed for in case they run out of control, but it was true that I had such a concern.

"Do you really want to force our awakening, even with such concerns?"

"Well, yeah."

"We are loved. We must do everything we can to defeat any adversary, right? In that case, I will certainly meet your expectations."

I didn't even need to say anything for Benimaru to understand my thoughts. He even assured me that he would never go out of control. He's truly reliable.

"I believe you."

"Leave it to me."

Just then, Shuna's speech was over. So, I awarded him right away.

![soft scene break]

"Benimaru! Your command in this battle was truly outstanding! From this day forward, you can call yourself the 'Flare Lord'!"

"Yes, thank you!"

The ritual began. He was usually friendly, but in front of the soldiers, he was the army commander. Benimaru was perfect at distinguishing between his private and public life. The title of 'Flare Lord' was given to Benimaru. It was also a substitute for the title of 'True Demon Lord' since he could not call himself a demon lord even if he became a True Demon Lord. The words used stood for fierce anger. He used to be a bit short-tempered, but now he always seems to keep his cool. Nevertheless, his nature was still a fiery flame. It's just that he's learned to burn and control his anger quietly. As the first demon lord to serve me, there could be no more fitting title.

![break]

<<Question: Using the specified amount of 100,000 souls, will you evolve the individual Benimaru?

YES/NO>>

![break]

YES.

As soon as I agreed, a 'Soul Corridor' was created between me and Benimaru. It was not a thin connection as before, but a solid one. Through this, 100,000 souls would flow to Benimaru. At the same time, the evolution of Benimaru started---actually it didn't.

No change. Huh, is it a failure? Benimaru answered me with a thoughtful look on his face.

"Apparently, there is another condition for my evolution."

"What do you mean?"

"Ah, no, it looks like it's not Rimuru-sama's problem, but mine..."

For some reason, Benimaru was being ambiguous about what he was saying. What's going on? Something was fishy here.

"What's the problem?"

I asked Benimaru in a quiet voice. He gave me a surprising answer.

"Actually, I heard the Voice of the World too. Apparently, I can evolve from an oni to a divine oni, but then I won't be able to have children."

Benimaru said that divine oni had no need to have children because they had no life span. Well, that was true. Oni were also a race that lived quite a long time. It was not surprising that they would lose their life expectancies if they were a higher race. That means that divine oni were probably a kind of spiritual life form. It seems that even demons don't have children, which is the fate of a species without a lifespan. There was no need for the preservation of the species, since they could be revived even after death.

"So, what's the problem with that?"

Sadly, I can't have children either. But it wasn't an inconvenience, and I didn't see it as a problem...

"---It seems that I still have some unfinished business from when I was an ogre. I forgot about it myself, but I guess I have to finish my job as patriarch properly."

"Does that job mean you have to have children in order to evolve?"

"Well, um. It seems that it is necessary to leave a next generation..."

Benimaru and I were staring at each other again. We were currently in the middle of a celebration. It may look like I'm throwing congratulatory words to Benimaru to the participants, but if I don't do something quickly, they will know that there is a problem. A little impatiently, I looked at Benimaru. Then Benimaru looked at me awkwardly. It was rare to see Benimaru like this. I was deeply moved by his attitude because he is usually so fearless.

"Prepare yourself, Benimaru."

"No, but what?"

Ignoring Benimaru's attempts to make excuses, I raised my voice.

"I see. So you want to marry as a reward? So then, who is it?"

"Hey---Rimuru-sama!"

It was time for him to be a man---it wasn't any of my business, but I held myself high. After all this, Benimaru had no choice but to make up his mind. To get the late blooming Benimaru to act, this kind of rough treatment was necessary.

![break]

<<...Notice. This action may result in the strangulation of the Master.>>

![break]

*What?*

Wisdom King Raphael-san gave no answer to my query.

*No, no, no, it'll be all right.*

I said this to myself, and the Colosseum erupted in cheers. It seemed that everyone had heard my voice and understood what I said.

"Brother, so you have finally made up your mind!"

Shuna smiled brightly.

"So, young man, who are you going to nominate as your partner?"

Hakurou asked this question with his hand on his sword. Momiji and Alvis, who were in the guest of honor's seats, stood up before Benimaru could answer that question.

"Rimuru-sama! I would like to ask your permission to speak!"

"May I do the same? Like Momiji-sama, I have a request to make."

I sensed a strong conviction from both of them. It was not an atmosphere in which I could say 'no' anymore.

"Okay, okay. Now then, will you two please come with me?"

We were in the middle of a celebration, but I didn't think this was the time to talk about it. Those in the Colosseum were already spectators waiting for a good show. There was complaining---or rather, it would be more likely to cause dissatisfaction if we stopped now. The two who came were allowed to speak.

"Rimuru-sama, I would like to ask for permission to marry Benimaru-sama as a reward."

First, Momiji made a bold statement. And then, Hakurou followed him.

"Rimuru-sama, the reward shall be that which is given. It is impolite to demand otherwise. However, I beg you to grant my daughter's wish."

Hakurou requested Momiji to take over his own orders of merit as well. The way things were going now, it was difficult for me to refuse. Benimaru was frozen in his seat, unable to keep up with the situation. He was known for his good judgment, but now it seemed that he couldn't think straight. And then, another comment made the situation even more confusing.

"Rimuru-sama, please allow me to be Benimaru-sama's second wife!"

Even Alvis, who was late to Momiji's statement, started to say something like that. Benimaru and I couldn't help speaking in unison,

" "Huh?" "

Momiji and Alvis had been in a fierce battle over Benimaru. It was a well-known story to the point that it came to be known as an epic of love and war, so when did it end?

"So, Momiji as the first wife and Alvis as the second wife?"

"Yes!"

"That's right."

Momiji and Alvis answered with a happy look on their faces. Benimaru's eyes were white. I don't know what happened between them, but it seems that a clear pecking order had been established.

"It is unbecoming of a wife to annoy Benimaru-sama with such things. I do not ask you to choose one of us, me or Alvis-san, so please take us both at the same time."

"Wait, that's not how it works..."

"It's okay. I discussed this with Momiji-sama, and we came to the conclusion that Benimaru-sama's caliber will not be a problem."

No, no, no, what kind of conclusion is that?! Benimaru was looking at me as if begging for my help. Well, I'm puzzled, too. I don't think I can help him so easily...

![break]

<<Answer. According to the current rules of the Jura-Tempest Federation, polygamy is allowed for the purpose of procreation. However, it is limited to widows who wish to have children. In this case, the second wife would not be allowed.>>

![break]

Oh, oh! That's right.

For some reason, I feel that Wisdom King Raphael-san is actively cooperating with me, and now I can help Benimaru.

"Unfortunately, Alvis-san, in our country, only a widow who wishes to have a child can become a second wife. In the future, we intend to make it a law, and there is a possibility that the rule will be changed, but right now, we can't allow..."

Feeling sorry, I tried to deny Alvis' request. Benimaru nodded his head in relief, but it was a big mistake to think that this was the end of the story.

"Don't worry. I've been studying the rules of this country. Actually, I got married just a few days ago---"

Wait, she got married the other day?? With whom? I mean, in that case, it's impossible for her to get married to Benimaru, right? I thought so, but what Alvis said after that was beyond my imagination.

"---And I was sadly separated from my husband by death. Therefore, I fulfill the conditions to be the second wife of Benimaru-sama."

Huh? Wait a minute, wait a minute, that's not because of the war, is it?

If so, that would be a big problem...Alvis's argument was so cunning that I felt foolish for worrying about it.

"Wait, wait, wait, what? Who was the husband of yours who you married?"

"That would be Phobio over there in the guest of honor section," Alvis told me with a smile.

"..."

Um, Phobio-san, you're still alive, right? Benimaru and I were confused and looked at each other.

<What's going on?>

<I don't know, you're asking me!>

<But that...>

We had a conversation only by looking at each other without even having to use the 'Telepathy Net'. Phobio came up to us and knelt down with an apologetic look on his face.

"I'm really sorry. My Alvis is speaking so self-righteously."

"No, no, no. You were married? More importantly, are you dead??"

"About that..."

And so the story began. Momiji, Alvis, and Phobio explained to me the whole story of Alvis's plan. In a nutshell.

Momiji and Alvis had developed a kind of friendship through many fist fights. Then, Momiji and Alvis decided to change directions by assisting each other instead of fighting each other. What should they do so that they could both become Benimaru's wife? The answer they came up with was for Alvis to marry Phobio. After marrying Phobio, the two would fight in the labyrinth until one of them died. Alvis then won and reported herself as a widow. Since they had only fought a duel in the labyrinth, Phobio was still alive, of course.

"If I won, she said she would marry me. So, can I cry?"

So that's the reason why Phobio went along with the plan...

The sight of Phobio drooping his head was so pathetic that I couldn't help but feel sorry for him. I mean, what should be done in this case?

"Rigurd, is this possible?"

"Ha! It's a very simple and straightforward theory of power. This is the result of using wisdom and power to get what you want. If you ask me, this is totally fine!"

I see. Regurd, Rogurd, and Rugurd nodded their heads in agreement with Rigurd's statement. Seriously. In the eyes of a monster, Alvis's action is a good thing.

"Brother. Momiji-sama and Alvis-sama have shown their determination up to this extent. Please be a man and give them your reply!"

Shuna was also in favor of Alvis's action? No, Shuna wasn't the only one.

"If you don't like it, tell them you don't like it, if it bothers you, tell them it bothers you, right? What's there to worry about?"

In the case of Shion, she doesn't seem to be thinking much about it, but she still made a pretty good argument. Still, she does not seem to be against Benimaru taking two wives, and is simply urging them to answer. Surprisingly, there are no objections. No one seems to have any thoughts that this is unethical or unclean. Indeed, survival of the fittest is the rule of monsters. The strong takes everything, and is only limited by the rules I have set. If they want it, and no one complains about it, I think it's okay to accept this.

"Benimaru, how long do you intend to keep worrying about this? Your father will laugh at you in the afterlife if you keep being so indecisive."

"Souei...you may say so, but my father loved only my mother and brought me and Shuna into this world. What's wrong with me wanting to be like him?"

Benimaru seems to be unusually agitated, perhaps because Souei's words were painful to his ears. However, Souei did not budge.

"I didn't say it was bad. You seem to doubt your love, but why don't you just have children? If a man and a woman don't love each other, they can't have a child. If you don't have feelings for them, then just say no from the beginning. But if you have even a little bit of feelings for them, why don't you just hold them and show them the result?"

Souei-san, you are too blunt. Although it seemed like harsh sexual harassment, I hated the fact that it looked so good on him. And the argument appeared to make sense to the monsters. I forgot that no child could be born without love. Benimaru is troubled because he feels it is unfaithful to love both of them at the same time. Moreover, choosing one or the other would cause grief to the one who remains. That is why he has been postponing to give an answer. I didn't dislike that kind of thinking. But in this case, if we show the result as Souei says, all the problems would be solved, wouldn't they?

"Alvis-san, let's see who can conceive Benimaru-sama's child first!"

"I won't lose, Momiji-sama. My love is real. All that's left is to win Benimaru-sama's heart!"

I think that was the hardest part, but they don't seem to be bothered by it. It was all up to Benimaru's heart.

"Benimaru, we are in the middle of a celebration. It's a place to honor your deeds. I will allow you all your selfishness, so please answer me sincerely. Will you respond to Momiji and Alvis' courtship or not? Which is it?"

If Benimaru does not like it, we will be done talking about it. But if not...

"Momiji, Alvis, as the 'Samurai general' protecting Rimuru-sama, I may not be able to stay by your side forever. Still, are you willing to choose me?"

Benimaru was sincere to the end. He was worried about the future. When Benimaru has no more regrets after having children, he will evolve into a divine oni. Then he will no longer have a life span, and there will come a time when he will forever be separated from Momiji and Alvis. Of course. Since only he will evolve, his two wives will be left behind...

In a situation like this, it was a bit harsh to ask for an answer so suddenly. Even I, though I don't feel it yet, would find it hard to see my loved one leave me before I do. Well, I am not talking about a specific individual, but about all my friends in general. I could understand Benimaru's concern, and I thought that Momiji and Alvis might also be affected, but my fears were unfounded.

"No problem at all! After I raise my children, I will somehow evolve as well."

"I agree with you. And even if evolution is impossible, my children will comfort you in your ennui."

Women are so strong. These two showed her determination as if unfazed. Hearing their reply, Benimaru gave a fresh smile.

"Rimuru-sama! May I have your permission to take two wives?"

I could not and would not say no here. It would set an unreasonable precedent, but if they would be allowed to do so if they perform well, as they have done in this case, it might give them hope and encourage them to work harder. I decided that it was okay.

Benimaru is a pure-hearted man who pretends to be hard-core. If I had left him alone, he would have been a bachelor forever, and I would consider this as a good opportunity for him. If there is a concern, it is if he could love both Momiji and Alvis at the same time, but I believe that Benimaru will be able to get through this. And I will cheer for him, too. I jumped out of my chair and changed into human form. Then, I announced loudly:

"Permission granted! In my name, I grant Benimaru, Momiji, and Alvis the right to 'the union of souls'!"

In the case of monsters, marriage is like a union of souls. It is obvious from the fact that no child can be born without love. That is why it is appropriate to call it 'the union of souls'. Hearing my declaration, a smile was etched on Benimaru's mouth. His face was dyed red with joy, and he was still clutching Momiji and Alvis in his arms, his chest outstretched.

![full page image](image2)

"Thank you. I will surely love them both and show them my sincerity!"

Momiji and Alvis were in tears of joy after hearing Benimaru's magnificent speech. They seemed to be speechless with emotion. Honestly, I'm so envious of Benimaru. A beautiful girl and a beautiful woman, they were truly a flower in each hand. But... I guess it will be difficult for the shy Benimaru from now on. Well, I can't speak for others either. In my case, I'm asexual, so there's no use in thinking about it...

![break]

Benimaru's speech was greeted with loud cheers in the Colosseum. Shuna was happily congratulating her brother, and Shion was clapping proudly for some reason. Of course, I heard not only the congratulations but also some jealous and resentful voices, but that much was still a blessing. Thus, Momiji, Alvis, and Benimaru were celebrating amidst the cheers of the participants in this festive event.

I would have liked to continue the celebration, but we were in the middle of the event and I wanted to give priority to the evolutionary rituals. Let's just announce it now and have Benimaru's wedding ceremony slowly after this evolutionary rite called 'victory celebration' is over. We were going to have a banquet again today, but the more the merrier. So, for now, the priority was on the celebration event. I let the happy Benimaru and company move back and ordered Shuna to just make the arrangements. The incessant cheering finally died down when I raised my hand. It was indeed an unexpected happening. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Gobua breaking down in tears, and for some reason Phobio was comforting them, but there is no time for that now. We decided to continue the celebration.

![soft scene break]

I reverted back to my slime form and sat down on the chair. After watching me, Shuna's dignified voice echoed in the hall, where the excitement had not yet cooled down.

"The three grand corps commanders, step forward!"

The three corps commanders are the commanders of the First, Second, and Third Corps. That is, Gobta, Geld, and Gabil knelt before me. Let's start with Gobta.

"Ahem! Gobta-kun, you will not be rewarded!"

I said this to Gobta, who was looking at me with an expectant expression.

"What? That's terrible! Then, why did you call me here?"

"That's a good question. I don't have a reward for you, but I'm going to give you one right in return."

"A right?"

Giving souls to Gobta will not make him evolve. He is a talented guy, but he is not qualified for it. I considered giving Gobta weapons and armor, but I decided that Gobta could not handle more than what I am giving him now. Besides, he can 'Magic Wolf Unification' with Ranga anyway, so he doesn't need any half-assed armor. Even if I gave him money, he would not use it for anything useful. What's more, the corps commanders are well-paid. He should be able to make a good living, since he receives a considerable amount of money points every month. In the case of a human nation, we would have given him a territory, but our country does not have any territory that can be ceded. Besides, Gobta would not be able to rule, so this was a meaningless example. And so, I decided to grant Gobta special rights.

Gobta was puzzled by my words. I guess he did not understand what I meant by the word 'right' alone. Then, I will just tell him the answer.

"You have the right to treat me 'casually', with the same informal tone that you have always been using up until now!"

I flashed a smirk at Gobta, who remained puzzled, and declared as such. Before Gobta could even comprehend my words, there was a roar of cheers---or rather, shouts of rage---that was even louder than the one that had just been given to Benimaru. It was a cheer so loud that it was impossible to hide any jealousy. Even Shion and Shuna were staring at Gobta with terrifying eyes. They seemed to be very envious.

"Oh, uh, are you serious?"

"After all, you can't even speak honorifics, can you? I'm afraid you're going to screw it up big time one day, so I've decided to take this opportunity to recognize it as your right."

Gobta's tone of voice was not good at all, though I could also sense his respect. I mean, I usually tell everyone to talk to me casually, but it seems to be quite difficult. In such a situation, there have been frequent complaints about Gobta's informal conversational style. They wanted me to do something about it because it would affect my external reputation. Since that was a hassle, I decided to recognize it as a 'right'. There were many foreign guests such as Phobio and Jaine-san at this celebration. The idea was that the publicity here would solve Gobta's problem.

Well, I guess there are a lot of other troublesome things to worry about, such as appearance and authority, but we, as monsters, did not need such a formal system. I would just do what I wanted to do. What is important is not what is on the outside but what is on the inside. Gobta is a good example.

His tone may have been foul, but his loyalty was real. I could see it in his eyes. Gobta had a look in his eyes that says he is willing to die for me. That's why this is his 'right'.

"Thank you!"

Gobta bowed with a big smile, bending at a ninety-degree angle. He was overjoyed. Perhaps, he had been trying to correct his tone of voice. It hadn't worked at all, though. I am happy for Gobta that it was the best reward for him. Appropriate rewards were really hard to come up with.

![soft scene break]

Next, after Gobta, there was Geld.

"Geld, from this day forward, you can call yourself the 'Barrier Lord'!"

"I, Geld, accept this title! I will strive to live up to the name 'Barrier Lord'!"

Geld responded strongly. Amidst the loud cheers, I secretly told Geld my message behind the scenes.

"I will attempt the same evolutionary ritual on you as I did on Benimaru."

"Just what is that...?"

I didn't want to explain it every time, so I connected a 'Telepathy Net' to those who were going to be given souls. Then, I explained about the evolutionary ritual to all of them. At this time, I also remembered to use 'Thought Acceleration' in combination with 'Telepathy Net'. By doing this, we could have an important conversation in less than a few seconds in real time. After a brief explanation, Geld responded.

<I appreciate the offer, but I think there is someone better qualified for this reward. Carrera-dono, the inspector general, has been a major player in this war. If she is also qualified, then by all means, please let Carrera-dono take the reward instead of me--->

Hmmm, declining to awaken with a soul's power?

I did not plan to have Carrera evolve this time. I had no doubt that Carrera was a major player, but I did not want her to go out of control when she gained power, even though she was already so dangerous at this stage. Because I needed to take a wait-and-see attitude, I wanted to wait on evolving Carrera in the meantime, choosing to advance the oldest and most reliable subordinates. I explained as such, but Geld was still hesitating.

<But I am also...>

So, Geld was worried. He was afraid that he would get too powerful and lose control. And perhaps he was still trying to make amends. Amends for the great disaster that he had caused in the Great Jura Forest by his outburst at that time. As the one who bears the responsibility, he was strictly controlling himself. His eyes were shining with strong will, and he looked at me with determination. That is why I answered him.

<Don't worry, Geld. Even though Geld, the orc disaster, went berserk, it was for the sake of his friends, wasn't it?>

Geld would not lose control. If he had that much determination, he would be able to control whatever power he gained. And...

There was no one left to denigrate Geld because of past events.

<You still feel responsible, but I believe in you. And I know you will use your newfound strength to protect us all!>

As Geld evolves, his servants will also receive a gift. That means our country will gain a strong defense. When I explained this, Geld's eyes shone brightly.

<...If that's the case, I humbly accept!>

He agreed. As expected of Geld. A man who works for the good of his people, not for himself. By the way, there was no one who refused, except for Geld. Some of them seemed to be anxious, but I felt that their expectations were higher than their apprehensions. It was my fault that I did not confirm their intentions beforehand, but momentum was important in this case. I was relieved that everyone agreed to the plan. I deactivated the 'Telepathy Net' and resumed the festivities.

"Your work has been truly outstanding. As a reward, I give you this."

Then I signaled to Shuna. Shuna nodded with a smile and handed Geld a set of equipment she had prepared. The armor and shield were legendary-grade equipment that I had acquired in this battle, and I modified them myself in consultation with Garm. It was an exclusive weapon that only Geld could use by reacting to his monstrous aura. The principle was the same as that of the 'Holy Spirit Armor', which could not be reproduced even by Garm.

The difference between mythical-grade and legendary-grade is the maturity level of the armor itself. The weapons themselves evolved over a long period of time. The evolution varied from one to another, and the number of years required depended on the materials. In addition, it was said that the speed of evolution increased dramatically if the owner was superior. Since Geld had a defensive specialization, I expected that even legendary-grade equipment would soon have a defensive ability comparable to that of mythical-grade equipment. On the contrary, Wisdom King Raphael-san said that there was a high possibility that Geld would gain a gift with his evolution. I am sure that it would reach the mythical-grade. If that happened, his defense would be much stronger. Geld accepted his prize reverently and bowed to me.

![break]

<<Question: Using the specified amount of 100,000 souls, will you evolve the individual Geld?

YES/NO>>

![break]

YES---After doing this, I called out to Geld.

"You've been giving yourself a hard time, all these years. This is a good time for you to get some rest, and to think about what you wish to do for yourself."

Geld will not only fight in battles, but will continue to play an active role in the construction of the city. He has been working hard all his life and rarely takes a proper rest. He was probably the hardest worker in the country. I hoped that he would take this opportunity to take a good rest.

"Yes! Thank you very much for this happiness!" Geld replied, smiling happily.

Then he returned to the line in a nonchalant manner, as if resisting the evolutionary slumber caused by the influence of the Harvest Festival on a demon lord.

![soft scene break]

How did he overcome that sleepiness? I was so impressed that I turned my attention to the next person. Gabil. He had led the Third Corps in a brilliant aerial battle. When I congratulated him, he looked down with a sincere face.

"It wasn't enough. I am ashamed of my lack of talent."

...Truth be told, Gabil really deserved it. The idea of having magic endurance training in the middle of a war is something that no one could imitate. Or rather it's not that I can't imitate it, but that I wouldn't want to imitate it. After the battle, I received a detailed report from Ultima, and was appalled at how stupid they had been. She even advised that Gabil-san should be punished. I didn't know when he had become such an experiment-loving bastard...

But thanks to that, it seems that Gabil and his team have figured out the secret of dragonewt's Intrinsic Skill-'Dragon Body'. I would have a big heart and not get angry this time. Besides, there were more important things for now. I also switched to 'Telepathy Net' and spoke to Gabil. It was a private chat, since it would be counterproductive to scold him in front of everyone.

<I'll speak more about the experiments during the war later, but there is this. Ultima has a proposal. She is willing to teach you how to control your magicules.>

<What did you say?>

<For the demon race, dealing with magicules is as easy as breathing. She is willing to take care of you guys, so please get along with her and ask her for advice.>

He might only be assuaged if I punish him, but it would be better for him to be treated by Ultima. As you know, Ultima would understand how to be lenient and only suffer a little before they could reflect on themselves. That was my decision.

"We are still inexperienced. I, Gabil, am grateful to you for giving us an opportunity to grow further! We will strive to meet Rimuru-sama's expectations so that all of us can master the 'Dragon Body'!"

The response was surprisingly positive. It seems that they were prepared for it. Gabil, too, missed the days when he used to be beaten by Gobta. His goofy personality had calmed down a lot now. He had learned to read the atmosphere around him and had gained the dignity of a warlord. As he said, he still had some ways to go, but it seems that he had certain qualities to begin with, and through the bitter defeats and his interactions with Vesta and others, he had now acquired a thoughtful mindset.

He was now a reliable person. The experiences he had accumulated have helped Gabil to grow up. Therefore, I could trust him with power.

"I will give you power. Use it well and awaken as the 'Draco Lord'!"

I gave Gabil the souls and encouraged him to evolve. Unlike Geld, Gabil's evolution was dramatic. His blackish-purple scales turned reddish-purple, and fiery magicules ran through his body. Gabil, however, endured the situation admirably. He kept his consciousness only with his spirit, and controlled himself. The experiment was not in vain, and it had borne fruit.

"Wooooooooooo! I feel full of power! Thank you, Rimuru-sama! From this day forward, I shall call myself 'Draco Lord'. And for the sake of Rimuru-sama and this country, I will use this power to my utmost!"

A purple lightning shot was released from Gabil's body and roasted himself. However, Gabil's body began to heal instantly, transforming into a stronger body. It seems that it was a success. Perhaps because I told him to call himself a 'Lord', but Gabil now had a magnificent horn sprouting from his forehead. Gabil looked very handsome and well-fitted, even if he was a bit cocky. But that was all right. It was a magnificent evolution of both dignity and power. Thus, the 'Draco Lord' Gabil was born.

![break]

That said, it seems that the evolution into a 'True Demon Lord' varies from individual to individual. I myself had fallen into an irresistible deep sleep, and Geld was currently trying his best to stay awake. Benimaru needed additional conditions. In Gabil's case, it was all done in a moment, without even falling asleep.

"Gabil-sama, I'm feeling full of energy too!"

"Indeed!"

"Me too. Gabil-sama is the best!"

Such voices could be heard from the corner where the Third Corps was lined up. It was the group of a hundred Hiryuu. The lizardmen who were members of the Blue Numbers also seemed to be receiving gifts. All three thousand of them had evolved into dragonewts. The Hiryuu had successfully broken through the barrier of A rank, and had gained enough fighting ability to be called mid-level majin. It was as if their 'Dragon Body' was now normalized and the Skill itself was gone. The 'Dragon Scaling' skill, which transformed the skin into dragon scales, also seemed to have disappeared, and they gained a new skill called 'Dragon Skin' in its place.

I would leave the control of power to Ultima, but the problem was the newly acquired skill. It covered the body with self-repairing armor, taking in the surrounding magicules. In principle, it was the same as 'body armor', but its defense was incomparably higher. Since it regenerated even small scratches, it was very economical and did not require any protective gear. Moreover, the strength of the skill varied from person to person, and increased in proportion to the strength of the user. I was surprised to see that the strength of Gabil's 'Dragon Skin', for example, had jumped up to almost mythical-grade protection.

Naturally, that kind of perfect defense was also reflected in the attack. Although they were still dragonewts in terms of their race, they had been so strengthened that it would not be an exaggeration to say that they were different from other dragonewts. In the end, they could not be humanized, but that was not important because it was a matter of personal will.

![break]

And then there were the others. Surprisingly, even Souka and the others were affected by the evolution of Gabil. Those of this group were humanoid dragonewts. Since they were still in human form, their defense was inferior. However, their speed and attack power had been greatly increased. The skill possessed by these dragonewts was the same as that of 'Dragon Body', but while still retaining a human face after the transformation, which was different from Gabil's group. It seems that the scales and wings of a dragon can be taken in and out at will, but after the transformation, they appeared to become majin with the motif of a dragon's figure.

Although they were the same species as Gabil and the others, they seemed to follow completely different evolutionary paths. If they continued to evolve further, they might even become another species. In terms of strength, Souka and her members are superior to those of the Hiryuu. They had been strengthened to the extent that one could call them 'greater majin', and Souka herself had enough magicules to be comparable to an archdemon. As expected, they had succeeded in greatly increasing their strength.

![soft scene break]

Okay, now to get the three corp commanders out of here before calling the next ones in.

"Ranga, Hakurou, Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera. Come forward!"

With Gobta, one could not forget Ranga. And then there was Hakurou, who was the advisor. And then there were the three demon girls who had been appointed as inspectors and intelligence officers. When I called Ranga, he appeared quietly from my shadow. Hakurou, too, appeared without a sign. Testarossa was graceful, Ultima was light, and Carrera was majestic. They came up to the dais and knelt before me.

Now that they were all here, I would reward them in turn. First was Ranga. He had assisted Gobta and did a job well done.

"Ranga, you not only fought alongside Gobta, but you protected him as well, so I thank you."

"What do you mean, my lord? I merely did what I had to do!"

Hahaha, what a cute guy. Still, I was well aware how happy he was to hear my compliments by the wagging of his tail.

"Well then, from this day forward, you can call yourself the 'Star Lord'!"

"Yes!"

Ranga roared and accepted. Immediately, a 'Soul Corridor' was established between us. Ranga, as in my case, began to evolve instantly and the Harvest Festival seems to have started.

"Gggggh, my lord..."

"Are you sleepy? Then take it easy."

There was nothing to be patient about. I put Ranga back in my shadow and let him sleep. By the looks of things, I'm sure the wolves under my command had received the gift as well. I was very much looking forward to seeing what would happen after the evolution. Ranga did not run rampant, and fell asleep in my shadow. The four were now done. At this rate, it seemed like I would have nothing to worry about, but let's just continue the ritual without letting up until the end.

![break]

Next was Hakurou.

"You have done a great job in your role as Gobta's advisor. Thank you."

"It's nothing. Gobta is growing up, and soon he won't need my help."

"No, no, no, there is a big difference between the presence and absence of Hakurou. So, as for the reward---"

"Wait a moment, Rimuru-sama. For my part, it is enough that you have listened to my daughter Momiji's wishes."

Oh, I remember him saying that earlier. However, I can't just leave it at that, can I?

<Those are two different things. I wish Benimaru and Momiji the best. Besides, it must be complicated for you as a father, now that Alvis-san has intervened, isn't it?>

I spoke to Hakurou through 'Telepathy Net' again. Telepathy Net' was very useful for me because I could talk in front of many people without worrying about time.

<I thought about that a little. But I believe in young Benimaru-sama. And my daughter's eyes are also reliable. So, I am satisfied.>

<That's good. I believe Benimaru will make them both happy.>

But God only knows if they will have children or not.

<So...>

<Wait a minute. Aren't awards for merit important? Besides, the prize I prepared for you is the work I asked Kurobee to do for me. I hope you will accept it so that Kurobee's efforts won't go to waste.>

That's right. I had prepared Hakurou a newly forged sword. Recently, Kurobee has been improving his skills rapidly. The quality of his work is excellent, and it was a legendary-grade sword.

By the way, Benimaru's 'Red Lotus' was also made by Kurobee's hands. Benimaru was not able to show his true potential in the previous battle due to the difference in the performance of his weapons. Kurobee, who heard that, had blamed himself for it and became inspired by the fact. He shut himself up in his workshop, determined to forge him the best sword he could. Kurobee's sword, though not quite as good as the Red Lotus, was a sword forged with his heart and soul. Hakurou would surely appreciate it.

<Oh, Kurobee...in that case, I will accept it with gratitude!>

<Yes, feel free to take it!>

Good, good, good. If he declined, I would have been at a loss as to what to do. I still think he is a little too modest, though modesty is a virtue. In that case, let's continue.

"Don't worry about it. This is for you. Take it!"

"Rimuru-sama's kindness shall not be wasted. I, Hakurou humbly accept this sword!"

Hakurou smoothly received the sword.

![break]

Next, it was time to move on to the three demon girls. Actually, I had a hard time deciding what to do at first. If I were to consider only increasing our strength, it would be natural to evolve the three demon peers. But as I explained to Benimaru and Geld, I decided not to evolve them at this time. One of the reasons was that I did not have enough souls, but the other reason was that I myself am not sure if I could control them. As long as I do not know how strong they can become, they'll have to be put on hold. Since these three were the same level as Diablo, I decided to let Diablo evolve first and see how it goes.

Frankly, Diablo makes me a little uneasy in another sense, but...well, it's better not to think too much about that for now. From my point of view, Diablo seems to be one of the strongest. Even amongst the 'primordials', there seems to be some variation in strength depending on their personalities. The three demon girls are under my direct control, and I have them put under Diablo's care. Therefore, I will think about their evolution after Diablo's evolution is completed and settled.

Even so, the souls I have currently are not enough to evolve them. There seems to be some sort of check and balance formed between these three, so I think it would be problematic to give them a chance to question superiority or inferiority. If anything, it would be too dangerous. Unless they all evolve at the same time, there would be trouble. I was tempted to consider only Carrera, since Geld suggested it, but I decided not to do it for that very reason.

Besides, Carrera possessed more than Diablo in terms of total magicules. It seemed too risky to give her power. Uncontrollable power is self-destructive---that's how I felt. After all, the nuclear magic that Carrera used---'Gravity Collapse'---was no good. If it had failed, even Geld and his friends would have been blown away. Though it was completely controlled, the character of a person who could unleash that kind of magic without hesitation in that situation made me feel a little uneasy. It's important to check safety in everything. I decided to wait and see how things would turn out before deciding whether to evolve her or not.

"Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera, you three have done an excellent job as intelligence officers. We are also making good use of the souls you have gathered for us. There may be dissatisfaction if I use what you have gathered for people other than yourselves---"

I had thought about keeping quiet about the evolution of the souls, but Testa and the others had been the main contributors to the collection of souls. I felt that it would be impolite to remain silent, so I confided in them, but they contradicted me with a force that interrupted my words.

"Rimuru-sama, what do you mean?! We have no complaints!"

"That's right! On the contrary, we are the ones who have not repaid you enough!"

"They are both right, milord. We are already content. We've been given bodies. And even a name. That alone is enough to make us strong."

All three, in unison, denied any possible dissatisfaction. Indeed, they were already more than strong enough. Even as they are now, they were stronger than the awakened Gabil. Hearing them say that, I was convinced. But not giving them rewards was another matter.

"I am glad to hear you say that. It makes me feel that my heart will always be with you. That is why I hope you will accept the reward I have prepared for you."

"A reward?"

"But..."

"There is no way out of it. If the lord has said so, how can I refuse?"

Right? If they refuse, it will be too much trouble, so I blocked the way out first.

"In recognition of your work this time, I am going to recognize you as executives. You will continue to work as usual, but in times of war, you will be given a part of the command authority. I will give you these titles as well."

'Killer Lord' Testarossa.

'Pain Lord' Ultima.

'Menace Lord' Carrera.

These were the titles I came up with after interviewing a few people. I know the names sound pretty brutal, but they reflect exactly what had been happening during this war. Their role as leaders was to fight, and I thought it suited them well.

"From this day forward, I permit you to call yourselves as such. From now on, I expect you to serve as my confidants, just like the senior executives!"

" " "By your will..." " "

Upon hearing my words, all three of them bowed their heads in unison. Apparently, they liked the new titles. I watched the five of them return to the line, feeling glad that I had not received any complaints.

![soft scene break]

The evolutionary rituals continued on. Next, I would call up those who had been active in the labyrinth. Gozer and Mezer were given a new set of equipment. I officially appointed Gadra as a Guardian of the 60th floor, and entrusted him with the Demon Colossus. Beretta was now retired as the head of 'Dungeon's Elite Ten'. Gadra was now officially a member of the 'Elite Ten'. As a reward, he would have access to the research facilities on each floor. From now on, he would be involved in the research side of things, too, anyway. I decided to trust him. He was overjoyed, so I guess it was a good reward for him. If he stole my research data, that would be the time to talk. However, I felt that it was a useless worry. He was a lovable old man, and I hoped he would do his best as an ally from now on.

So far, everything was going well. In that case, it was time to get down to business. Beretta and the four dragon kings who retired from the Elite Ten were not my subordinates. They were under Ramiris, so I would leave them aside for now.

Guardian of the 90th floor---'Nine head' Kumara.

Guardian of the 80th floor---'Insect Kaiser' Zegion.

Floor Boss of the 79th floor---'Insect Queen' Apito.

Guardian of the 70th floor---'Immortal King' Adalmann.

Vanguard of the 70th floor---'Death Paladin' Albert.

A lineup of eminent figures. At this point, there seemed to be no need to worry about anyone losing control. So it was time to evolve them one by one.

![break]

First up was Kumara. I had given Kumara the title of 'Chimera Lord'. Kumara seemed to have grown in stature, perhaps because she had successfully accomplished her revenge in this battle. Come to think of it, Kumara had been an enemy of mine when we first met. You never know how things will turn out in this world. Clayman had been manipulating her, but she was happy and proud to defeat Colonel Kansas who was the cause of the manipulation.

The reason why I entrusted her with the labyrinth was because Ranga told me that she was good at pioneering forests. I had been advised to entrust Kumara as the Guardian of the 90th floor, so I decided to entrust her with the job. If he had not said that, Kumara might still be a fox cub. I knew Kumara was a powerful young beast, but I had no idea that she would eventually become one of the 'Elite Ten'.

No, perhaps it was destined to happen the moment I gave her the name. In any case, I was thankful for Ranga's suggestion. Kumara was now the master of eight magic beasts. Each of the magic beasts that served as Floor Bosses on the 82-89th floors were so strong that they were equivalent to Calamity-class. They were the eight parts of Kumara, and they looked vaguely familiar to me, too.

A few days after naming Kumara, I once went to check on them while taking a walk. At that time, Kumara asked me to call each of her friends by name. I was introduced to a group of adorable child magic beasts. I have experienced countless failures in 'naming' monsters. Because I was such a person, I clearly understood the dangers of name-related matters. But all I had to do in this case was to call out the name of the tailed beast that Kumara had already decided on. I thought it was a good idea, and I accepted it with a casual feeling. Of course, it's not that I did it because a young girl asked me to, or because I had such a strong desire to do so---anyone can understand without any explanation. I didn't expect that it would turn out like this...

Now that I think about it, I suspect that it was actually a 'Naming' as well. After all, the eight animals introduced at that time did not have such a high fighting ability.

![break]

<<Answer. Yes. A similar phenomenon to 'naming' has been confirmed, although strictly speaking it is different. As a result, the bond between the tailed beasts and the individual Kumara has been strengthened.>>

![break]

Oh, I knew it. I didn't notice it because they didn't enter a mode of low activity and I didn't see any change in the magic beasts at that time, but I had thought as such ever since I saw their battle. The magic beasts who were once so cute were now the eight members, possessing a fierce power. It was an amazing before and after. Everyone was surprised. I was surprised too.

In effect, Kumara had received an equivalent of nine names from me. As a result, the bond between the eight and Kumara had been strengthened. And even the power that the tailed beasts had grown by absorbing the dense magicules of the labyrinth had been returned to the main body Kumara to give her strength overall. Well, there was no point in worrying about what has already been done. Kumara might have been defeated without it, so I will say that the result was overall good.

I awarded Kumara the souls. As soon as I did so, she succeeded in evolving into a demon lord. The eight beasts of Kumara's body shined and returned to her main body with a glow. Kumara then grew nine tails. One of the tails, which had originally remained, turned golden. The remaining eight tails became a shimmering silvery white. They were tails with very beautiful fur. But even more beautiful than that was Kumara herself.

Kumara's body turned out so voluptuous and seductive that she was completely unimaginable from her infantile appearance. She appeared to be even more attractive than before. Her long hair changed from brown to golden, like ears of rice reflecting the light, and it ran down her back, silky and shiny. Was it beauty that underwent evolution?

No, of course, the amount of magicules had increased. At this stage, she had already surpassed the awakened Gabil. I never expected her to reach this level. Kumara herself had a great deal of fighting power, but it was only when all the eight beasts were combined into a composite beast form (chimera mode) that she could display her most powerful ability. Conversely, Kumara becoming more powerful meant that the Eight Beasts would follow suit and also become more powerful. What's more, their souls were connected through my 'Naming', and a gift was given only to those eight...

And the most foul point was that the power given to them would be returned to Kumara, making her even stronger. In a sense, this was a monopoly of power. From Kumara, I sensed a sly, calculating nature that I could not have imagined based on her beautiful appearance. It was no wonder that Kumara did not get along with an honest and direct person like Apito. Still, there was no reason why such a drastic evolution should have to be such a burden on Kumara. Kumara seemed to be doing her best just to stay conscious. If she kept forcing herself like this, she may lose control, so this had to be stopped.

"Go back and get some rest." I ordered gently.

Kumara looked a little disappointed, but she obeyed my order honestly. Most likely, she would sleep like Ranga and get used to her increased strength. In any case, I was looking forward to seeing her growth. No, even now, she is already a great beauty at this stage of her life. Anyway, Kumara left and returned to her own guardian realm.

![soft scene break]

The celebration continued. Zegion and Apito were next. I started with Apito first, leaving Zegion for later.

"Apito, you did a great job in the last battle. That man Minits was by far the strongest of the Imperial generals. You fought him on equal terms. Your strength is real. You should be proud of yourself."

When all was said and done, it was not power that I desired from Apito. All I was really looking for was honey, and as long as the honey improved in its productivity and quality, that's all I could hope for. It was strange how Apito had become an 'Insect Queen' and a member of the 'Elite Ten' before I even realized it.

"Surely you jest. I, for one, was not even close to being ready. After losing all of my compatriots, I only managed to pull out a draw."

"No, no, nothing like that..."

I tried to deny it, but I couldn't speak after seeing Apito's smile.

"I did not achieve a complete victory this time. Therefore, I do not think I am entitled to a reward."

"You say that, but..."

"However, if I am allowed to make a wish, will you allow the souls of my brethren who died in the last battle to dwell in me once again?"

What? What did you say? She doesn't want any reward, but suddenly she's asking for something this crazy! These guys, they are definitely mistaking me for some amazing guy who can do anything, aren't they? How can anything like this be---

![break]

<<Answer. It is possible.>>

![break]

So you can do it! Myself aside, the Wisdom King Raphael-san is awesome.

"Okay. Then I will let the spirits of the dead board you."

Apito's brethren were such demonic bugs that she didn't even need to give them 'Resurrection Bracelets'. I wondered whether I could call them 'Heroic Spirits' or not, but I said as such on this occasion.

"I am grateful for this happiness."

Apito was not qualified to evolve, but perhaps Zegion's evolution would give her a gift. That's why I decided to give her what she wished for. Since Apito was pleased, I decided that this was the right choice.

Next was Zegion. I thought of putting off Zegion's reward because he was the strongest, but I felt that it would be unnecessary to worry about it. After all, just by looking at his calmness told me that he would have nothing to do, losing control. As expected, he was the most powerful being in the labyrinth. Wisdom King Raphael-san also recognized his exceptional fighting sense, and his magicule count was as high as Benimaru's. After taking Veldora as a teacher, he had even mastered the dubious fighting techniques of manga. No wonder he was so strong. In this war as well, he alone had defeated the strongest of the Imperial Army whom the other 'Elite Ten' members would have had a difficult time against.

They would be fools if they lost the battle against them at the same time. Zegion, however, was able to beat them with a crushing defeat, without letting them get away with it. He proved that he was a very powerful fighter. Although it was speculation, Zegion was probably stronger than any normal demon lord now. Even I, an awakened 'True Demon Lord', might lose to him if I let my guard down. But to awaken such a Zegion...

I had heard that even Diablo and his colleagues couldn't beat him, so I was really getting worried. However, that was then and this is now. There were already several awakened demon lords in the making, so it was too late to worry about this now. I had already given souls to five of them, and the evolution ritual was still underway. As proof, I had been feeling an influx of power. The Harvest Festival of those who had fallen asleep was being returned to me through the 'Food Chain'. It was a lot of power, but my body was taking it in without any problem as if it were a tank short on fuel.

It shouldn't be a problem. Momentum was the key for this kind of thing, and I would just go with it. Don't be afraid and keep moving forward! That's basically how I felt. Thinking about things the other way around. How strong would Zegion become? Thinking of it that way, I felt excited. There was a possibility that Zegion would surpass me, but as long as the 'Food Chain' was there, my advantage would not be reversed. Believing this, I resumed the ritual without worrying about it.

"You're really something. To be honest, I didn't expect you to be this strong."

"It is all thanks to Rimuru-sama and his guidance!"

No, it was Veldora who taught you, wasn't it---wait? Wisdom King Raphael-san had been sneaking around behind my back, too. Then perhaps he thought that was me. It would be too much trouble to correct him, so I decided to just leave it at that.

"No need to be modest. It's only due to your untiring efforts. Please continue to hone your strength for me. And from this day forward, I will allow you to call yourself the 'Mist Lord'."

"Yes, I was moved with awe!"

Zegion was as taciturn as ever, but he was inspired and motivated by my words. What might have sounded like random words to me, must have sounded like gospel to Zegion. I guess he had more of a worship filter than I expected, but it's not too bad to be admired at this level, is it? I originally thought that I would just be protecting a rare insect, but as it turned out, I was now the one being protected. Zegion's growth was not something I deliberately cultivated, but was rather due to his talent. In addition to that, there was the dense magic leaking out of Veldora and the training environment in which one can come back to life even after death. Also, there was a training partner who was so much better than Zegion. One could not ask for more.

Well, the reasons were still trivial. He got stronger as a result, that's all that mattered. I gave Zegion the souls. Zegion trembled for a moment, but he managed to control the flood of power with his will alone. Unlike Gabil's case, he was enduring it with sheer perseverance. Seeing him do that made me feel a bit gutless for falling asleep so easily. I didn't think that was something that could be done with just spirit or guts, but I couldn't deny it now after seeing the real example in front of my eyes. Zegion evolved into an extremely terrifying being. According to his will, a part of his outer shell was transformed into hihiirokane. In addition to being coupled with various laws, Zegion's exoskeleton was comparable to a mythical-grade hardness.

This meant that his body itself was a weapon. In terms of combat ability alone, Zegion was unquestionably the strongest. Although for spiritual life forms, strength in combat did not affect their superiority...but even so, they were sure to be a threat. Even now, while Zegion was still in the process of evolution, he seemed to be acquiring various other abilities. It would be exciting to see how he gradually evolved later on. Despite Zegion's suppression by force of will, the Harvest Festival was definitely still taking place. And as expected, Apito appeared to be the only target of a gift.

Zegion and Apito were the only ones I had helped by giving them my own cells. That is why Apito was the only blood relative for Zegion. Although there were other dangerous species in the hierarchy of bugs, they were nearly wiped out in this defense battle. They would not be resurrected, but would have to wait for natural emergence. The rest were Apito's dependents, but all of them had been killed. The souls of these bugs were given to Apito just now. I wondered what she was going to do with them, but it seemed as if she was going to use them for her own enhancement. The result of her evolution would prove it. During the celebration, Apito also did not look distressed in front of me. She remained calm and endured with the dignity of a queen. Like Zegion, I was impressed by her performance. With admiration for the both of them, I told them to return to their places.

.........

......

...

As soon as the celebration was over, Zegion and Apito returned to their home in the labyrinth and became cocoons. With that, they would smoothly complete their evolution. Apito consumed the gift from Zegion along with the souls of her dependents and subordinate bugs. Through that she received an enormous amount of energy in her body. As a result, her flesh collapsed, and she was reborn with a stronger and more battle-ready body.

Apito was reborn, and with the Unique Skill 'Queen Worship' that she had acquired, she managed to create as many as nine insect-type majins, each with the characteristics of multiple types of bugs. The Unique Skill 'Queen Worship' was the ability to take in the ecology of the bugs she had eaten and produce them as majin. In the future, a swarming community of majin would be formed on this floor. Apito would reign as the true queen. Apito was both a member of the 'Elite Ten' and a follower of Zegion. Therefore, Zegion would not be shy about pouring favor upon Apito. Thus, it was understandable that Apito evolved abnormally.

![break]

Even if Apito, the recipient of the gift, had evolved to such a great extent, Zegion was no exception. Although his physical strength had evolved, the amount of magicules in his body surpassed that of an awakened Clayman. However, there was one Skill acquired by evolution that was even more problematic. While Apito's 'Queen Worship' skill was an amazing power in its own right, and also possessed such a broken performance that it could be compared to the great sin skills, Zegion's power was completely different. He had acquired the Ultimate Skill 'Illusion King Mephisto'---a true ultimate power. As a disciple of Veldora, he had obtained a Skill that was truly worthy of him. With this power, Zegion was the undisputed king of the labyrinth. A paradise of bugs created by Apito. As king and queen, Zegion and Apito would establish their absolute position.

![soft scene break]

With that, the remaining labyrinth group was Adalmann's group. Adalmann had lots of faith in me and was a bit of a---well, he was a huge nutcase. If I'm being honest, he was like a Diablo of sorts. Although, it was because of this that he was able to use 'holy magic', so it wasn't all bad...

Adalmann was also a good friend of Master Gadra, and it was said that they used to work together on various studies in the past. That's probably why he was able to create the Extra Skill 'Holy-Demonic Reversal' to eliminate his weak points. I didn't think much of it before, but perhaps he was a kind of genius. It sounds strange for someone without a brain to be so smart, but if it is a monster you're talking about, then it makes sense. Some monsters even possess arithmetic circuits in their astral and spiritual bodies, giving them the ability to think without their bodies.

And then there were even some psychics who thought not with their brains but with their hearts. Shion and her group that had acquired 'perfect memory' were brought to mind. That was merely a reproduction of memories, but if they developed and continued to think with their souls and astral bodies, they would be released from their lifespans and be called mental organisms. In this case, almost all physical attacks would not cause any fatal injuries, and even if they lost their bodies, they would be able to regenerate. They were no longer under any danger unless they were attacked by special attacks or by weapons of legendary-grade or higher.

In the case of Adalmann, he had not yet reached that point. The wight king was a spiritual monster, but he was bound by the yoke of his body. Because his spiritual body contained the thinking circuit, life span had nothing to do with Adalmann. Even so, he could not reach the point where he could continue to exist as long as he had a soul and an astral body. Although he was as close and existence to a spiritual life form as possible, he was not immortal. Such was the nature of his existence.

And the same was true for Albert, the 'death paladin', along with the death dragon. They had learned to be prudent enough to fight while covering their weak points. Adalmann's specialty was long-range attacks with magic. He supported Albert, who was the vanguard of the group, while also providing magical support. The Death dragon attacked from the sky, and when Albert was exhausted or damaged, it immediately took his place as a wall. This coordination was their winning formula for battle. To defeat this team, a special means of attack was necessary.

![break]

However, this time, the opponent was just too bad. In this world, there was always someone better.

As was the case with Hinata's 'Holy Spirit Armor', a master who can handle legendary-grade weapons can cut off any kind of attribute. Even if they were immortal, it did not matter. Hakurou was an example. Hakurou would be able to freely use the legendary-grade sword that I gave him as a prize. Doing so would greatly increase his strength. And while such a person would be good as an ally, this time, the enemy possessed a legendary-grade sword. Moreover, the user was of the highest military force of the Imperial Guard---the top ranks of the Imperial Guardians.

Albert's sword, though a failure forged by Kurobee, was a unique-grade sword. However, the enemy's sword was of legendary-grade. The reason why Albert had been able to defeat the opponent even though he was fighting with inferior quality weapons was because his skill-level was superior. In the end, Albert's sword was shattered and his team lost because of it, but it would be wrong to blame Albert for this. Rather, he should be praised for fighting such a great battle.

"Although the results were unfortunate, you guys fought very well. Especially you Albert, your swordsmanship was one of the best I have ever seen!"

"I am deeply honored."

"Adalmann, you too. Before I knew it, you mastered all of the magic I taught you. I feel that I have something to learn after witnessing your devotion."

I was not planning to follow his example though because it would be too much of a pain in the ass. I had no desire to do research unless it was something that interested me. However, I had an excellent partner, Wisdom King Raphael-san, in my place, and Adalmann's research results would be useful in the future.

"How can that be? I, for one, am not even a whisper close to the fullness of Rimuru-sama's wisdom."

Not mine, but Wisdom King Raphael-san's, right? Well, I wasn't going to point out anything though.

"Don't be so modest. Adalmann, I will give you greater strength. I hope you will use this defeat as a springboard towards even greater growth!"

"I am so grateful for your kind words to a defeated person like me, and I will do my utmost to make it up to you. I, Adalmann, would be willing to die for you, offering my withered body and broken bones."

Adalmann said that with tears in his eyes. I wish he would stop talking so much about unsettling things like 'breaking his bones' and 'offering his flesh and blood'. In fact, Adalmann had initially refused to accept when I told him that I was going to help him evolve.

<Rimuru-sama, unlike the rest of you, I am a defeated person. I cannot forgive myself. I am not sure that I, an incompetent person, could reach the same level of awakening as Rimuru-sama expects... I hope to be given the honor of reaching a higher level once I am given the next opportunity to make a difference!>

That was Adalmann's argument. I managed to convince him by persuading and quieting him down. To be honest, I didn't even expect too much from him in the first place. Even when Shinji and his group attacked up to the 60th floor, I had thought that Adalmann and his group would be defeated. But looking at them now, they have grown far beyond my expectations.

Krishna and the others were just a bad match for them this time. And so, I awarded the souls to Adalmann, with the hopes that he would work hard in moderation. This was a big deviation from the original plan, but the labyrinth would be the last line defense from now on. It was important to strengthen our defenses, so I asked Adalmann to evolve as well.

All of our important research facilities were located in the labyrinth, and if the time came, the capital could be isolated in the labyrinth. I had no idea how convenient this would eventually be when I first invited Ramiris. It was as if the labyrinth that we thought of as our playground had become a mighty fortress before we even realized it. All of this was thanks to Ramiris and Veldora. I called out to Adalmann, remembering to thank him as well.

"You lamented that your work was not good enough, but I still appreciate your work. Prove me right with your future endeavors!"

"Yes! I will surely live up to your expectations!"

Adalmann's evolution had begun. As it was in my case, he appeared to be suffering from an irresistible sleepiness. I felt bad to make him endure, so I quickly proceeded with the ritual.

![break]

"Yes, I believe you. Then, from this day forth, you shall take the name 'Gehenna Lord'. And you will live up to that name from now on!"

"Of course, by you will."

Whew! It's really exhausting using such dignified language. By the way, it was also hard to come up with all these titles. I didn't sleep all night. Granted, I had been idle with too much free time and didn't even need sleep, but...

Anyway, I decided to give Adalmann the title of a 'Lord', which was the highest rank amongst my subordinantes. There may be more of them in the future, but for now he was one of only twelve lords. As a powerful and influential executive, Adalmann's presence would surely increase. If he got the chance to do so, that is.

![break]

Adalmann was not the only one who played an active role. Albert was kneeling next to Adalmann, who was currently trying to resist sleep. Behind him, a death dragon was crouching down with its huge frame shrunken. Since gifts would be given to both of them, it was unlikely that I would have much time to talk with them. Albert would be given a weapon to replace his broken sword. He was already able to use the sword with an overwhelming skill-level, so it would be a great help to him if he was given the right equipment. Since that was the case, I thought that it would be better to give him Kurobee's masterpiece.

Amongst the spoils of war seized from the Imperial Army, there were legendary-grade weapons. Moreover, the grand general Calgurio had held a very rare mythical-grade weapon. This mythical-grade was too good to be displayed without being used. I tried to leave it to Kurobee, but Kurobee refused to accept it.

<I can now create mythical-grade weapons by myself!>

I was convinced that this was indeed true. Benimaru's 'Red Lotus' was reforged by Kurobee's hands to be as good as a mythical-grade. Convinced of this, I did not give him the weapon that I had now. In that case, who would be the right person to wield it? As one could see from Calgurio, merely being awakened did not make one a true master of a mythical-grade. Mythical-grade equipment will choose its own owner.

I understood that this was the case without analyzing it. I felt that mythical-grade equipment was a kind of 'tsukumogami'^[A Tsukumogami in Japanese folklore is basically a tool that has acquired a god/spirit. Sometimes it is used to describe items that have become alive and self-aware.]. The magical steel had evolved into hihiirokane over a long period of time, and so, the owner had to be worthy of it to be able to wield it. This was exactly the kind of thing that a person with a long lifespan could only dream of. A noble soul that had become a dead spirit and was exposed to endless hardships, but nevertheless did not lose his skill-level as a Paladin. He had then evolved into a 'death paladin' with an endless lifespan. Albert had studied hard and gained sword skills comparable to Hakurou's. Wouldn't he be the perfect person to handle this equipment?

That's what I thought. Besides, all the other executives had their own favorite weapons. There are even those who had a trusting relationship with Kurobee, and they did not want to carry any other weapons but those made by Kurobee. Others, like Diablo and the Three demon girls, used their own 'Matter Creation' skill to make their weapons into tangible objects. The performance of those weapons were proportional to the skill-level of the owner, and they had at least legendary-grade defense. There was no need for them to own existing armor. Some, like Shion, had constantly poured mana into their weapons with love and affection for a long time. Perhaps because of this, Shion's favorite sword have become 'Hercules Ex', a legendary-grade weapon that prioritized destructive power. That said, didn't that weapon break?

I thought it was cut in half during the fight with Razul, but now it was back together again. That right, just like its owner Shion herself, even her beloved sword was revived like a phoenix. I was more stunned than surprised. And I was also a little scared. Shion seemed to have a love for cooking, but...what kind of ingredient is that?! Shion said that her so-called love had such an effect that it could revive even a broken sword. Just thinking about a dish infused with that kind of love...

I had a dangerous feeling that I was going to have to think more about this in future, but I decided to just return to the task at hand. Now that I knew that compatibility with the equipment is also an important factor, there was no need to give the other subordinates new weapons now. This alone was a good enough reason, but the final push came from Wisdom King Raphael-san. It assured me that Albert was the best person to give this mythical-grade weapon to. I nodded my head without any doubts and decided to give it to Albert as a reward. Thus, Albert's prize was a set of mythical-grade equipment. It was full-plate armor, including a longsword and a kite shield.

"Albert, your swordsmanship is excellent. In recognition of your skill, I will give you these. Keep up the good work and help Adalmann!"

"As you wish!"

At the same time I called out to him, Shuna pushed a wagon with a set of equipment in front of him. She handed it to Albert. Albert shivered nervously as soon as he saw it.

"Th-This is..."

Albert was astonished, probably because he noticed its performance at first glance. It was no wonder. It was one of the few remaining pieces remaining in existence which had been handed down from mythical times. It was the highest honor for a knight to handle the best armor in the world.

"You'll be able to use it, won't you?"

I won't let you say no. Under the pressure of my gaze, Albert became fired up.

"Of course! I will surely live up to the expectations of Rimuru-sama!"

Albert replied in high spirits. He seemed to be full of enthusiasm, and I felt relieved. Then, as soon as Albert touched it, the mythical-grade equipment wrapped itself around Albert's body naturally. He seemed to have been recognized as the master of the armor. There was only one miscalculation. The performance of the mythical-grade equipment, now freed by its true master, was far beyond what I had expected. Albert had become as good as an incarnated spiritual organism whenever he was equipped with the mythical-grade equipment.

The ability to temporarily transform a physical person into a spiritual life form---this was the true power hidden within mythical-grade equipment. A spiritual life-form was, so to speak, a god-like existence with no lifespan. Veldora is like that, and I am like that, so to speak. There was nothing tangible about it, but it was definitely like immortality. Immortality is definite, and its nature is quite inexorable. Aside from conditions such as the destruction of the heart core or loss of magicules, it felt as if there was no way someone like that could die.

In other words, a spiritual life form had no life span, was unaffected by any abnormalities, and could overcome death with just the power of will. I was convinced that mythical-grade equipment had a tremendous performance because it could raise someone to the same level as such a supernatural being, even if only temporarily. At the same time, I could understand the reason why Wisdom King Raphael-san had recommended Albert. Benimaru had evolved into a spiritual life form on his own, and Ranga and Shion were similar...no, rather, I was pretty sure that they would be similar. Gabil and Geld were not quite there yet, but I think that giving them mythical-grade equipment would not change their current conditions. Certainly, Albert was the right choice. It was like a match made in heaven, that's how I felt.

![break]

Adalmann's pet dragon couldn't be forgotten either. Because the death dragon had been working so hard, I decided that I would reward it in some way. I was wondering what I should do, but now I had thought of an answer. A name. 'Naming' is the best way to make a monster happy. It is a dangerous thing to do, but now I had Wisdom King Raphael-san with me. I'm sure it would keep things safe and adjust the outflow of magicules.

![break]

<<Proposal. In this case, there is already a bond between the individual Adalmann and the death dragon. Rather than creating a 'Soul Corridor', it is recommended to use the method of 'Naming' by consumption of souls.>>

![break]

Hmm? This was an unexpected suggestion from Wisdom King Raphael-san. By the way, how much soul is consumed in this case?

![break]

<<Answer. 5,000. Do you want to do it?

YES/NO>>

![break]

If it's only 5,000, then that is much more secure and reliable. Wisdom King Raphael-san said that it had analyzed the souls of 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' to convert them into magicules. It assured me that I would be safe. Okay, then let's go with that! I stood in front of the death dragon and patted its head. It seemed quite nervous, and although it looked quite scary, it was actually quite a cute guy.

"I must reward you as well. So, from now on, you are Wenti, the 'Hell Dragon King'!"

After saying that, I consumed the souls and Named it. In that moment, a dramatic change occurred. The death dragon's huge frame of more than 20 meters became smaller and smaller until it transformed into a beautiful woman wearing a dark-colored robe.

![full page image](image3)

I wondered what this was, but I still wasn't letting my guard down. I guess with monsters, all things are possible. I've been there and I've learned a lot. The truths I have learned thus far kept me from panicking in the moment. I maintained my unwavering attitude of 'of course this is what should happen', without showing my panic. I'm still trying very hard.

"Oh, my beautiful, beloved god! I am so moved by your blessings given even to my lowly self!"

Uh, yeah. Of course I knew she could speak fluently. And all I've given her is a name. Well, there was also the gift from Adalmann. I think she seems to be misunderstanding. I hope she doesn't get the wrong idea.

"O-oh, good for you, Death---no, Wenti!"

"Ahhh, my master. God has not forsaken me!"

"Yes, this is the result of our faith."

"Yes!"

What a beautiful love between lord and slave. It feels like I'm being left on the sidelines, but I'm happy for them. Thus, the reward ritual given to Adalmann and the others was successfully completed.

![break]

Even so, 'Naming' by consuming souls is very convenient. Originally, if I tried naming upper class monsters of the dragon lord class, I didn't know how many magicules I would lose. Even with Wisdom King Raphael-san, there was a limit to the amount of magicules I had. All of the magicules I had been accumulating through 'Gluttonous King Beelzebuth' had been used up by naming Testarossa and others. There was the method of relying on Veldora, but he seemed to be very reluctant to do so. It was hard to get him to change his mind, so I decided that would be a last resort.

Naming without any reserves can be a problem if it makes me fall into a low-level active state (sleep mode). Now that my total amount of magicules had increased, I didn't know how much time it would take me to recover. This was wartime. It would have normally been impossible to take such a risky bet. However, it was not a problem this time. Earlier, I had been wondering how I should thank Ramiris, but if I did this, I think she would be happy about it, right?

Basically, I came up with the idea of giving names to the four dragon lords under Ramiris. Even if they had no connection with me, they could still be named in this way. It was thanks to Wisdom King Raphael for coming up with this idea. I had enough souls in my possession, so there should be more than 20,000 souls left. In the first place, I was only able to secure such a large number of souls thanks to the cooperation of Ramiris.

But Ramiris had told me, "I have no use for souls, so I don't need them," and she gave them all to me. I still felt bad about that, so this seemed to be a good idea. I hope she will be pleased with it. I would remember to talk to her later.

![soft scene break]

And just like that, the ceremony of the labyrinth group had come to an end. The celebration was now at its final stage, and only two problem children remained. Needless to say, they were the first and second secretaries---Shion and Diablo. From what I had seen so far, I was convinced that there was no danger of them storming out. However, I still had to be on guard. After all, this was Shion and Diablo we're talking about. It was not an understatement to say that they were the two most dangerous. If both of them began rampaging at the same time, the damage would be enormous. And currently, the leaders were not in a reliable state. For these reasons, I would start with Shion.

"Shion, you are appointed as the 'War Lord'. Hopefully from today onwards, you will act with more composure than ever before."

"Of course! There is no woman in the world as calm and mature as me!"

Uh, that, just who are you talking about? You seem to be talking about yourself, but your self-esteem is way too high! I was impressed that Shion had learned to control herself recently, but she still had a long way to go. I should keep an eye on her for the long haul.

"I'll take it as is, so don't lose control. Consult closely with those around you, and protect us all!"

After I said that, I gave Shion the souls.

---And then, huh? To my surprise, there was no change at all. Shion looked at me with a puzzled look on her face. We stared at each other for a while, but there was still no sign of change. Was it a dud? This made me feel like I wasn't rewarding her, and it was becoming very awkward. I was suddenly in a crisis.

After all, I had nothing else prepared. I wondered what to do, but then a surprising phenomenon occurred. The Yomigaeri fell asleep, while Shion did not change at all. And among the members of the mysterious Shion fan club there were a few who seemed to be having a hard time staying awake. It appeared that all of them were given some kind of gift, though it differed depending on the individual. Shion herself seemed to be fine, but that in itself was strange. There was no point in thinking about it too deeply, right? I guess this kind of thing just happened because they were direct subordinates of Shion. For this reason, it seemed better to leave this whole Shion ordeal alone.

"Well then, Shion, if you feel something is wrong with your body, please let me know."

"Yes! By the way, Rimuru-sama, I too, like Gobta, would like a special right..."

Shion began saying something like that, fidgeting. Well, yeah. The ritual was done properly, but it felt to me that this was nothing more than giving a title. Some would say it is enough, but in Shion's case, she didn't need a new weapon...

Like Gobta, huh?

"Okay. In that case, let's teach you how to make a special dish!"

"What? So you agree that I am a better cook than Shuna-sama..."

"Absolutely not!"

How on earth can someone come to such an impossible conclusion? Shuna, who had been listening beside me, was aghast, but then she suddenly got into a good mood when I immediately denied it. Shion seemed to be dissatisfied with my denial, but when I whispered to her that I would expand the kitchen as well, she nodded her head in satisfaction and went back to the line. She was an easy gal to deal with.

However, Shion's subordinates, the Yomigaeri, had evolved in an interesting way. They had become some type of spiritual life form. It was interesting to note that unlike a demon, the Yomigaeri all had their own bodies. They had physical bodies, but they were similar to the demon race. More importantly, they had not lost the ability to mate. They had been reborn into a completely new species. In other words, they were something like a new race of death oni. It seems that the oni factor of Shion manifested more strongly, and their power greatly increased. Some of them had even acquired the Extra Skill 'Divine Force', which was a physical enhancement system. However, they did not have horns.

Although their magicule count was lower than that of the Hiryuu, it was difficult to judge which of the two was stronger considering their immortality. No one would believe me if I told them that these guys were once hobgoblins. Indeed, monsters have such a mysterious biology. Shion's ritual ended in this way, though it was surprising that she did not change.

Well, it was finally the turn of the last person. Problematic Diablo. He had been fidgeting with impatience for a long time now.

*'Is it my turn now? How about now?'*---his smile had been giving off that feeling, as if in anticipation. To be honest, it was more likely for Diablo to go on a rampage if the ceremony was canceled rather than losing control after awakening. I could say with certainty that if anybody interrupted this, their lives would be lost. All right then, let's get started.

"Diablo-kun."

"Yes, Rimuru-sama!"

I have a bad feeling about this. Without a doubt, this evolution would make him one of the strongest in the monster country. Not only would he be the most powerful among my subordinates, but he'd definitely be more powerful than me. He had mentioned himself that he couldn't beat Zegion, but he had probably been bound by certain conditions. The proof was that he had single-handedly conquered Jiwu and Bernie, who were quite strong opponents themselves. As powerful as Zegion was, Diablo gave off the impression of being the most superior. In other words, Diablo was still the strongest among my subordinates. If Diablo was really serious, he could probably be stronger than me even as it is now. In fact, the person I was when I first awakened was simply no match for the person I am now...

It would be interesting to see how Diablo would evolve.

"You are deserving of the title 'Magic Lord'. I hope you will continue to lead the demons as my sword in the future as well!"

Especially those three demon girls.

"Kufufufu, leave it to me, Rimuru-sama!"

Please, I'm serious. I nodded and then performed the ritual on Diablo.

![break]

---And then the devil was born.

![break]

In an instant, the evolution appeared to be over. I thought it was a dud like with Shion, but it turned out that wasn't the case. It was just that he had controlled all of the energy perfectly and did not show it at all. As expected of Diablo---he was brilliant. Diablo had evolved and become one of the most powerful beings on earth. A portion of his power also flowed through the newly created Soul Corridor.

This is bad, this is really bad. I can't even begin to imagine the upper limit of his power. Now that Benimaru and Shion had yet to evolve, he had become the most powerful being under my control. No, on the contrary...

He was on par with myself in terms of total magicule count, and considering his accumulated skill-level and experience, it felt like I was no longer a match for him. Sure enough, my bad premonition seemed to be coming true. That said, I had a feeling things would turn out this way, so I was not at all upset.

"Excellent evolution, Diablo."

"It is a great honor to receive your compliments, Rimuru-sama."

So that's it, huh? His personality was the same as before. It would have been interesting to see if he had wanted to overcome the situation here. If that had happened, I was planning to fight seriously, though that was a secret of course. Diablo, however, appeared to be trying to get a new Skill, even though his evolution was complete.

"What are you doing?"

"No, it's just that I realized the usefulness of an Ultimate Skill in the last battle. I had ignored this power in the past because Guy kept bragging about it, but now I've changed my mind and have decided to use whatever I can."

"O-oh, I see..."

Is this guy an idiot? This is called being a smartass, right? There seem to be a lot of that type hanging around me.

"I'm going to take this opportunity to learn it so that I can brag about it the next time I see him. Kufufufu."

"A-ahhh."

He hates Guy bragging about it, but doesn't mind doing it himself...?

Well, whatever. One only has to look at Diablo's attitude up until now to understand that he'll be selfish towards anyone but me. Even I could understand that without relying on Wisdom King Raphael-san. Anyway, I won't have to worry about it, since Guy would be the victim. As long as I don't get involved in it, I can turn a blind eye. Diablo has maintained the same attitude as before, and at this rate, it seems that my worries about him were unfounded. He has completely controlled the evolution, and I would continue to rely on him as a competent subordinate.

Incidentally, there was another fact that would later come to light. An evolutionary gift from Diablo was given to Venom, his second-in-command, along with a hundred demons under his command. However, though this was only my intuition, I had a suspicion that Diablo focused his energy on the gifts. I didn't know if such a thing was possible or not, but I wouldn't be surprised if Diablo could do it. Diablo would have thought that strength is not something that is given, but something that is acquired by oneself. But then again, Venom also seemed to have something to offer. He had evolved properly and become a demon peer.

That said, he was not as good as Testarossa nor was he as intimidating as Moss and Veyron. It would not be reasonable for a person who had reigned as the strongest for a long time to be defeated by a newcomer, right? Even though they were the same class of demon peers, the difference in 'status' was quite apparent.

*"That's for sure. I'm just a newcomer, and I haven't even lived a hundred years. I'm not even worth being compared to them."* Venom himself had said as such.

Venom appeared to be a special individual, belonging to a late modern species with little experience. There was a chance he was a reincarnated person with a strange fate, since he was born with a Unique Skill. He has no memory of his previous life, but sometimes he remembers words that he should not know. He had said that he often felt a sense of déjà vu whenever he saw things having to do with Japan. Well, if he really was a 'reincarnated person', it made sense that he was special.

That said, Venom knew his place. He did not get carried away nor did he look down on his colleagues even if he had evolved to the same level as Testarossa and her colleagues. He seemed to have realized the difference in his abilities after observing his evolved power. For a demon, experience was more important than the amount of magicules. While I was in the midst of thinking that this kid was pretty good, he told me a story.

*"Well, actually, I challenged Diablo-sama before, and now I've been taught the true difference between our abilities ever since!"*

He said this in such a cheerful way, but he's just an idiot, isn't he? This kind of thing is typical among Diablo's inner circle, so it seems that there was a reason he liked him. But even so, it turned out to be a good thing. He learned from his experience and wouldn't make the same mistake again. Even if he ever did get carried away, Diablo would definitely take care of it. Diablo had no mercy on those who did not know their place, even if it was those under his command. Venom seemed to be a man who could learn from his mistakes.

![break]

And then there were the others who received gifts. In fact, these guys were originally still in the process of constructing their bodies in the culture capsules. One hundred such bodies were born as devil chevaliers. Devil chevaliers were those who had gained power comparable to that of greater majins, though not as powerful as archdemons. They had become so fierce that they could slaughter greater demons with a single blow.

To put it simply, they were a super high-spec existence, yet Diablo was not interested in them in the slightest. He left all of them as Venom's subordinates. He gave priority to being able to move freely in protecting his position under my direct control. It was at that moment that I was convinced that he had not changed after all. Diablo was still Diablo, even if he had evolved and surpassed me.

![soft scene break]

And so ended the evolutionary rituals of the executives. I was glad that things ended peacefully. However, the victory party was still going on. I called out to those who had done well, and congratulated them for their efforts. And so things continued until only those who were sober were celebrating. The all-inclusive banquet would be held the next time. While looking forward to that time, I would enjoy today's feast.

Unfortunately, Jaine-san and the two members of the 'Two Wings' had left. They told me with apologetic faces that they had some urgent business to attend to and had to hurry back as soon as the ceremony was over. I hope that they will take their time to join in the celebration next time. I was also worried about those who were getting drunk at the party.

"---I'm not a good match for Benimaru-sama anyway. I knew that from the beginning!"

"Gobua-dono, you are beautiful too. Just look at me, I was killed by Alvis-sama, my idol. Beastmen are those who like the strong. They want someone who's as good as or better than themselves as a mate. And if someone is strong, he can have as many women as he wants. That's how it is supposed to be, yet I..."

"Phobio-dono, you are already strong enough. If I were stronger, I would have been able to get between those two---"

"You may just call me Phobio. You are also strong enough. It's just, you know, it's the wrong comparison. I can't beat them either, so there's nothing to do about it."

"Phobio-dono...no, Phobio. In that case, please just call me Gobua."

"Ahhh, Gobua."

"Phobio..."

Hey, hey, hey, I can't watch this anymore! Look, I'm an adult, so I won't get angry, but this is not the place for you guys to have a lovey-dovey date! That said, I guess it's not a bad thing if two rejected people hit it off with each other. Love really is a mysterious thing. I decided to take things as is. And so, the party continued in full swing, and the night passed happily...

Thus, new 'lords' were born in our country. Although they could not call themselves demon lords according to the regulations, nine of them were in fact equivalent to awakened demon lords. In addition, there were three 'primordials'. Unless something unexpected happens, we should be able to cope with any unexpected situation. Since I have given the title of 'lord' to these twelve, I will call them collectively 'Twelve Chaos Guardian Lords'. Although some of them also had titles such as the 'Four Heavenly Kings' or the 'Elite Ten', the official title of 'Lord' takes precedence over them. This is because, unlike the other positions, there was no plan to replace its members.

In effect, a 'Lord' is a permanent executive since they transcend life span. In the future, it would be ideal for them to be separated from the day-to-day management and to be active only in wartime or in emergency situations. Rigurd and Rigur, as well as Gobta and Myourmiles, and a number of others, were excellent executives, but they had their own life expectancy. There was still a need to consider generational subordinates and the permanent subordinates differently. It was not an immediate issue, but it would be an issue to be discussed in the future. The one I was concerned about was Gobta.

He was still a top executive, and he was surprisingly resourceful and strong in battle. To be honest, his 'Magic Wolf Unification' with Ranga was a cheat move. Ranga would become stronger after this evolution, but I was sure Gobta would be able to handle it. Gobta really was a special kind of being. The evolution from naming him had not changed his appearance. What he said in his sleep about evolution through talent might even hold some weight. And with his reward, Gobta's position had officially been established. Gobta's position of being closer to me than other executives had brought him much attention. Perhaps by accident, it was the best reward of all. I thought this as I looked at my friends who were all enjoying the banquet.

On another note. Apparently, after the world heard about the events of that day, I became known as 'Chaos Creator' Rimuru. Because I was conscious of the many things I had done, I decided to accept this new nickname.
