# Interlude 1: The Outrageous|Victory|Celebration

Jaine attended the celebration and witnessed the shocking spectacle. Demon Lord Rimuru had evolved his majin followers one by one, turning them into 'True Demon Lords'.

*Oh no, this...this can't be! I'm not dreaming, am I?*

Jaine was so surprised she couldn't even make a sound. She knew that Demon Lord Rimuru was trouble, but this was so ridiculous and unrealistic that it was far worse than the worst Jaine could have imagined. Jaine's purpose in coming here had been to ask Rimuru how he was going to handle the 'primordials'. Jaine herself believed in Rimuru. But a 'primordial' was not an existence that could just be taken easily. Once unleashed, they could disrupt the balance of power in the world.

And in fact, this war had proven just that. The elites of the Imperial Army, 940,000 of them, were annihilated without a trace. It was fortuitous that Rimuru was on their side, but there was no guarantee that they would be able to maintain that relationship for a long time to come. Therefore, Jaine came here as a representative, to check on the situation and to see how things were going. Rimuru's reaction when she greeted him was natural and he did not seem to have changed since their previous meeting.

Jaine then complained a little harshly. She intended to find out what Rimuru was thinking by observing how he reacted to her complaints. The result was a flop. In response to Jaine's anger, Rimuru not only showed his remorseful attitude, he even honestly apologized, saying "I'm sorry." Then, Rimuru's explanation of the situation, which could only be called an excuse, revealed that it was Diablo who had done this all on his own.

"Is this Diablo the same as the Black Primordial (Noir)?"

"Uh, it seems so. I didn't know that either, but I don't know why he's so close to me..."

After saying that, Rimuru nodded his head in baffled agreement. It didn't look like he was lying, and she could only understand that he had decided to take in the demons without knowing what they were. Jaine's life experience was also telling her that this was not an act. If so, there was nothing more Rimuru could do, even if she complained further. More importantly, Rimuru himself was not at fault. There had been a fear that he might become arrogant with his power, but Jaine was relieved to find out that she had worried too much. This was not good. At that time, she should have given him more of a stern warning.

*Even if the Primordials becoming his followers was a force majeure, it's just plain malicious to mass-produce 'True Demon Lords'!*

No, most likely, Rimuru truly had no malicious intent. Perhaps he was convinced that he could handle any problems on his own if something came up, just did not intend to cause trouble for Jaine and the others. Normally, such an approach would make one suspect a threat, but he must have had no intention to do so. Perhaps, he might have even decided that he could not hide anything more since he had been so much criticized for the 'primordial' situation. The disclosure of information was made with sincerity and based on trust. If so, Jaine was also partly to blame. She should have taught Rimuru some common sense earlier. Whether that was possible or not, it was too late now.

*This world...the balance of power in this world is...*

Jaine almost fainted as she thought about what would happen next. The celebration went on without incident, and one by one, his subordinates were gaining strength. A systematic influx of power was observed in them. There was no doubt that Tempest's strength had increased significantly in just the past few hours. A huge military state was about to be born in the center of the Great Jura Forest, far beyond the threat of the Empire of the East. Realizing this, Jaine regretted having not dealt with this problem earlier. However, even if she had those thoughts...

*There's nothing we can do. Even last time, the conclusion was that 'There is nothing we can do, so there is no point in thinking about it.' King Gazel also decided to put this matter on hold, but there will be no solution in the future. In that case...*

The war with the Empire was not yet over. The Imperial Army was still deployed, and Rimuru had been in contact with them. The next plan was to conspire to attack the capital of the Empire at once. Jaine had come here in the first place for the purpose of arranging such a meeting. And yet...

*I've never been so confused in my life. At this point, they're not even an Empire anymore. I must tell King Gazel that the True Demon Lord has been born!*

For a moment, Jaine thought about pretending she hadn't noticed. It would be an escape from reality, but it also seemed like a good idea. However, she was the one who had pressed King Gazel a while ago as to why he had not told her about the 'primordials'. Therefore, Jaine had no right to remain silent.

"Dolph, I'm going back first."

"No, why? The main purpose of coming, the meeting, is scheduled for tomorrow, isn't it?"

"We would still save face if just you were to attend. I will return home by magic. I don't need an escort."

"O-okay..."

Dolph, who was unable to read the flow of mana, did not understand what had just happened in front of him. Jaine was a little envious of Dolph and felt depressed just thinking about the future.

![hard scene break]

The 'Two Wings' duo, Lucia with blonde hair and Claire with silver hair, were in a state of intense agitation under their mask-like expressions. Tempest, the land of monsters, was home to many powerful majins. They knew that, and had been in contact with some of them, Geld being the first. While acknowledging them as a threat, they were currently allies, so they did not believe there was a need to be so cautious. No matter how many greater majins there were, they could still match up. That's how they felt until now.

What they had been ordered to do was to assess Tempest's strength. Now that they were at war with the Nasca Namrium Ulmeria United Eastern Empire, the largest and most powerful of the human nations, Rimuru's forces would probably suffer some damage. If this happened, then the construction of the sky city, which Frey was looking forward to, would be hampered. It was their mission to assess the damage and make predictions for the future. Naturally, this included the organization of reinforcements. However, it appeared that this was not necessary.

"Zero casualties?"

"I can't believe it, but seeing your cheerful faces, I guess it's true."

As a result, an unexpected report was given. They had been glad to hear the news and joined in the victory party, but it was a huge miscalculation being shown an event that took them by surprise on the spot.

<That's impossible. It is impossible that some of the executives have grown up to be as fierce as Frey-sama in such a short period of time...>

<No, look over there...Demon Lord Rimuru is about to do something.>

Claire calmly pointed out to Lucia, who was upset to see those who had come up to the podium. What began next was the most appalling ritual that the two could have ever imagined. No, this was not the time to be dumbfounded. It was unrealistic to the point of wanting to give up thinking about it, but this was too serious a situation for them to make any judgments.

<We have to report this to Frey-sama ASAP!>

<Yes, that's right. Let's go home right away.>

They communicated and quickly made a decision. And so they returned to report to Frey what had happened.

.........

......

...

The location was the topmost floor of the temporary castle, in a corner of the keep which had not fully been furnished. Frey let out a long sigh.

"What in the world is that slime thinking?"

One person responded to her mutterings.

"Hey, hey, what's going on? Your melancholy expression is beautiful, but a sigh doesn't suit you, does it?"

It was Karion. The two were now well acquainted with each other as Milim's assistants.

"I wouldn't be so sure."

"What really happened? Are we fighting an uphill battle against the Imperial Army?" Karion asked anxiously. Frey looked worried as she answered.

"That would have been better. Then we wouldn't have to worry about things and we could just send reinforcements right away."

"Well, then, what is it? Did that Rimuru guy do something terrible again?"

"---Correct."

After a moment of silence, Frey collected her thoughts and answered. Karion remained silent.

"Karion, may I ask you something?"

"What is it?"

"Calling Rimuru-sama, Milim-sama's best friend, 'that Rimuru guy', is not very nice."

"Oh, come on, it's a little too late for that. Besides, you called that kid by his first name when you were with Milim, and you even called him 'that slime' not too long ago!"

"Did you hear me? You're a bad person too. I won't say it in front of other people, so forget about that."

"That's fine, but don't try to cover things up with a story. Just tell me what's going on."

Again, Frey let out a helpless sigh. Her fragrant breath tickled Karion's nostrils. Karion, who was pleased by this, looked at Frey with an expression saying that he was not going to be fooled.

"All right, all right. You won't be sorry you asked, will you?"

"Depends on what it is."

"You..."

"I won't regret it. Don't take it all on yourself. Let me shoulder some of the burden too."

"That's fine. I like that about you."

Frey felt her melancholy mood lift and she smiled. Then she told Karion a portion of the report she had received from the twins.

"Seriously?"

"I'm serious. It's impossible for those girls to lie to me."

"Well, then, what is it? Seven demon lords were just born under Rimuru?!"

"That seems to be the case."

"So are those guys stronger than us?"

"I don't know. But...at the very least, they felt stronger than I am in the eyes of those girls."

Before they evolved, they seemed to be as strong as Frey. But Demon Lord Rimuru had now done 'something' to them, and the girls had sensed an overwhelming increase in their power. According to the report, some of them were still in the middle of their evolution, but it would not be long before their power would stabilize. The contents of the report were unacceptable, but that seemed acceptable.

"...Are you kidding me?"

Even Karion, who heard the story from Frey, was speechless.

"Karion, do I look like I'm joking?"

"Not at all."

"Right, those are the facts."

Karion and Frey had never shown their full strength in front of their subordinates. However, even close subordinates could see the power of their masters to a certain extent. Even if it was only an estimate, it was information that could not be ignored. Moreover, there was no one under Frey who would ever offend her by making jokes or telling lies. Knowing this, Karion had no choice but to believe what he just heard.

*Just what the hell were Phobio and Alvis doing...?*

However, Phobio was not originally a man who could recognize his opponent's strength. Even if something unusual had happened in front of his eyes, he would not have noticed it.

*---No, Alvis would have seen it. So then why didn't she report this to me?*

While Karion was wondering about this, Frey told him something as if she had forgotten about it.

"Oh, by the way, Alvis-san, the leader of your group, is now engaged to Benimaru-dono, who is in charge of Rimuru-sama's group. If this international marriage succeeds, then it will contribute to the relationship between our two countries. Rimuru-sama has also approved it. I'm very happy for them."

"She did it!"

Alvis had approached Karion about this earlier. The advice he gave her was to 'take it by force'. As a result, Alvis had won her prize. Karion grinned with pleasure.

"But it looks like she's going to be the second wife."

"Che, I thought she would be the first. Still, once she has a baby, it will be for our people."

"That's vulgar."

"Don't worry, Frey, you're the only woman I've ever loved."

"Don't be silly. My race is monogamous. We're the opposite of you, so it's not gonna work."

The harpies were an almost exclusively female species that relied on the rare occurrence of a male form or the acceptance of powerful majin nymphs for diversity to sustain their race. For queens such as Frey, it was common practice to increase the number of her offspring by monogenesis. A husband was not a necessity. On the other hand, among the beastmen, it was common for a strong man to love more than one woman. The weak were weeded out, and the race became stronger. Both sides had the same purpose, however, they were not compatible with each other by any stretch of the imagination. That said, both Karion and Frey recognized each other's strength. Therefore, they maintained a dangerous relationship, like walking on a tightrope, tightly holding the last line of defense.

"Well, I can't seem to get a good answer from you for now, so I'll let this continue slowly. The real question is, what did that Rimuru guy do now?"

Putting the Alvis celebration on the back burner, Karion got down to business. Frey agreed with this sentiment. Although we have a good relationship with Rimuru and the others now, and we intend to maintain it, no one can be sure of the future. I wanted to know what happened, and if possible, find a way to achieve a higher level of success.

"Clayman's ending comes to mind. He had been in a state of extraordinary power at that time."

"According to Rimuru, that was an awakening."

"What do you think caused it?"

"Hmph! It didn't look like that guy had any hidden power. That means he must have gotten his power in that moment."

"How?"

"That's..."

"Souls."

"Hmm?"

"...Clayman said, 'By collecting souls, I will awaken as a 'True Demon Lord'. If this is true, there's no way that Clayman wouldn't have collected souls beforehand."

"I see. So he used them to try to awaken."

"I think so. To be honest, I haven't killed many humans, so I've never cared much about souls."

"Me too. Wars are fought with our own kind, other majin, or angels. Our country was wealthy, so we didn't care about the humans."

"Indeed. But this does answer the question. Rimuru-sama apparently gained a lot of souls in this war. He must have given them to the majin under his control to awaken them."

"That's an exaggeration. As much as I hate the fact that a bunch of majin who became 'Demon Lord Seeds' like us are under his control, I'm more pissed off that they beat us to it. In that case, how many souls did Rimuru use?"

Karion scratched his head and asked, and Frey turned her attention to the city under construction below.

"Hello?"

"Oh, by the way, I didn't mention the outcome of the war. Surprisingly, Tempest's army suffered zero damage. On the other side, the Empire lost 940,000 of their own people."

"...Huh?"

"Do you think I'm lying?"

"N-no, but..."

"I also hoped that this report had been wrong."

In other words, Demon Lord Rimuru had obtained as many as 940,000 souls, so it would have been easy for him to awaken his seven subordinates. There was also the possibility that it was not just those seven who were awakened. According to the report, Benimaru, who was the general, did not show any changes, but only married two wives, Momiji and Alvis. However, there was no way Rimuru would not have given souls to Benimaru, his right hand man. It would be safer to assume that the evolution of Benimaru had been delayed for some reason.

"Okay, a one-sided victory with zero casualties. That's not even a war anymore. I would have raised the white flag long ago, but I wonder how the Empire will act."

"Don't be ridiculous. I don't care about the Empire. The real question is, what should we do now?"

"Exactly. I'm just surrendering to Milim. I was afraid that asking for power might make her suspect treason, but now I've been reminded that I don't need to worry about that!"

"What do you mean?"

"Rimuru brought his subordinates up to the same level as himself, right? Seeing him that way, I realized that Milim must be the same way."

"Indeed. Milim is not such a small being that she would make a fuss over our own awakenings."

"Right? Then why don't we just do as we please? We've been a little too relaxed, but it's not too late. Let's aim for even higher things!"

"Yes, you're right. I like that about you."

Frey and Karion looked at each other. The atmosphere had just gotten pretty good, when---

"Wahahaha! Well said, guys! I may not be able to awaken my minions like Rimuru can, but I can train them! In the labyrinth, you won't have to worry about dying, so we can do this with all our might!"

Milim intervened at the perfect moment.

![full page image](image4)

"Che, you're in the---Ah Milim! You're in the way just when the mood was getting good."

"I've told you many times before, but don't remove your aura to sneak up on me. That said, I have no intention to accompany you for your training---"

Karion and Frey complained, but Milim did not listen to them. Milim's ears had an excellent function of shutting out any information that might be inconvenient.

"All right then, I'll go ask Ramiris for help!"

"W-Wait, wait! I didn't ask you to train me either!!"

"Milim! If you won't listen to me, I'll think of my own idea. I will leave all of your meals up to Midley-dono. Is that all right with you?"

Frey's comment stimulated Milim's sense of crisis and succeeded in stopping her. Karion, who was watching the event, praised Frey.

"I-I get it. If you want to train, you can call me anytime."

"That's fine. By the way, did you finish your homework?"

"W-Well, you know, I heard something interesting, so..."

"You haven't done it yet, have you?"

Frey smiled.

"Ugh, now that the break is over, I'll go right back."

"Yes, that's a good girl."

Milim returned to her homework, and Frey and Karion also succeeded in overcoming the crisis. However, their ambition for evolution continued to smolder in their hearts. Whether or not this ambition would ever be fulfilled was a question that remained to be answered.
