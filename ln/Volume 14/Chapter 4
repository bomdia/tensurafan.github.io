# Chapter 4: The Purge of|the Red Lotus

The Eastern city of the Armed Nation of Dwargon was now blockaded by 60,000 men. However, that was just a cover-up. Both sides had made it known behind the scenes that they were allied with each other. The commanders were worried about the possibility of an unfortunate accident. In such a situation, the air of the soldiers at the end of the line was light. Tents were set up for encampment, and chit-chat bloomed in the tents. Even so, everyone maintained a moderate sense of tension. Every single soldier was in the same state of mind, so it could be said that the training level of the soldiers was remarkably high. No wonder their morale was so high.

After all, their superiors were in the midst of their final meeting. Their dreams of overthrowing the Empire and establishing a new nation would be decided at that meeting. Everyone was looking forward to it, and everyone's eyes were filled with expectation toward the capital. That is why so many people noticed at the same time.

"So red, huh?"

"Is the capital on fire?"

"What happened? No, did they find out our plan?!"

Something was happening in the capital on this important day. No one thought this was a coincidence. Everyone there realized that something had happened to the executives.

"Should we send out a scouting party?"

"No, it's better to be organized."

"You idiot! If we do that, our treachery will be completely exposed!"

The absence of a superior meant that there was no one to command. The Mixed Corps, which was originally ridiculed as a hodgepodge, had become unmanageable all at once. A big man, who had kept his eyes closed until then, threatened them. His name was Zero. He was the man Yuuki had assigned as the deputy corps commander, and he was the supreme commander of the corps at this moment.

"Quiet! I will not tolerate arbitrary action. We will stay here and wait for Yuuki-sama and the others to arrive. There will be no change to that policy."

Zero's assurance of this calmed down those who had been divided. Since they did not know what the right answer was, they decided to follow the orders of their superiors. Even so, however, their uneasiness did not disappear...

Their fears came true in the worst possible way.

"Good evening, you fools. Just because it's a nice night, doesn't mean you should get too excited."

Leisurely. As easy as taking a walk. The woman came down the street. A very beautiful woman with blue hair, it was none other than Velgrynd.

"W-who are you?"

Soldiers on the outer edge of the roadside made a commotion and looked at Velgrynd. It was no ordinary person who would address an encamped army. Even before that, anyone who was unaware of Velgrynd's unusual presence could not have survived in the Mixed Corps. At the same time as confirming the identity of Velgrynd, a message was also sent to the superiors. Soldiers moved to surround Velgrynd. In the midst of all this, a man who was confident in his abilities stepped forward.

"Hey, woman, I don't know who you are, but you'd better not pick a fight with this many people. We may look like this, but we're the Mixed Corps, the most powerful---"

"It's funny that the weak claim to be the strongest, isn't it? I would have tolerated it if it had boosted morale, but I think it would be better not to allow it at the corps level."

"What?"

Velgrynd's words were those of an overwhelmingly superior person. A being who could give orders to an organization called an army from the top. Even the smallest soldier could see that this was a dangerous being. Naturally, Zero, the deputy corps commander, was also aware of the situation. When Zero heard that the other party was alone, he moved to confirm its identity with his own eyes. Upon hearing the report, he rushed to the site. Then, he saw Velgrynd.

"I'm sorry, Lord Marshal..."

Even Zero had never seen the Marshal's face. However, the atmosphere was unmistakably the same as that of the being that always radiated an overwhelming presence on the other side of the curtain.

"Oh, so some of you are a little smart. Good. I've been told not to kill you all. I'll play with you until Kondou and the others arrive."

With these words, the tragedy began.

![hard scene break]

Gazel was living each day with anxiety. The war was still going on, and that alone was a headache. But it was more than that. Upon hearing Jaine's report, he felt his stomach begin to perforate.

*What in the world is Rimuru thinking, letting his men evolve into True Demon Lords?!*

He would have taught him a lesson if he'd been there---Gazel sighed heavily. The phrase 'True Demon Lord' was loaded with meaning. A 'demon lord' was a title, meaning a monster king who ruled a territory. On the other hand, 'True Demon Lord' referred to the state of a monster. When a 'Demon Lord Seed' had awakened and evolved, it was simply called a 'True Demon Lord'. Actually, it was more accurate to say that it was just less than Catastrophe-class and the highest of a Disaster-class.

*...No, there are not so many Disaster-class, so it is not the highest rank.*

Disaster-class was a classification for demon lord. As such, only eight of them were applicable to this category now. It was assumed that several subordinates who had the same power as that of the highest-ranking ones had been born under Rimuru. It was a headache just to think about it. At any rate, Gazel complained to Elmesia as well.

He couldn't stand being the only one who suffered from this problem. So, he decided to share his pain with Elmesia. In conclusion, it was decided to continue the observation of Rimuru's group until a problem occurred. This was actually a postponement of the problem, but it was the best they could do since nothing could actually be done. If they ever decided that there was a real danger, it would mean the beginning of a battle for the survival of the human race.

"I don't want that to happen."

Gazel sighed to himself. Gazel received another piece of bad news.

"Oh my. The Mixed Corps is on the move! It appears that they are engaged in a war with someone."

The voice was calm, but Gazel sensed the panic that was typical of the darker side. Before he could get a more detailed report, he sent out a messenger to summon Dolph and the others. A few minutes later.

<I'm sure of it. That is not the work of a mere person. It's a monster. Not even a demon lord, but a monster beyond imagination.>

<A True Dragon, huh?>

<Ah. I've never seen her before, but I'm pretty sure it's Velgrynd, even though she looks like a human.>

It was a 'Magic Communication' from Admiral Paladin Vaughn, who was on assignment in the Eastern city. Gazel and the others understood the situation by having the images transferred to them. The worst thing always happened when they least expected it. Gazel now understood this fact painfully.

The sky was on fire. A Beautiful woman danced coolly, and powerful men fell to the ground one by one. The flames were beautiful and awe-inspiring. But the real horror came later. Velgrynd, who was reflected in the crystal ball for the surveillance magic, turned her eyes towards Gazel and the others. Just as Gazel was thinking it to be a coincidence, the crystal ball shattered.

"She was watching us too."

"I can't believe it. That's ridiculous..."

"No way! How far away do you think we are?!"

"It's the truth. They may have sensed the magic and traced it back to the caster. Even so, how could they affect the destination of the magic transfer? Such a thing is impossible even for me...well...for a human being!"

Gazel listened silently to the words of his friends. The current incident made it clear that the other party was the enemy. But who was...

'Stop, don't spy on me'---he thought he heard in his ears, even though he couldn't hear anything.

*A True Dragon, huh? It's a true monster.*

Gazel now understood the true meaning of the word 'strongest'. He had heard rumors of a connection between the Empire and Velgrynd. There had been no way to determine the truth or falsity of such rumors, but he had made many assumptions so that he would be able to withstand an attack if one were to occur. However---

Gazel realized that this may have been nothing more than a delusion. It was unclear why the Empire had chosen now to send Velgrynd. No matter how much Gazel tried to understand what Emperor Rudra was thinking, he couldn't comprehend the situation. There was only one thing Gazel could do.

"I shall go into battle myself."

"Your Majesty, that's too dangerous!"

"Even so, he must go. Abandoning Vaughn will not save Dwargon. Dolph, be ready."

When Jaine spoke, Dolph had no choice but to remain silent. He had no intention of letting Vaughn die and realized that admonishing Gazel at this point would not change the situation.

"I will be ready to leave as soon as possible."

"I'll leave it to you."

Gazel nodded gravely and closed his eyes. There was a lot of work to do. The allies had to be notified, and instructions had to be given on how to deal with the remaining citizens. If Gazel and his allies won, that was good, but if they lost, what would they do? There was nowhere for the people to run. They would have no other means of survival than to submit to the Empire. That would mean the collapse of the nation of Dwargon, and to prevent that from happening, Gazel and his people could not afford to lose.

"The eastern cities will not have room for the entire army. Let us leave the rear to march on the ground and leave the command to the old men. Jaine, it's up to you to convince them!"

"I understand. So, King Gazel, what are you going to do?"

"I'll go first. After all, if I show up too late, I won't be able to have my turn, so plan accordingly."

Gazel smiled wryly as he said this. Playing the role of a powerful king, he tried to allay everyone's fears. Thus, the army was organized as quickly as possible. Gazel and his men did not wait long, and set out with only the Pegasus Knights led by Dolph.

![break]

As Gazel flew through the sky, he suddenly thought to himself.

*Is the reason why Rimuru gave his men power so that they could survive the war? If so, I have to say that he is being as lenient as ever.*

He realized the truth and couldn't help but laugh. He could not stop the smile from forming on his lips as he thought of his younger apprentice (Rimuru), who never gave up on his naive ideals.

"What is it, your majesty?"

"No, it's just a harmless fantasy."

"I'm sorry, but what do you mean?"

"Fufu, in spite of such a desperate situation, I suddenly remembered Rimuru. And then, for some reason, I felt that this time too, I could get through this crisis."

He was being too optimistic, but Gazel still thought it was better than being pessimistic as he laughed thoughtfully.

"That's right. As was the case with Charybdis, His Majesty Rimuru was also quite guileless. I was quite shocked by his connection with Demon Lord Milim."

Dolph laughed as he answered.

"If you are going to say that, I might as well mention the hardships those of us had to endure while monitoring the situation. We were getting tired of being accused of lying about whatever was reported."

Even Anrietta, who was usually taciturn and answered only what was asked of her---though sometimes sarcastic---said so. Gazel and Dolph could not hide their surprise.

"Fufufu, I'm sorry about that. I'll try to be better next time."

"So Anrietta-dono had grievances as well."

"Of course!"

"Wahahahaha! In that case Anrietta, say that to that Rimuru guy directly. I have trouble on my side too. I trust you guys, but Rimuru's behavior is just so insane. When I heard Jaine's report, I honestly doubted Jaine's sanity."

"Haha, that report was outrageous."

"Since I am usually the one to report, I enjoyed it this time as a spectator."

Gazel and Dolph erupted in laughter at Anrietta's sarcasm. The sky was filled with echoing laughter.

"I would also like to mention something. I had also sent a message to His Majesty Rimuru with a complaint."

"So you did."

Gazel nodded and looked forward. His unease was gone. Gazel flew towards the battlefield, radiating the high spirits befitting of a champion.

![hard scene break]

Time goes back. The day after drinking with Elmesia-san, the sun had already reached its zenith.

"You're up early, Rimuru-sama."

"I'm sorry."

The smiling Shuna was just so scary. The only option was to apologize, so I took the initiative. What's the big deal about getting drunk and sleeping in---that's what I've been trying to say, but I wondered if I should be scolded for it. Shuna let out a big sigh and looked at me with a stern stare.

"So, have you reached a conclusion?"

"W-what are you talking about?"

"You were troubled last night, weren't you? I am afraid that you are going to do something reckless again, I was also---no, not only me, but all of us were worried."

I couldn't help but be touched when she said that. Don't worry. I'm not going to do anything reckless. If not, I will run away, and I will complain to Guy and ask him to do something about it. But before that, I was going to give something a try.

"We'll figure it out. Safety is the number one priority this time, too."

I answered cheerfully, but Shuna kept an anxious look on her face. I guess it was impossible to fool Shuna who had the Unique Skill 'Analyst'. Or perhaps it would have been obvious even without it. It was just as well. I really didn't want to do something dangerous like this.

Although I said I'd put safety first, we still didn't fully know the enemy's strength. In particular, Lieutenant Kondou, Velgrynd, and Emperor Rudra were all powerful opponents no matter how you looked at it. Not only was it an unwinnable situation, but there was a possibility that we might be killed on the spot. I tried to find a way to avoid such a possibility, but even Wisdom King Raphael-san could not find an answer to this question.

If I don't know the answer, it was just a matter of guessing. The only thing I could do was to reduce the danger as much as possible by putting my maximum effort into the project. And that's how we got here.

"Actually, I was having a hard time deciding who to take with me. This time, I'm going with only an elite group. I feel bad saying this, but those who are not strong enough to go would only be a liability."

"---Yes. My brother was very determined to go with you since this morning."

It seems that my thoughts really had been exposed. I had been dealing with Elmesia-san since yesterday morning, so I hadn't told everyone about my talk with Guy yet. And yet, Shuna was smiling at me, as if she understood everything. I smiled, thinking that I was no match for her. Shuna reported to me in a natural manner.

"Last night, the mysterious Laplace arrived. He said he had a message for Rimuru-sama, but since he didn't make a request in advance, we are keeping him waiting."

This was a sudden change of subject, but it didn't seem to be of that much importance. If it really was urgent, Gadra or the others would have contacted us. I guess Yuuki was the person from whom the message was sent, but I wondered what the message was about.

"It's a bit of a hassle, but let's meet."

"Yes, I really wanted to turn him away, but he is still an ally for now. In that case, I will show you to the reception room."

Shuna didn't like Laplace either. Unusually for Shuna, who rarely expressed her likes and dislikes in her attitude, she was very blunt in her treatment of the clowns. After all, she couldn't easily forgive Laplace and the others for causing the death of the ogre village. We shouldn't forget that, even if they are our allies.

"While I'm talking to Laplace, gather the executives who are awake in the conference room."

I asked Shuna to do so. I had a lot of things to think about, but I would worry about all of them after the war with the Empire was over. I placed my doubts out of my mind and decided to take care of the immediate problems first.

![break]

Twenty people, including myself, gathered in the conference room. Rigurd and four of the elders under him---Rugurd, Regurd, Rogurd, and Lilina-san. Kaijin, Vesta, and Myourmiles-kun were also here. Then there were seven members of the 'Twelve Chaos Guardian Lords'. There was also Benimaru, Shion, Diablo, Gabil, and the three demon girls, Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera. Finally, there was Souei, Hakurou, Gobta, and Gadra.

I was going to ask Gadra to be our guide in the Empire. To be honest, I thought it was a little bit too much, but Gadra was the one who would be the least sad if something happened to me, so I had chosen him for this mission. By the way, Bernie was also asked to be a guide for the Empire. However, he rejected the offer, because he was a liability to us now that he had lost his power. Gadra would be enough.

Well, let's see then. I feel like I've only been having meetings all this time, but I can't complain about that. Our country has grown too big now to just decide everything by our own will. Having said that, I would just tell everyone what I had decided this time. Shuna, as usual, served tea to everyone. After making sure he had left quietly, I opened my mouth.

"The reason I asked you all to gather here is to inform you of the decision regarding the final battle against the Empire. But before that... Come on in."

I had already decided who we were taking with us, so there was no need to panic for now. Instead, I had decided to introduce Laplace, who had come as an emissary, to everyone. Laplace's message, as I had expected, was related to the joint struggle. The army blockading the east entrance of Dwargon was going to attack the capital, and he wanted us to join them. It was as Guy told me, and I was not planning to deny it. However, I had come to the conclusion that it would not be a battle of armies, but instead a battle of the elites.

Since I did not want to cause any damage to civilians, I had come to the conclusion that I needed to discuss the details with Yuuki. And so, I decided to set up a meeting on short notice. I had already discussed this with Yuuki through Laplace, and the date had been set for tomorrow afternoon. I would explain the situation to the assembled people. I really wanted to leave everything to Laplace, but he was too shady and I wouldn't let him do it. I was once again reminded of the importance of trust.

"Hello, hello, hello, everybody. I am Laplace. I'm the vice president of the Moderate Clown Troupe, and Yuuki-san, our boss, sent me this time as an emissary."

Wow, he's still such a suspicious-looking guy. I didn't understand why it was necessary to dance at a time like this, but, well, he was sent as an emissary, so I couldn't just ignore him.

![full page image](image10)

It seems I wasn't the only one who was annoyed, as Souei was even preparing to make a dangerous move. I understood his feelings, but I'd have to ask him to hold back here.

"Souei-kun, put away that kunai."

"...Yes."

Stay on your guard, Souei. He sat down quietly, but one could never be too careful. Let's just finish the introduction quickly.

"Laplace-san here is the contact person for Yuuki."

"You can just call me Laplace if ya want."

"Oh, yeah? Well, then I'll do that."

Since he said so, I would take his word for it. I was just going to do whatever I wanted to do, regardless of whether he was a messenger or not.

"Yuuki and I will be having a meeting tomorrow. It's a bit sudden, but Laplace is going to take me there, so there's no need to worry about the travel time. The important thing is who will go with me."

And finally, we got to the point.

"I can only bring up to six people at a time. Since myself and His Majesty Rimuru have already been confirmed, who are the other four people?"

Truthfully, I would have liked to bring the strongest to fight. But currently, we did not have all of our members anyway. Ranga was sleeping in my shadow. Geld was not yet awake. Kumara, Zegion, and Adalmann, the labyrinthine group, were also holed up in their own domains and showed no sign of waking up. Since there were individual differences in evolutionary sleep, I understood that this was just how things were. For now, I'd just have to confirm who would go between those who were able.

"Benimaru, I need you to come with me. How are you feeling?"

"What, does he have a cold or something?"

Laplace asked with a puzzled look, but I was not going to tell him about the awakening. I knew he would find out sooner or later, but I was not kind enough to explain it to him.

"No problem. I'm in excellent condition."

Benimaru smiled wryly, completely ignoring Laplace and maintaining his cool demeanor. Unlike me, he had a big heart, and I was impressed at times like this. I looked at Benimaru carefully and saw that he had somehow changed his race. It seems that Benimaru had evolved successfully and things were going well with Momiji and Alvis. It was only later that I heard the following story. Benimaru had to take turns with his new wives over the course of two nights. I should be saying that I was very proud of him...but I was really just jealous as hell...

After abandoning his physical body, he was reborn and had become a full spiritual life form. His race was called a 'flame spirit oni', a kind of divine spirit. Like the 'True Dragons', he had both the holy and demonic attributes, so he could also be called a holy demonic spirit. A divine monster spirit was a subordinate existence of the 'True Dragon' race. Like the 'True Dragons', they had various attributes, and fire was considered to be a major attribute. Attributes were the laws that governed the principles of this world, and there were eight kinds in total.

There were the natural attributes of 'earth', 'water', 'fire', and 'wind' and the attribute of 'space'. These were known as the five major attributes. It was said that fire was strong against earth, water was strong against fire, wind was strong against water, space was strong against wind, and earth was strong against space. The earth was consumed by fire, fire was extinguished by water, water was dissipated by wind, wind was isolated by space, and space was indexed only by the earth. In such a way, the five major attributes were in a conflicting relationship.

In addition to these five attributes, there were two opposing attributes, 'light' and 'darkness', along with the attribute of 'time', which was not bound by anything and reigned over all attributes. Fire spirits such as Ifrit were also bound by these physical laws. Or rather, spirits were the embodiment of the laws of the world, and they also had eight attributes. It seems that 'light' and 'darkness' were special, and light was derived from angels while darkness was derived from demons. It seems that angels and demons, which were confirmed now, could also be called spirits if we traced back their origins.

Diablo and others might be able to say more about this, but it didn't make much sense to me, and I was not particularly interested in knowing about it. The important thing was that there were eight kinds of divine spirits, and they were higher than normal spirits. The highest among them were the 'True Dragons', of which only four had been confirmed as of now. Veldanava, the 'Star King Dragon', I think, had the attributes of space and earth, associated with stars. Perhaps, there may have been many more attributes.

'Frost Dragon' Velzard was likely water-based.

'Scorch Dragon' Velgrynd was most certainly fire-based.

And our 'Veldora-san', apart from water and wind, could even control space. He was a surprisingly great guy.

In short, the 'True Dragon' race was the pinnacle of the divine spirits. And Benimaru had evolved into a being similar to that of a 'True Dragon'. Although a 'flame spirit oni' was a spiritual life form, he had a physical body so that he could influence the material world. It appeared that his lifespan had no boundaries, so it would not be an exaggeration to call him a divine oni.

I was impressed by this truly special evolution. As for the total magicule count, it had also increased greatly. In my opinion, it was several times larger than that of Karion's. It may not be as large as Luminas in terms of maximum value, but it seemed to be a good match for it. I believed he would be able to compete with the 'Single Digits' of the Empire.

"Great! Then Benimaru will be the first choice. And now, for the second person..."

Gadra was chosen, so we are left with two more people. Shion and Diablo would also go with us, so I would have exactly four members.

"Gadra for directions. Shion and Diablo as my secretaries."

The people who would be taken by Laplace would be me, Gadra, Benimaru, Shion, and Diablo.

"Leave it to me, Rimuru-sama! You'll be safe and sound with me!" Shion said with a big smile.

What are you talking about? I was quite anxious, but I knew I could count on Shion as an escort. She had defeated Razul, who was a superior fighter, and in terms of combat, Shion was a force to be reckoned with.

"Kufufufufu. I don't know what Guy is up to, but it was outrageous of him to bother Rimuru-sama. I will go with you and see to it that all of your worries are removed!"

He was as confident as ever. But it was not wrong to say that we were in good hands with Diablo. He was capable of doing his job, and this was the time to rely on him. Although we were an elite group, we could not rest on our laurels. The rest of those remaining would follow, and I would ask them to come to the Empire later. I was about to say that, but before I could, someone expressed their dissatisfaction.

"Please wait, Rimuru-sama. I think I would be better suited to be your guide. Please allow me to accompany you."

It was Testarossa. Indeed, Testarossa was from the imperial side and seemed to know the geography well. She was an active military attaché and also a skilled negotiator. She was a good fighter too---in fact, she might even be stronger than me. The only advantage of taking Gadra with us was that he may or may not be able to meet Yuuki. If I thought about it though, I'd be able to manage without him.

Gadra was also strong, but not as strong as Testarossa. Besides, there was still a fear of not knowing if he would defect. Because of that, I felt that I would not have to be sad no matter what happened, though I also felt a little sorry for him. I would take Testarossa's advice here.

"Okay. I'll swap out Gadra and have Testarossa come in."

"Thank you very much for your kindness."

Testarossa smiled beautifully. Oh, how gorgeous. Gadra did not seem to have any complaints either.

"Well then, it looks like things are decided, so I'm gonna go get ready. Please give me a call when we leave."

"That's great, but what do you mean 'get ready'?"

When I asked him what he needed to do to get ready, Laplace gave me a bashful look.

"W-Well, that's..."

"It's the hot springs. This guy has been going back and forth between the cafeteria and the hot spring since yesterday, enjoying the recreation facilities like nobody else!"

Souei reported to us in an irritated tone. It's no wonder we have to keep an eye on him.

"Hahaha, so ya knew. That's not very nice, Souei-san."

How could we not know? Laplace had some guts, didn't he?

"You paid for it, didn't you?"

"Well, ya see, I'm a guest, right? I'll repay ya with my future work, so please just pay for this time."

How cheeky!

"You know..."

"Well, well, well, isn't it this country's fault for being too wonderful? Right now, this place is the most advanced in the world, no doubt about it! It's a paradise. Who wouldn't want to relax here?"

Laplace then emphasized the advantages of this country. It didn't feel bad being praised that much. I think Laplace is a nice guy. My impression of him has changed a bit.

"You're being deceived, Rimuru-sama!"

"Don't worry, Benimaru. I will keep an eye on Rimuru-sama even if he lets his guard down."

Oops. I'm going to be careful after listening to Benimaru and the others' conversation. One cough.

"Just in moderation."

"I get what ya mean! Well, I'll leave ya to it."

As soon as Laplace said this, he walked out of the conference room with a cheerful look on his face. After seeing him run off like a free spirit, I decided to move on to the next item on the agenda.

![soft scene break]

"Isn't it a bit risky to send just five people into enemy territory?"

"I agree with you. If something happens to Rimuru-sama, no matter how many victories we have in the war, we will not be able to recover."

"You're right. I agree that an army is useless in a battle of the elites, but there must be someone who can shield Rimuru-sama in case of an emergency."

Souei, Gabil, and Hakurou, in turn, expressed their objections to the previous plan. They seemed to have been dissatisfied with it, although they had kept silent in front of Laplace.

"Master Hakurou is right. I, too, am prepared to take Rimuru-sama's place when the time comes. It's called a meat shield, isn't it?"

"Hey, Gobta."

"Ah!"

Meat shield, huh? While I can imagine what he's trying to say, I'd really appreciate it if he didn't do that.

"Hakurou, please stop educating Gobta about such things."

"I understand. But please realize that it is important to teach them to be prepared for such a case."

Hakurou's point was understandable. It's just that my heart could not accept it.

"I'm glad you all care about me, but I care about everyone else, too. I do not want to make a plan that assumes sacrifice from the start, so let's just all pool our wisdom in order to avoid such a situation."

"That's right. It seems I may be getting a little ahead of myself."

Perhaps they were not convinced. On this issue, even Benimaru and the others seemed to be on Hakurou's side. I might have felt the same way if I were in a different position. But even so...

I was happy for everyone's feelings, but I still didn't want to see anyone else sacrificed. I know it's selfish, but I would put my feelings first here.

"In any case, it's not okay to have a war strategy that requires sacrifice. With that in mind, let's move on to the final stage of the war against the Empire."

Everyone nodded in agreement with me. Regardless of their sentiments, it should be possible to calmly formulate a strategy.

"Rimuru-sama, I have an idea."

"What is it, Souei?"

"I am currently sneaking my 'Clone' into the Empire. I haven't reached the capital yet because of many obstacles, but it seems that the security network is more relaxed than before. I am thinking of joining Laplace's teleportation by using 'Shadow Step'. Is that okay?"

Well, that was reassuring. Souei's excellence as a covert agent could be especially felt at a time like this. His combat ability was also impeccable. And upon closer inspection, I was able to see that he had evolved. Souei was not just an oni, but a 'dark spirit oni'. It seemed that Souei had also received a gift in conjunction with the evolution of Benimaru.

Souei had been raised as a shadow of Benimaru in the ogre village. Benimaru was the front end and Souei was the back end. Although they were in a hierarchical relationship, they were still the best of friends. In other words, he was Benimaru's counterpart. Because they were such a pair, the influence of Benimaru's awakening was most strongly felt by him. Presumably, Souei was being treated like a subordinate to Benimaru.

Well, it seems that his attitude was the same as before, so it did not seem to be a big problem. A 'dark spirit oni' was like a dark demonic spirit, and like Benimaru, he had a physical body while still being a spiritual life form. Was he being treated as a subordinate deity of Benimaru? He was not as high-ranking a demon, but he did have a medium amount of magicules. The total was not as high as Benimaru's, but it was higher than the half-awakened Clayman's had been.

His strength was enough. The current Souei could fight with Karion, Frey, and other ex-demon lords at least on equal terms. Was it because of this evolution that he was now able to get through the imperial vigilance? I thought so, but I didn't care either way. Souei was welcome to come along, so I had nothing to complain about. But then again, there still remained the problem of Masayuki's escort.

"That's reassuring. But what about Masayuki?"

"I will continue to monitor with my 'Clone'. If anything goes wrong, I'm sure I'll be able to handle it." Souei answered confidently.

Diablo also interrupted from the side.

"In that case, why don't you let Venom mix in as one of Masayuki's associates? As long as we do not tell the boy, he can serve as both a protector and a watchdog. Souei-dono's burden would be lightened, and it would also serve as an insurance policy."

Yes, that was a good idea. Venom had a sensible character, unlike most demons, and was strong in his own way. He and Masayuki seemed to get along well with each other. It would be interesting to entrust him with this project.

"In that case, your second-in-command will be gone."

"Kufufufu, no problem. Testarossa and the others are here, so my own work will not be affected."

Then we were all set.

"Souei, is that okay with you?"

"I think it is more reliable to go inside than to watch from the shadows. If that can be arranged, I will also be able to save the power divided amongst the 'Clones'."

Then it was decided.

"Well then, please do so."

"Understood!"

"Leave it to me."

Venom was now escorting Masayuki, and Souei would join him there. The question that remained was whether or not to mobilize the army...

"In a joint fight with Dwargon, we need to show our military might against the Empire, don't we?"

The First and Third Corps had already returned home together when the bodies were recovered. In other words, the entire army was staying here, in the capital city of Rimuru. As long as Geld, the head of the Second Corps, was in an evolutionary sleep, the Second Corps could not be moved. In which case---

"Rimuru-sama, I think this is where we come in, don't you?"

"Wait a minute! We should go!"

Aside from Gabil, Gobta was also unusually motivated. But unlike last time, I think it was dangerous to rely on numbers this time. If they had a large army, it was unlikely they would attack us with a large-scale mass attack, but this time, they had a small number of elites. They might use nuclear magic without any hesitation, or they might expose us to more aggressive means of attack. In a magic battle against an army, one normally relied on the strength of legion magic. Before the legion magic was broken, the elite forces attacked each other, but if the opponents were all above a certain level of strength, it was thought that the soldiers on the bottom would only be a hindrance.

"Hakurou, tell me what you think."

"Hohoho. I understand what Rimuru-sama is thinking. I am sure you are correct."

"In other words, apprentices are out of the question, and we shouldn't take any low-ranking soldiers with us?"

"I think we should do so in order to avoid casualties as much as possible."

"In that case..."

"I guess only the Goblin Riders should be the ones to go?"

"From my corps, only the Hiryuu will go out to the battlefield!"

It had to be that way. Goblin Riders were ranked A in terms of the combined strength of the goblin-wolf duo. They had played the role of decoys very well in this war, and they would not be killed so easily. They were the best at just running away, so it seemed to me that this would not be a problem. I had no complaints with the Hiryuu. With Gabil's awakening, all of them were now above A rank. I had some concerns about their power control, but I think they would be okay.

"So, Gobta and Gabil should prepare to go---no, wait?"

I was about to give the go ahead, but then I remembered something very important.

"Gobta, can you even call out your star wolf partner right now?"

"Eh?"

"I mean, Ranga hasn't finished waking up yet, and I'm guessing his family members are still sleeping, too."

"Ah!!"

Apparently, he couldn't call them out.

"You're not going."

"B-but..."

"Gobta, are you trying to say that you cannot recognize your own strength?"

"I'm sorry."

Gobta was looking down with a sigh of sadness, but it couldn't be helped. The superiority of the Goblin Riders was due to the high mobility of the star wolves. Even if each rider was of A-plus rank, we could not take them with us.

"It's not your fault. Help Rigur to keep the peace!"

"I understand!"

Unfortunately, Gobta and the others were not able to go. Then, who else could go out to the battlefield?

"Is the Kurenai all right?"

"No problem. All of them have reached A rank."

That's what I'm talking about. Gobua was an excellent commander, and there were several who had evolved into kijin after receiving the gifts. They should be reliable if they were allowed to participate in the war.

"What about the 'Dark Shadows'?"

"They have been dispersed to various places to gather information and search for enemies. If necessary, I will call them back."

"No, they should continue to work behind the scenes."

"Understood."

There was no need to call them all together. It went without saying that information was important, so they should continue as they were.

"That left the Yomigaeri, but..."

"Leave it to us! We are always ready and waiting for the opportunity!"

"Hmmm, well..."

Shion's awakening showed no change. However, the fighting ability of Yomigaeri had increased significantly, and some of them had even reached A rank. The advantage of the Yomigaeri was that they were not prone to death, and I felt that it would be safe to have them participate in the battle---but the Yomigaeri did not show their true value unless they were paired with Shion. Without a leader, the Yomigaeri would be acting without a leader. In this case, I decided that it would be safer to leave the Yomigaeri here, just like Gobta and his group.

"I see. They should stay at home."

"Oh, why?"

"The Yomigaeri is more of an escort group than an army, and I feel safer if Shion comes with me."

"I see!"

Shion easily agreed. With that, we had decided on the units to be deployed. There would be one hundred Hiryuu and three hundred Kurenai. The total number was 400, but all of them were excellent fighters at Over A rank. Although inferior in number, their combat ability was excellent. However, this was still not enough to make me feel secure.

"Well then, Ultima, Carrera, I have a mission for you."

"I'll do it! Anything you say!"

"What's the mission, milord?"

"Ultima will continue to accompany Gabil's unit as an intelligence officer. And Carrera, this time, assist Gobua, not Geld."

"Yeah...lizards again?"

"Leave it to me. I'll help them out discreetly."

That was a vaguely unsettling response. Ultima seemed to have developed a bad feeling for Gabil and his crew, and it was hard to believe that Carrera would keep a low profile on her own.

"Oh my, Ultima-dono is not happy with us?"

"Yes, there's a lot to be upset about all over the place! Should I say that it's because you're creepy, or that I can't understand you with my common sense..."

"Hahaha, do not worry! We will take the battle seriously!"

"Experimenting with enemy attacks in the middle of a battle, that's not taking things seriously, is it?"

"What do you mean? It is a good idea to try every possible tactic to gain an advantage in a battle. Experimentation is a part of that and should be taken seriously, right?"

"No, it's not! That's something that should be done before the battle starts! I mean, why do I have to be giving this lecture?!"

Well, it was only natural to have a bad feeling about it. Even as I was listening to this, I felt that Ultima was in the right.

"I'm sorry, but can you bear with him this one time?"

"If Rimuru-sama orders me to do so, then I'll do my best. I was thinking that I would have to teach him a lot of things anyway, so this is a good opportunity for me to look on the bright side."

Ultima, who put on an adorable face even with her eyes glazed over, looked at Gabil as if trying to estimate his value and answered me. I guess I could trust her to take care of Gabil, even though they didn't seem to be a good match.

"And you, Carrera, you don't have to think about keeping a low profile anyway."

"Oh?"

I think it's absurd to try to be inconspicuous. Instead, I hope Carrera will try to find the perfect timing.

"Try to think first and foremost about avoiding damage to your allies. After that, you can just stay quiet until the battle starts."

"Simple is good!"

Really? I reminded her that I would not make any more demands, and that she should be absolutely sure to comply with the ones I had given. I hoped this would help.

"Hakurou, will you accompany Gobua?"

"Of course."

"I'll leave to take Carrera's reins."

Hakurou nodded his head with a wry smile. I felt temporarily relieved.

![break]

And with that, we had decided the lineup---but then, Gadra raised his hand and asked to make a statement.

"Rimuru-sama, at the risk of sounding presumptuous, I have a proposition to make."

"What is it?"

"In my humble opinion, I think that the Demon Colossus should also participate in this war."

I see. Taking it out of the labyrinth was a bit of a problem, but even if it broke, no one would be harmed. Even though it was operated by a passenger, Gadra would be able to escape safely. Gadra had the 'Resurrection Bracelet' equipped with the emergency return spell. It was a big advantage for us to be able to observe him safely no matter what kind of fierce battle zone we threw him into. However, would it be a problem to disclose his fighting ability?

"Vesta, what do you think?"

When I asked Vesta for his opinion, a wry smile appeared on his face. He raised his glasses and opened his mouth.

"This is the perfect place for his unveiling. I have already given a detailed report to King Gazel, and he has been asking to see the real thing for some time now. I would like to receive the data under all circumstances, and it would be interesting for me to know how it would perform on the actual battlefield."

Vesta was a researcher after all. The value of a weapon was determined by how powerful it was. Even for the purpose of a demonstration, it was meaningless unless it had been used at least once. Judging from that perspective, this battlefield was a good place for demonstration. Vesta must have thought so. Indeed, the Demon Colossus, unlike weapons of mass destruction, was suitable for local warfare. It would be useful for intimidating the opponent and discouraging their will to fight. Now that I had allowed the three demon girls to go out, it would be wrong for me to reject this offer due to any moral grounds.

"What if the enemy takes it away from us?"

"I swear I will not make that mistake!"

"If that happens, we will just develop a better Elemental Colossus for next time. There is no end point to technology. That said, if that were to happen, we have installed a self-destruct mechanism, so there is no need to worry about the technology leaking out."

Wait, wait, wait. He said that as if it was a good thing, but all I could hear was a phrase I couldn't ignore.

"Self-destruct mechanism?"

"That's right. It was Veldora-sama's idea to include it. I had thought it was some kind of joke, but it's true that Veldora-sama is a master of the arts, so must have anticipated this kind of situation."

No, he didn't. Definitely not. There was no doubt that it was Veldora who made such a stupid suggestion. I guessed that the only people who could ever come up with an idea like a self-destruct mechanism had to be either Ramiris or Veldora---avid manga readers. Really, I wish people would stop obsessing over such useless things. Still, it was true that it was something better to have than not.

"Okay. It's fine if it breaks or falls into enemy hands, but just don't do anything reckless."

"So then?"

"Yes, you're cleared to go. Gadra may not get a chance to join, but he's welcome to join us in case of an emergency."

"Understood. I, for my part, have no desire to be rude to a former colleague. If there is a new type of weapon that I do not know about, that is where the Demon Colossus will come in!"

In that case, I would leave it to him with peace of mind. Gadra had no deep ties to us, so he might betray us if we were on the losing end. Perhaps he wanted to stay out of the labyrinth in case of such a situation. It felt that way, though it was not worth pursuing. I would like to think positively here and try not to make Gadra feel like having second thoughts. In other words, all we had to do was to overwhelmingly win the war against the Empire. Thus, Gadra's participation in the war had been decided along with all the other members who would go.

![soft scene break]

The meeting ended in the evening. As soon as the meeting was dismissed, everyone began to prepare for the next day. As for me, I was going to enjoy a relaxing time in the cafeteria. Tomorrow's schedule would be to start the morning with a moral boost for the departing group. After that, I would send everyone off with the 'transfer technique'. From noon, I would be meeting with Yuuki. Laplace would give me a lift, so I had enough time to spare. It would be a one-day trip, so I didn't need to do much preparation. Of course, I didn't intend to bring any souvenirs for Yuuki, so I could welcome tomorrow with an easy mind.

"Are you sure you can just take it easy like that?"

"It'll be fine. What about you? Is it really okay to just leave Momiji and Alvis-san alone?"

Benimaru had come to the cafeteria with me, but he was a newlywed, so why didn't he just stay at home? I was thinking so, to which Benimaru gave a laugh.

"Shuna is going to teach them how to cook today. I heard that they made an agreement not to run off on each other, though I got kicked out because of it..."

Hey now, are those really the words of a newlywed? I thought it might be a bad idea, but it wasn't my place to interfere in other people's family affairs.

"Well, okay then."

I nodded my head in agreement. Diablo came hurriedly to bring us our meals. He looked like a real butler. Well, I've always wondered whether it was really okay for a primordial demon to do such a thing, but since he was so happy, it was not my place to stop him. I'd gotten used to it, so it was too late now.

"Thank you."

"No, no, this is my role as well."

Is that so? Well, there was no problem if he was satisfied with it.

"Rimuru-sama, please use this too."

Shion poured me a glass of wine. Of course, Shion did not make this wine, so I could drink it with peace of mind, but it still made me feel a bit suffocated. Today's menu was just the familiar pork cutlet, which could be eaten easily without being served this way. And yet, Diablo and Shion were standing behind me, which instead was mentally exhausting.

"Why don't you guys just sit down and eat with us?"

"Your sentiments are very kind."

"Oh, no! I'm already full, so don't worry about me!"

"After all, Shion was in the kitchen eating a few morsels!"

"Diablo, you---!"

They fought at every opportunity. It was foolish to worry about them, so Benimaru and I decided to leave them alone and enjoy our meal.

"So, are you going to trust Yuuki?"

"It's difficult to be honest, but I guess I'll just have to believe. Besides, I want to believe in him too."

"Then I will follow Rimuru-sama and will set up all plans on the premise of trusting Yuuki."

"What if they betray us?"

"It wouldn't be good, but there's always a way to make it."

"Okay, I'm sorry to be troubling you, but please do so."

"That's just what I want."

Benimaru's smile was so encouraging. In war, one could only trust their allies or friends. If even this was in doubt, there would be no maneuver that could succeed. If we were betrayed, the damage would be so great that I would have to make a difficult choice. Still, I have decided to trust Yuuki. Now that I have decided so, there is no point in worrying about it.

"I was wondering, do you have to eat^[He means, is it even necessary for Benimaru to consume food after evolving into a higher race.]?"

I asked Benimaru, who was eating a pork cutlet in front of me.

"If I had to answer whether or not it was necessary, I would say no."

"Oh, I knew it!"

"But Rimuru-sama is the same, right? I'm relieved that I haven't lost my sense of taste."

"I understand. When I couldn't even satisfy my three major desires, I honestly thought my life was over. Thanks to my hard work, my appetite and desire for sleep came back, so I am still enjoying every day."

"I'm sure. I was worried about that, too, but I'm relieved to see that things are back to normal."

We nodded to each other. Then, I suddenly felt something strange.

"Huh? You're still in your original state, so you still have all three desires?"

"Yes. Fortunately, all of them were preserved."

"And sleep?"

"I don't need to sleep, but meditating puts me into a state of sleep. Moreover, I will recover from fatigue if I do so."

What's with that? I've been able to sleep only after all my hard work, but he was able to do it from the very beginning? And it's even better than my results! No, what I'm more interested in is...

"And your libido?" I asked in a whisper.

Benimaru nodded his head in affirmation, looking a little embarrassed.

"What's this? I thought you couldn't evolve because you wouldn't be able to have children..."

"That's right. Momiji and Alvis are also both pregnant."

"Well then congratulations---no wait, didn't you lose your sexual desire too?"

"I thought it would disappear, too, but my libido remained even if I couldn't have children. I guess I won't have to give them any grief now."

I envy him too much. It's the perfect evolution, with all the features I don't have anymore. Damn it, how did I ever...

"Good for you."

"Thanks...why are you stealing my food?"

"Shut up! You traitor!"

My jealousy flared up as I snatched Benimaru's pork cutlet away from him.

*It was only natural*, I thought to myself. What else was I supposed to do when all I had to look forward to was eating? In any case, we had a good time that night, making a big deal out of things. It was the usual scene as always. However---

This daily routine came to an abrupt end.

![soft scene break]

"Oh, it's not good! Something terrible has happened and I have to get back right away!"

Laplace came running into the cafeteria while shouting. And right after that, another person came in.

"Something is wrong, Rimuru-sama! We just received a message in the name of King Gazel. Velgrynd has appeared in front of the Mixed Corps that is deploying, and he needs your help immediately!"

Vesta screamed with bloodshot eyes. I got up from my seat at this surprising content.

"Gather the members who are scheduled to leave as soon as possible!"

"Understood."

Benimaru moved immediately upon hearing my order. With that, everyone would be here in no time.

"Laplace, wait a minute before you go back. We'll go with you."

"B-But..."

Seeing Laplace's panic, I initially suspected it was an act. I thought he was up to something again, trying to trap us. However, when I heard the following report from Vesta, I understood that this was not the case. Something important was happening in the Empire that Laplace did not know about. In times like this, it was important to remain calm.

"I know something big is going on, but don't panic. We're allies now. It's more convenient for you to go back with us rather than to go back alone."

"Convenient?"

If the enemy's maximum strength was in front of the Mixed Corps, this could be considered as an opportunity. Yuuki and the others seemed to have been attacked by someone, but if we defeated them, we would be able to proceed with the negotiations in a favorable way. With this in mind, I decided to ask Laplace for more information.

"So, what happened?"

Laplace answered my question after some hesitation.

"I got a call from Teare. The chairman, Kagali-sama, wants me to come back. Apparently, we are being attacked by Kondou and others."

Lieutenant Kondou, he seemed to be one of the troublesome ones. I guess it would be a good idea to cooperate with Laplace and take him out. But what was worrying was that Yuuki and his group, with their battle strength, was unable to do anything.

"What is Yuuki doing? Did he lose, too?"

"It seems that Damrada is the boss's opponent."

"Damrada was one of the heads of Cerberus, who was actually the vice commander of the Imperial Guardians. Did he betray Yuuki after all?"

He made us think he was Yuuki's comrade, but was that not the case? Since I had never met him, I couldn't read into what he was thinking.

"I don't know. Both Teare and Footman often go back and forth. Anyway, it seems that they are fighting against the boss."

Hmm, I don't get it. However, what is certain is that there are some nasty enemies scattered about. In any case, the first thing to do is to check the situation. And so, I invoked the physical magic: 'Argus' on the spot to save time. Since I already knew the coordinates, I pinpointed the location of the Mixed Corps garrison. The local situation was projected on the wall of the cafeteria.

"Th-This is..."

I wondered who had involuntarily muttered that. A beautiful woman with a glamorous smile. Her distinctive feature was her azure hair tied like a chignon on her head. The woman was wearing a gorgeous Chinese garb and a military uniform draped over her shoulders. She was standing before a huge army of 60,000 men as if she were walking through an uninhabited field. No, not a large army, but rather what used to be a large army. Soaring overhead were presumably the corpses. A crimson pillar connecting heaven and earth---yes, that was a hyper-gravity force field. Blood rained down, staining the entire force field a bright red.

"'Gravity Collapse'. Good grief, using my best move without my permission!"

Carrera spoke lightly, but her expression was serious. And as it should be. The magic used by the supposed Velgrynd was more precise than the one used by Carrera. It was perfectly ranged and controlled without going haywire. The absence of any evidence of destruction suggested that it affected only gravity.

"Did she control gravity and blow up only the army without affecting the earth?"

"That's right, milord, and the ugly thing is, not a single grain of sand was involved. She only blasted those she deemed as enemies into the sky."

Is such a thing even possible? No, I think she is able. As long as the result was right in front of me, I couldn't doubt it.

"Are you going to fight that thing?"

"Kufufufu, so that is the sister of Veldora-sama. Interesting. I've always wanted to fight her seriously."

Diablo was pretty tough, but Velgrynd honestly seemed like an unbeatable opponent.

![break]

<<No. If you give it your all, you have a chance.>>

![break]

That was reassuring, but the problem was that it would take an all-out effort. There would definitely be casualties, so we should avoid fighting if at all possible. In that case, it would be better to go for Emperor Rudra rather than Velgrynd. Let Guy and Rudra settle their dispute and end this war. Then, we could avoid unnecessary sacrifices.

"But I don't understand. Why not just finish the magic?"

"Maybe it's because she doesn't like to destroy nature like we do?"

"No, that shouldn't be it. Look, the bodies that have been drained of blood are all piled up."

Testarossa pointed to a corner of the image. There were, indeed, many bodies piled up there. I split the screen and zoomed in on the location. There was a man in a military uniform and a woman whom I had seen before.

"Yuuki's secretary---Kagali-san?"

"She is our creator and the president of the Moderate Clown Troupe. Damn it! I didn't want to believe it, but it's true. I just got a message from Footman and Teare that Kagali-sama is being controlled by Kondou."

"Controlled? As in Mental Control?"

"Yes. And worst of all, Teare and Footman cannot resist Kagali-sama. I guess that's why I couldn't get the 'telegram' from them earlier, because they were ordered to stop."

That sucks. Mental Control. I think taking away a person's free will is the worst.

---But it was more than that. The current situation was very bad.

"I mean, how far does Kagali-san's domination affect her? Will you be okay?"

Laplace seemed to be seriously frustrated, though it was hard to tell while he was wearing a mask. If Laplace was unable to disobey orders as well as Teare and Footman, that would be a big problem.

"I'll be fine. Kagali-sama has created me, but I'm the only one who does not have to follow orders. What is more problematic is the fact that most of the members Yuuki-san has gathered have 'curses' engraved on them. Of course, the only ones I'm worried about are the executives, but the rest of them are in such a state that there's no point in thinking about it now."

Indeed, Yuuki's army was no more. Even if there were some survivors, they would not be able to escape from that magic. There were still some survivors outside the influence of the magic, but they seemed to have lost their will to fight after seeing the tragedy. They were not going to be a force to be reckoned with, even without the curse engraving. It was good news that Laplace was unaffected because the situation was so bad.

"Well, I'm glad you're okay at least."

"Don't worry about it. My friends are already done for."

Laplace spoke in the most matter-of-fact way he could. His voice remained calm and unaffected, sounding as if he didn't feel anything, but I didn't think that was the case. He was frustrated and remorseful that his friends were being manipulated. There was no doubt that it was from the heart. Without saying anything, I pat Laplace on the shoulder. Laplace looked at me in surprise. I spoke to Laplace in a cheerful tone as naturally as possible.

"I think it's too early to give up, don't you? Kagali-san is not dead. If Kondou is controlling her, she'll go back to normal if we defeat him. Yuuki is probably still fighting, so let's go help him and fight back!"

It was an attempt to comfort him, but that was better than being negative. In any case, we could leave the despair for later. What could be done now? It was important to think about that.

"You're a very noble man, saying the same thing as the boss. If it's human beings who persecuted and exiled us, and it's human beings who are helping us...it's a match made in heaven."

Laplace muttered and seemed to smile bitterly under his mask. I may look like a human, but I'm still a monster...

But then again, even if I'm a slime, I used to be human. Was it too much to correct those words here?

"I have a question, if ya don't mind."

"What is it?"

"What is it you want as a demon lord?"

So that's what this is about? Nothing I've done since the beginning has changed. From the moment I came into this world, I have had only one ambition.

"I want to live happily together with everyone. That's why I've built towns, created a country, and communicated with other countries. After that, I want to get along with people who have similar tastes and interests, while respecting diversity."

"Haven't you ever thought about taking over the world?"

"What's with that? That would be too much trouble."

"Huh? Once you have the world, you can do whatever you want!"

"So that would definitely get boring. It is only when there are different ideas and thoughts that there can be a wider range of possibilities. The more possibilities there are, the more fun you can have with your work!"

As I argued my point, Laplace looked at me with a puzzled look on his face. Then, as if in a panic, he waved his hand and shouted, 'Wait, wait, wait!'

"That's crazy! What do you mean by 'work'? We weren't talking about that now. We were talking about what happens after you take over the world!"

You're the one who doesn't know what you're talking about.

"So, you want everything to be your own way. Is that through some kind of thought control for other people? Or are you saying that you prefer to be under mental control like Kagali-san?"

"No, I don't think so..."

"I believe that freedom of thought, speech, and expression should be guaranteed. That is the respect for fundamental human rights, and it will be the driving force for diversity and cultural development."

"Huh? That's just going to increase the number of selfish, mouth-breathers. They'll never be able to come to an agreement and solvable problems will become unsolvable. How can you run a country like that?!"

He had a point. The greatest weakness of democracy was in how it divided national interests from personal feelings. But that itself was also part of developing diversity.

"That's okay. That's something we'll all think about overcoming together. I'm essentially a selfish being, so no amount of talking will move this country in a direction I don't want it to go."

I was fine with being the big-talker. Reign but do not rule. With these words in mind, I would continue to do what I had always done. Fortunately, there were many role models. I could learn from Luminas, who used religion as a cover for her rule, and from Elmesia-san, who used a ruling system that placed her at the top of the country. Well, I still had a long way to go, so there was no need to decide what to do now.

"So, national policies and such are an afterthought. What's more important is the development of culture. Yes, entertainment. Without it, the development of the country is meaningless."

This was the most important part. In order to make life interesting, a lot of entertaining works must be produced. For that reason, there should be no restrictions on thought and expression. Laplace looked at me puzzled as I explained this.

"I don't understand. Our family can't understand. He...the boss, he promised to take over the world and make it a better place to live. That's why I chose to believe in him, in Yuuki-san. But what's wrong with you?!"

"What?"

"Mocking our ambitions with such a lax resolve!"

"I'm not mocking you. I just think that world domination might not be as fun as you think, and it might be harder than you think."

Laplace was silent for a while upon hearing my answer. Then, he spoke.

"...I've known for a long time, this kind of thing."

Laplace sat on the floor without strength. His face was turned to the magically projected image, and he gazed at the pile of dead bodies with Kagali standing in front of them.

"You asked earlier what they were doing there. I'll tell you. This is the best-kept secret of all. You should know that we're undead elves...so I'll tell you about how we can increase their number."

Hmmm? Wait, wait, wait, this sounds really important.

"Calm down. This is not exactly the kind of thing you can talk about in the cafeteria, is it?"

"It doesn't matter. This is not the time for that. Listen, we were all created by Kagali-sama. That's what the Curse Lord is all about... Creating powerful majins by gathering the dead and their grudges...a forbidden spell...the forbidden spell 'Dead Birthday'."

The cafeteria was also a room for executives. There were no civilians in the dining room, but Laplace had a lot of guts. I couldn't believe that he would discuss such a top-secret matter in a place like this. Those who remained were Benimaru, who had returned after giving instructions, Souei Diablo, Shion Hakurou, the three demon girls, and Vesta, who had been watching the video with me after I finished my report. Before I knew it, Gabil had also returned, perhaps after giving instructions to the others. It was an important story, but it was fortunate that no one troublesome heard it.

"So that's it. What a nostalgic spell."

"You know about it, Diablo?"

Diablo was a magic maniac, so it came in handy at times like these. It would be a big help if he knew about it.

"The body I received from Rimuru-sama is also an application of the 'Dead Birthday'. In my case, I did not have a soul, but it was the best body for incarnation. The original purpose of using it is to unite more than 10,000 corpses and make its power one's own."

It's true that inhumane, evil, and taboo were the most common words to describe this kind of forbidden spell. Well, I can't say anything as someone who also took souls, so I'd leave that alone for now.

"I wonder if the 'make its power one's own' means to be possessed by a specific person?"

"It depends on the situation, but I think it's safe to assume so."

"Diablo-san is right. Footman, Teare, and Clayman are all surviving members of Kazalim-sama. They lost their homeland, and to remember the humiliation, they turned to the forbidden spell."

Laplace agreed. I guess my speculations were correct. That being the case, it would be bad to let the spell be completed.

"There were about 60,000 Mixed Corps out there. With that much material, they should be able to produce at least ten undead elves that can rival Clayman."

"Oh, come on..."

"And the trouble is, there are a lot of strong souls there. Unlike Footman and Teare, they may be able to control more powerful forces."

When I asked specifically what that meant, Laplace replied with disgust. This is what he said.

Footman and Teare were still immature in spirit because they had been engulfed by the mighty power. When Kazalim had first created the undead elves, he was not mature enough to distribute his soul and power. This was the reason why he had given them more power than they could handle. Clayman had used this mistake to his advantage and had succeeded in creating a successful undead elf.

However, that did not mean that Footman and Teare were failures. Their mental immaturity had delayed the growth of their intellects, but they still possessed great power. In fact, even the pre-evolutionary Clayman lagged behind Footman. In that aspect, he was more successful than Clayman in terms of fighting ability alone. If we consider the case of creating an undead elf specialized in strength out of 60,000 corpses, one could say that it would be a greater success story than Clayman. In that case, it would probably be condensed to six to seven persons. If these people were willing to sacrifice an army of a million for the sake of creating an awakened person, they were likely to do such a thing without any trouble.

"---We were all just kids then. Teare still is a kid, not to mention Footman. Clayman was the only one who had grown up. Clayman, too, destroyed himself with his idiotic outbursts. However, we don't think of it as your fault. It's the law of the jungle after all. It's only natural to test those we don't trust, and we don't mind sacrificing others in order to expand our power. These are our family's true feelings. Are you still willing to join hands with us?"

Clearly, Laplace had dared to say something that didn't need to be said. There was no point in pissing us off here, so it might have even been a bad idea. Still, the fact that Laplace said what he did was a good thing.

"Don't underestimate us. I will never forgive you for inciting the orcs and destroying the ogre village, but since Rimuru-sama has decided to join forces with you, there will be no opposition from us."

"Benimaru is right. My heart breaks just thinking about the regrets of everyone in my village, but even with what was done to everyone, mourning will not make one feel better. I will be able to forget my regrets only when we realize the world that Rimuru-sama desires, a world where everyone can live with laughter."

"Hmph, you may think that you can cut off the root of the scourge by turning everyone's hatred against you, but that is naive. That anger is not so easily erased. It is not such a small thing that can be extinguished just by torturing you."

"Well, that's correct. As you said, this world follows survival of the fittest. The worst thing of all was our own immaturity. You have cried because of your own immaturity as well, haven't you? In that case, you can understand how we feel."

Benimaru, Shion, Souei, and Hakurou. They had decided to fight together, swallowing their hatred for Laplace and the others in their hearts. It was only natural that they could not forgive Laplace's actions, but they were still trying to overcome them. As I thought at the time of Geld, Benimaru and the others truly had big hearts.

"Look, I haven't forgiven you guys, and I don't fully trust you, but you're my allies now. Let's forget our differences and fight together."

"---I'm counting on you. Please, I just want to help the boss and the chairman, so please help me."

Laplace bowed his head deeply, with a sincere attitude that was unlike that of the normally aloof man. If even this was acting, then I would never be able to trust anyone else. For the time being, I believed that I could trust him.

![soft scene break]

At Laplace's request, Benimaru and the others nodded their heads in approval. The gesture was so determined and charming.

"All right. So then, the six of us will infiltrate as planned, and go to Yuuki's rescue."

"Yes. Let's rescue that bastard so he can apologize properly later."

Benimaru was motivated. Well, it was Yuuki after all. I had a feeling that he would take down Damrada and then be calm as usual. The real problem was how to deal with Velgrynd. Just when I was about to give out my instructions, Shion made a surprising remark.

"This man Kondou is the mastermind, isn't he? Since he is the one who manipulated Kagali and the others, Clayman might have been manipulated too."

" " "..." " "

We were all silent. Benimaru was frozen with a surprised look on his face, and Laplace muttered a 'what?' to himself.

"Kufufu. The first secretary sure says some interesting things."

Diablo tried to laugh it off, but then he seemed to recall all the previous situations and realized that there was no denying Shion's statement.

"It's possible..."

Hakurou even said the same thing. No, rather, it was only natural to think so. Laplace had said that Yuuki ordered Clayman to keep quiet. Even if the orc riot was unintentional, the subsequent outburst would have gotten him nowhere.

![break]

<<Notice. The situation was redefined based on the newly obtained information. A portion of individual Clayman's actions were unclear, but if Kondou and others intervened, it makes sense. The conclusion is that the Empire is the one that can gain the most profit.>>

![break]

Yes, that's how it should be.

"What does that mean? So we got into trouble because of Kondou's plan?"

"Fuck this."

"You're being vulgar, Benimaru. Change your ways, or I'll tell Shuna-sama."

"Don't do that. I'll change it."

The exchange between Benimaru and Shion went ignored.

"It is frustrating, but I guess I have to agree with Shion's opinion. I also did some criminal psychology analysis for profiling, and there were a few unclear points in Clayman's behavior. He seemed to have been in a hurry to move his army when he should have been more careful. I had overlooked it because of his stupidity, but it would make sense if a third party intervened."

Wow, Diablo's opinion was the same as Wisdom King Raphael-san. Now I had no reason to doubt him.

"Although we don't know the truth, let's assume that Clayman was also manipulated by Kondou. In other words, when you are in contact with Kondou, make sure to be alert to the possibility that you can be manipulated!"

" " "Yes!" " "

Being careful may not even help, but it was better than nothing. Anyway, this Kondou guy was one to watch out for. If we were not careful, he may even be more troublesome than Velgrynd. I made sure that everyone remembered Kondou's face as a common knowledge. Now then, to summarize the strategy...

"Gabil and his men will respond to King Gazel's request for help. But do not fight Velgrynd seriously. Even the leaders will be in danger and the soldiers will die for nothing."

"Yes, sir. Even I would not challenge a great True Dragon."

"Hohoho, we would be no match."

Gabil and Hakurou understood this well enough. The purpose of the reinforcements was to buy time. After we rescued Yuuki, we would deal with Velgrynd.

"But is it okay to leave that ritual alone?" Ultima asked.

By 'ritual', she meant Kagali's 'Dead Birthday' ceremony.

"Don't worry about that. That spell takes a long time to work. It takes at least two hours to produce one. If you try to condense the energy, you will need more time."

Diablo said as such. Less than an hour had passed since the ceremony began. If we met up with Yuuki, defeated Emperor Rudra, and then hurried back...

"That's not the case. Diablo-san is right according to the original method, but Kagali-sama is bein' helped."

"Helped---Oh my. So that's why Velgrynd-sama is cooperating."

Diablo seemed to have understood, but I was not sure what was going on. Still, we didn't have time to listen to the details here.

"So then, how much time do we have?"

"Worst case scenario, a couple of undead elves could be created in two hours."

Two hours, huh? Can we defeat Emperor Rudra in just that much time? No, there was no point in worrying. We just had to do it. I looked at Laplace.

"You're the strongest, right? At the least, you're stronger than Clayman, and you seem to be stronger than the other two guys who specialize in strength."

"Well, I was specially made."

"In that case, let's ignore Kagali's spell."

"Is that okay?" Gabil wondered.

"Yeah. Think about it, Gabil. Laplace is pretty strong, but he's not insurmountable. As for the other two, I think you can beat them, right?"

That was how I saw it. Laplace hid his power, but my eyes could not be deceived. In other words, I sensed that he had not awakened to his Ultimate Skill. Gabil was tough, but Souei should be able to fight him to a tie. In other words, if an undead elf as strong as Laplace was created, it would be troublesome, but if it was weaker than Laplace, it would be no problem. If it grew, they would be a nuisance that couldn't be left unattended. However, I judged that it was not so much of a threat that we had to immediately interfere with them.

"If Velgrynd is assisting with the spell, that's a good thing. If possible, hinder her so that she cannot concentrate. If not, just leave Velgrynd alone. Or rather, we should not actively step on the tiger's tail."

When I said so, Gabil and Hakurou looked at each other and nodded. It seemed that they were in agreement. And then, in case of any emergency...

"If she turns on you or King Gazel, then Ultima and Carrera will just have to deal with her."

They were the strongest of my subordinates, and they would buy us some time against Velgrynd. I could ignore Kagali's ritual, but if Velgrynd made a move, the army would be destroyed. To avoid that, I gave a ruthless order.

"Thanks for relying on me! Even if it's Veldora-sama's sister, I'll show her no mercy!"

"Yeah, we'll see if we can win if we try. I still have an undefeated record, so I'll enjoy it as much as I can."

Ultima and Carrera responded in kind. I would just pretend I never heard about their loss to Zegion. I had finally thought that the plan was decided when something else came up.

"One moment, please. It is not enough for Ultima and Carrera to deal with Velgrynd-sama. I know it's rude of me to offer to show you the way, but I too would like to volunteer to take on Velgrynd-sama."

It was Testarossa's proposal. When I heard this, I felt troubled. The proposal sounded attractive, but if we were to invade the center of the capital, I thought it would be better to attack with our maximum strength. Not only were there powerful opponents whom Guy recognized as strong, there would also be more than four 'Single Digits' as guards. If we were to face such strong opponents, I didn't really want to miss out on Testarossa's battle strength. However, if this would buy time against Velgrynd, it seemed like a good idea. If that was the case, then Gadra would be the best choice...

"I will accompany you instead. It will save time and increase the success rate of the operation."

Souei's offer was a reasonable one. At the very least, it was better than taking Gadra with us. Benimaru, Shion, Souei, and Diablo. With these four, I don't feel like we would lose to any opponent.

"Let's go with that. Then please come with us, Souei."

"Understood!"

Gabil and his team's main objective was to buy time. If possible, they would move to eliminate the enemy forces, including Kondou. In case of emergency, Testarossa and the others would come in. This was the best that could be done at this point.

"Then it's settled. Gabil and the others, take it easy until we get back."

" " "Yes!" " "

Thus, the plan was decided in a hurry.

![break]

At that moment, Vesta, who had been watching the video for a long time, shouted in a hoarse voice, "O-oh! King Gazel has arrived on the scene!"

Hearing him say so, I turned my eyes to the image and saw the Pegasus Knights soaring in the sky.

"Let's hurry. Join up with Gazel and tell him about the plan before they are harmed!"

"Leave it to me! I, Gabil, will take on this great responsibility!"

"Now then, let's get moving!"

I gave the order. And so began the long, long night.

![soft scene break]

After sending Gabil and the others off with the 'transfer technique', my group transported to the capital with Laplace. I had been in human form from the beginning so that I could be ready for anything that may happen.

"We're here. This is our secret base... Hey, where is this?"

We had come here by magic, but there was something wrong with Laplace. It was at that point that I had a bad sense of foreboding. Looking around, I could see a vast hall that did not exist in our country. It was lined with carved pillars, and a luxurious-looking carpet was spread out. It looked like an audience hall of some imperial castle, though I could not help feeling that there was a distorted sense of space.

"Hey."

"N-No, it's not me! I usually only transport to fixed locations. This has never happened before!"

I looked at Laplace impatiently as he answered. It didn't look like he was lying, but if that was the case, what was the meaning of this? I looked around in contemplation and saw a place about fifty meters ahead of us where the ground was elevated with several steps. I could see what looked like a throne, so it appeared to be an audience room. A person of high rank was sitting on a chair, and next to him was a beautiful woman with blue hair. The distinctive chignon was prominent, and Velgrynd herself could not be mistaken.

"Velgrynd! No, she was in the war zone just now, so she can't really be here, right?"

"If they transferred, they could make it in time, but it doesn't look like that."

Benimaru answered my question. He looked puzzled along with Souei and Shion.

"We're surrounded. It seems that this was a trap."

It was Diablo who calmly spoke out. I sensed it too, that there were dozens of people in this hall. They seemed to be quite strong as well.

"Laplace, you bastard. So you really wanted to set us up..."

Despite Souei's sharp tone, Laplace's mind wasn't on it.

"This is ridiculous. Are you saying you interfered with my technique? No way, that's impossible..."

Indeed, he was completely bewildered. Apparently, Laplace had not seen this coming. In my opinion, Laplace did not set up this trap. A man then approached us, making us more cautious.

"Hey, nice work Laplace, I'm glad you managed to fool Demon Lord Rimuru's group."

It was Yuuki. He was dressed in an imperial uniform with a smile on his face.

"B-Boss? W-Wait, wait. What's this all about?"

"Hahaha. You can stop acting. If we can get rid of Demon Lord Rimuru right now...we'll win."

Upon hearing Yuuki's comment, Shion and Souei became furious. However, Benimaru and, surprisingly, Diablo also remained calm and listened to the conversation between Yuuki and Laplace. Seeing this, I was impressed.

<You guys believe in Laplace, too.>

<Ah, no. I was just thinking of a quick way to kill them when they let their guard down.>

<Hey!>

<Kufufufufu, as expected of Benimaru-dono. Kill them before they kill you. It's a fundamental rule.>

What kind of mafioso are you trying to be, you idiots! We don't have those fundamental rules in our country! I was so exasperated that I convinced them to just wait and watch. I also calmed down Shion and Souei, who were in a murderous mood. Meanwhile, Yuuki and Laplace's argument was heating up. Laplace was desperately trying to convince us of his innocence.

"Trust me! I didn't do anything wrong this time!"

Yuuki's move was nothing short of brilliant, because the more desperate he got, the more suspicious he became. I felt sorry for Laplace and decided to end this farce. I patted Laplace on the shoulder and spoke.

"Calm down. That guy is Yuuki, but he's also not Yuuki."

"Huh?"

"Unfortunately, Kondou must be controlling him."

Either Damrada defeated him and manipulated him, or he took him by surprise in the middle of the fight. Whatever the case may be, the fact that there was someone who would control the mind of their enemy was a complication. If I didn't really believe in it, I would have been brought into a fight immediately.

"Oh, so that's it! I mean, it's fun to fool others, but it's really annoying when it happens to me."

Laplace had a good personality. He was cheered up now that he knew I believed him. But that didn't make things any better. We were still surrounded, and we were still in a crisis.

"Damn it, I didn't expect you to see through it so easily. I was hoping to make you more suspicious and let you take it out on your own comrades."

Yuuki too, even when being manipulated, was still a bad character. I guess this was just his nature, so I'd let it slide with a mature attitude.

"Your Majesty, I'm afraid my mission has failed."

"It was a poor sideshow. But oh well. I also wanted to have a few words with them before we began fighting."

When Yuuki spoke to the person sitting on the dais, he got up and started walking. Yuuki quietly moved to the side and gave way. I could conclude from this that Yuuki was now a vassal of Emperor Rudra. Although I could not rule out the possibility that this was an act, I could not be too optimistic. Velgrynd followed behind Rudra. With the exception of her beauty, she looked like an ordinary human being, which was obviously hiding the real information. I could see it. Velgrynd had a thin 'Barrier' around her body and the man walking in front of her. The Barrier was blocking off all signs of aura.

"A great sense of intimidation. I do not believe that this is a fake."

"I agree. It's amazing to see up close."

Benimaru nodded at my words. However, the others reacted differently.

"Is that so? I have also accompanied Veldora-sama in his training, so I feel the same way. Of course, I cannot win."

Shion...so you trained with Veldora too? That means actual combat in the labyrinth. It's the same as fighting for your life, so the results were not to be underestimated. However, if we couldn't win, what was the point? It was neither arrogance nor a sigh of defeat.

"It is indeed a brilliant 'Barrier'. But as Shion says, it doesn't seem to be that much different from Veldora-sama."

Diablo's opinion was also similar to Shion's. Was Velgrynd's evaluation too low or was Veldora's evaluation too high? I was also at a loss to decide. However, even the confident Diablo did not assert that Shion could win. This was important. Diablo, surprisingly, did not lie, and he did not say things that he could not do. That was what I understood.

"I know this wasn't on your agenda, but it would be interesting to have an elite meeting."

Rudra smiled just like Masayuki. His hair color was a shining blonde, and his hairstyle was slightly different. Rudra's eyes were also blue while Masayuki's eyes were brown. There were many differences between them, but for some reason, I got the same impression that they were one in the same. On that note, Masayuki did say something strange.

*'Lately, my hair has been...'*

*'Balding?'*

*'Yes, yes, I've been under a lot of stress---how can that be?! It's just that my hair color has been getting lighter. It was black but now it seems more brownish?'*

*'Hmm. Perhaps you lost melanin pigment, or something like that?'*

*'Is that so? Then I won't be too worried about it.'*

He was just a boy with the usual teenage angst. I had thought so, but now, for some reason, it all came to mind. I was honestly curious, but now was not the time to dwell on it. Rudra was walking right in front of me.

"You're right, we weren't planning on this. However, I did want to talk to you about something."

"That's good. Well then, have a seat."

Rudra waved his hand and two chairs appeared. Was it a magic trick? I didn't know the principle of it at all, but it didn't seem like a trap or anything. This was the kind of time to just focus on the atmosphere. I sat down without hesitation. Benimaru stood to my right, and Diablo took the left side of the table. Shion quickly stood right behind me, and Souei was right next to her. Laplace, who seemed to be out of place, wandered for a moment and then slid in next to Shion's left. Velgrynd's teasing voice came to us after we had settled in our spots.

"Oh, it's not very good etiquette to sit down first!"

Etiquette? I don't know anything about that. I just sat down when you told me to sit down.

"No, Velgrynd, they didn't do anything wrong. As a demon lord, he's in the same position as a leader of a nation. I think we are equals."

His Majesty the Emperor seemed to be speaking from his heart, quite a large vessel.

"If it's okay with you, then I don't have a problem with it either."

Velgrynd was easily convinced. If she really didn't care, then I wish she could have stopped threatening me. Rudra sat proudly in the chair opposite. Velgrynd sat naturally at his right side. One step behind them were Four Knights armed with mythical-grade weapons. These Four Knights must have been the four that Bernie mentioned. Finally, a man in a black military uniform stood on the left side of Rudra. Since he did not look Japanese, I guessed that he was Damrada. Yuuki was standing next to Damrada, making his position clear. I decided to regard him as an enemy.

That said, all of the top officials of the Empire except for Kondou were present here. We had also brought our top leaders, but we were overwhelmingly outnumbered. On the imperial side, there were dozens of top-ranking Imperial Guardians. Moreover, there were even five 'Single Digit' members of the highest rank. In addition, there was Velgrynd, so it was doubtful that we could ever win. On top of that, there was Yuuki.

It was no exaggeration to say that we were in a crisis like never before. From Rudra's words, it seemed that this situation was not Laplace's fault, but rather had been set up from the beginning. Is it always this unsettling to be at the other party's mercy? I put on a fearless attitude and opened my mouth so as not to let them know how I really felt.

"Did I get it this time? We had considered the possibility that you were expecting us, but I didn't expect the situation to turn out like this."

That was a lie. I had thought we were in a position to take the lead, since we had initially been aiming for a surprise attack with an elite force.

"Hahaha, don't be so modest. I didn't expect this either. I had expected that the Armored Corps that I had sent out would be defeated, but I did not calculate that there would be no survivors, and that no one would be awakened."

They had been, but Diablo had beaten them down. I wouldn't tell him this, but I thought that the person who made that plan was pretty good. That being said, it was an outrageous heresy from a human perspective.

"And who planned it?"

I asked him lightly, assuming he wouldn't tell me anyway. Surprisingly, Rudra happily told me himself. According to him...

The plan had been drawn up by Lieutenant Kondou. I was going to say it was as I expected, but the plan was worse than I had imagined.

-   Awaken a few people from the invading army. Then make it look like they've lost.

-   Intercept the pursuing army with the Mixed Corps. However, since there is a possibility that this corps may betray the enemy, it is to be treated as an enemy force.

-   When it is confirmed that they have betrayed the enemy, eliminate them together. The 'Marshal' will be in charge of this task.

At this point in the second phase, the plan had gone awry. Kondou seemed to have made a drastic change in his plan:

-   Yuuki's faction, which had been kept in hiding, was to be intercepted. From the information he had obtained from Demon Lord Clayman, Kondou concluded that Yuuki and his group had definitely betrayed them.

-   Defeat Yuuki's group. Confirm what he was scheming and make final adjustments based on that.

-   The number of Mixed Corps gathered is about 60,000. They will be used as sacrifices to mass-produce majin.

-   At this time, the 'Marshal' will go out to the battlefield and make a showy performance to attract the attention of the Guy and his men.

-   Gather the troublesome ones and beat them at once. For this purpose, the forces should be concentrated in one point.

-   The advantage of a flashy move is that the Imperial City will look thin. There will surely be attackers, and they will surely be elite. We should hit them with our maximum force.

-   Most importantly, it can be assumed that the monster kingdom is also thin, so we should attack with our maximum force, the 'Marshal'. While Guy's eyes are looking in the other direction, we must capture the most powerful piece, the 'Storm Dragon'.

That was the entire plan.

The fact that he had been getting information from Demon Lord Clayman was a sure sign that Clayman had also been under Kondou's control. This clarified what was once only a suspicion. However, that was not the important point. I was surprised that he had disclosed so much information, but I would leave that aside. There was a more important point in what was just said.

A shiver ran down my spine. H-hey, wait a minute. Just how many Marshals---*or Velgrynd's*---were in that plan? It seems that she was in more than one place at a time. I had been thinking it was strange, but Velgrynd should have been rampaging in the Eastern cities of the Dwarven Kingdom, the current battlefield, by now. So then, who the hell is this person in front of me?

![break]

<<Ah! There is a power of an Ultimate Skill that allows one to create a being identical to yourself. That is...>>

![break]

"...'Parallel Existence'?"

I was the one who spoke out Wisdom King Raphael-san's thoughts, hoping that I was wrong. But the reality was very ruthless.

"Oh, so you knew. You're so smart."

Velgrynd's smile was so beautiful and so terrifying. The more one wanted something to go wrong, the more those bad premonitions would come true. We can't win, you know! That's just how I felt. No wonder Testarossa had said she couldn't win by herself. I had been keeping my composure because I had thought I could call Veldora to even the game. Now, however, I realized that I could no longer say such a thing.

According to Wisdom King Raphael-san, 'Parallel Existence' was a very dangerous power. Thinking about it simply, it did not seem to be much different from the 'Clone' which Souei was good at. In Souei's case, he could control multiple 'Clones' at the same time. The 'Clones' were indistinguishable from the main body, and it did not matter how many 'Clones' were destroyed, as long as the main body was safe.

Another foul feature was that the 'Clone' could be split again and again as long as the 'mana' was not exhausted. After all, there was no difference in the physical ability between the main body and the 'Clones', so it was as if there were multiple Souei's. However, I would reveal something here.

This 'Clone' was a tricky thing to control at the same time. It was not a splitting of the consciousness, but rather a 'Telepathy Net' that eliminated the time difference between the two. By adjusting the reaction through 'Thought Acceleration', it only looks like they are moving at the same time without any discomfort. The reason why I didn't use 'Clone' so often was that it was a rather difficult trick. In other words, Souei was a master of the art and had extraordinary senses. I, an amateur, could handle it so well.

And there was one more thing. Although 'Clones' were equal in physical ability, mana was ontological. Therefore, there was a disadvantage in that they could not use all the skills one possessed. This was the reason why Souei's 'Clones' only used the skills with less mana. Therefore, by mastering this condition well, one can discern which one is the main body of the clone. The characteristic of this Skill was that it was not invincible, since the 'Clone' would disappear when the main body was defeated.

However, the following was a very important point. Velgrynd's use of 'Parallel Existence' allowed one to completely split one's consciousness. It could be thought of as the simultaneous existence of multiple entities. In other words, this was a 'Split Body', and even if it was defeated, if any one of the 'Split Bodies' remained, they could then become the main body.

Moreover, there was no need to split the mana. It was as if all 'Split Bodies' were connected to the main body, so they could replenish each other's mana as much as they wanted. That said, since there was a limit to the maximum amount of mana, the total mana of the other 'Split Bodies' including the main body was also reduced by the mana divided. This may be the key to a strategy, but the opponent was a 'True Dragon', which was a race famous for their huge magicule counts. I should have realized that it would be meaningless to use up magicules halfheartedly, since the recovery rate was faster than the consumption rate. To be honest, I didn't know how to beat them. Although I was not Testarossa, I was now being tempted to assert that 'it's impossible to win'. I looked back at Velgrynd and dared to smile arrogantly.

"Well, thank you. I have a great partner. And when it comes to strategy, I won't lose. So, it seems that you think you're leading us into a trap, but can you tell us what you're after?"

In times like these, bluffing was the only way to go. I would show them that I saw through their attempts, and proceed as usual. If I could make them upset and put them on their guard, it would be a win-win situation. However, it did not work out that way.

"How arrogant. You're just like my foolish brother, never admitting defeat."

By 'foolish brother', she was referring to Veldora. With a sister like this, Veldora must have had a hard time. Do you understand Rimuru?---I thought I heard someone say that, but Rudra opened his mouth, so I turned my attention to him.

"Our objective. If you are confident of your intelligence, there's no need to tell you what that is."

Even if you say that, I'm afraid I'm at a bit of a loss. If they wanted to get rid of us, they'd have done it by now. But the fact that we were having this meeting meant that there was room for negotiation. I think the answer we'd get was that they were trying to bribe us.

![break]

<<Answer. Yes. Thinking in that direction is correct. However, there is a possibility that they are stalling for time, in which case, it is assumed that they intend to defeat the individual Veldora Tempest, and welcome him into their side.>>

![break]

I'm not so bad either. I was half right. Indeed, in Kondou's plan, the 'Marshal' Velgrynd had been planning to take Veldora into possession. I had been listening to it because I thought it was impossible, but if there was 'Parallel Existence', wouldn't Velgrynd be heading for the labyrinth right now? Curious, I contacted Veldora via the 'Soul Corridor'.

<Hey...how are you?>

<Idiot, this is not the time! We're in big trouble! Sister...my sister is coming after me. She is currently outside the labyrinth, but if things continue like this, she'll invade!!>

He seemed to be in the middle of a rave.

<Are you gonna be okay?>

<I have no choice but to go out myself. It's better than being attacked inside the labyrinth.>

Veldora would not be defeated by 'Parallel Existence'. I thought as such and gave Veldora permission to fight with all his might.

<I will take full responsibility, so I want you to take care of Velgrynd. Can I ask this of you?>

<Is that all? If that's the case, then just leave it to me! Kuahhahahaha!!!>

<You got it!>

I felt relieved and ended the call. Handing it over to Veldora would be reassuring. I grasped what Rudra was planning. Negotiations resumed.

"Your objective is to win us over. And one more thing. You're meeting with us to stall for time so that we don't interfere with your fight against Veldora, right?"

I answered with a smug look on my face as if to say, 'Well?' Velgrynd looked a little surprised. Then, Rudra smiled happily.

"What a delightful guy. It would be fun to let him compare wits with Tatsuya, but I don't have time to be amused at the moment. If you understand me that well, then we'll talk soon. Come be under my command. I will guarantee that your territory remains untouched and give you the status of Grand Duke."

"Rudra! Appointing an unrelated person as Grand Duke will cause resentment from the other nobles, don't you think?"

"I don't care. If he's willing to cooperate with me, it will be worth it."

The rank above a duke, that was the Grand Duke. Normally, it was a position that only an Emperor's bloodline may or may not be able to hold for one generation, yet Rudra had promised to offer it. From an Imperial point of view, this was an unprecedented favor. I heard that they never allowed the warring nations to surrender, and never even allowed them to be annexed in order to increase their territory.

An Empire that had always expanded their territory through wars of aggression had offered me the highest position in the world. I think it was safe to say that the Empire thought higher of me than I thought. However, even so...

Unfortunately, my answer had long since been determined.

"I can understand that it's a great offer, but the answer is 'no'. Instead, I have a proposal. Why don't we just call it quits and make peace here? I am not asking for compensation or anything like that, but I'd like you to conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression."

It was nothing but a suicidal desire to give a hand to those who didn't care about how many sacrifices would be made by those who served them. Having such naive thinking that one might be an exception was a straight path to ruin. Therefore, I refused Rudra's offer. But more importantly...

I took this opportunity to express my request. As far as I was concerned, no damage had been done, so I wasn't going to ask for an apology. I was willing to let this invasion go as long as they promised not to bother us anymore. I know some people would complain about it, but I thought it would be best if this could be settled without any more bloodshed. I know I am naive, and I understand that promises are unreliable. As long as the other party was untrustworthy, they would break the treaty at some point. But the important thing was to buy time.

By making peace here, we could give each other time to get to know each other. There was a hope that time to deepen mutual understanding would lead to a future in which war could be avoided. If we continued the war in this way, we would only end up where we were currently going. If that was the case, I wanted to take a chance on a small possibility. However, Rudra's answer was cynical.

"After all, you are not meant to be a ruler. You do not understand my mercy, and continue to spin nonsense."

"How arrogant. Rudra just made the biggest concession and you passed it by!"

He had lost an army of a million, but his manner was still that of someone superior. Deep down, he did not actually believe that he had been defeated. He considered the lives of the soldiers lost by his orders as no great loss to him. Rudra was very frightening to me.

"I believe that human beings are creatures that can understand each other. I believe that we can eventually unite into one will and create a better world. For this purpose, it is essential to unify the world by overwhelming force."

Rudra's words sounded similar to the ideals I spoke of. And yet, there was a huge gap that could not be filled. It was very frustrating. The fact that he had come to the opposite conclusion from mine, even though we had started from the same starting point, was proof of this. I was expecting him to be more of an idealist, but that was not the case. Rudra was an autocrat who insisted that his own self-righteousness was absolute justice, with a dictatorial mindset that would not accept any ideas from others. Sure enough, he and I were incompatible. If our arguments were this far apart, it would be impossible to find a solution through discussion.

"We are creatures of free will. There is no such thing as an unchanging justice in the world, and there are many different ways of thinking, aren't there? To refuse to accept that is simply to sow the seeds of conflict."

"Foolish. Only my idea is supreme and just. You must know that you will never reach the ideal world if you continue catering to the selfish whims of fools."

"No matter who it is, there will always be times to make mistakes!"

"I will not deny it. I, too, listen to the voices of my trusted advisors. But it is impossible to hear all the voices of the people. Such an action would only bring disaster to the world."

Well, that may be true, however...

I felt like I could lose in an argument. As much as I hated to admit it, Rudra was much older than me as a ruler.

"Now then, there's no point in arguing here. What I want is your loyalty. Demon Lord Rimuru, give up on Guy and join me."

Recruitment, once again. They're really planning to take on Guy, aren't they? If I chose Rudra here, it would tip the balance, that's for sure. That is why we were being kept alive. But my answer was still the same as before. Now that the negotiations had broken down, it seemed that a fight was inevitable. Velgrynd, perhaps reading my thoughts, smiled coldly and waved her index finger gracefully.

Twice gently. And then, an image appeared in the empty space. It was the same principle as my Argus. The image showed the current battlefield. The image on the screen was...

Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera were lying on the ground before Velgrynd. It was an astonishing sight. Those three girls, who could be considered one of the best fighting forces in our nation, had been defeated by a single being.

"No way!" I muttered to myself.

In the video, Testarossa and the others were standing up again. They seemed to have not lost their fighting spirit yet, but they were still struggling against an insurmountable difference in strength. They can't hold out much longer, I had to admit.

"The primordials you rely on are in such a state before me. Think carefully. I'm going easy on you, as I'm sure you're smart enough to understand."

I knew it was a threat, even if she didn't say so. If Velgrynd wanted to, the others would not be safe either, except for the three demon girls. I didn't know whose intention it was, but Rudra and the others had made the utmost concession to us. After all, Gabil and the others had no time to help the three demon girls. Before they knew it, airships had appeared in the sky over the battlefield, from which the Imperial Army forces had entered the war one after another. On the ground, too, Kondou's forces were present. Yuuki's former comrades, except for Kagali performing the ceremony, were fighting against the army of dwarves.

"Teare! And Footman, too!"

Laplace's shout made me realize that even those nasty masked majins were on the enemy side. It was a close battle, but the situation did not look good. The situation was bad. Benimaru was also worried about me, I could sense it. However, I could not give in at this point.

"I know what you're trying to do. It will be easier to get Veldora to join you if you can get me to go along with it. That guy is a free spirit, and he never obeys the orders of his superiors."

Although, he listens to me pretty well. He gets angry a lot though, so maybe he's just not very good at dealing with me. In any case, that was probably why they wanted me to join. And so, I decided to reject Rudra's invitation. Then, I tried to find another way to look for other compromises---

"We do not wish to negotiate. Take it or leave it. Be clear."

I was suddenly confronted with a choice. If I refused, we would be plunged into a battle in which I had little chance of winning. If I accepted, however, I would be thrown into a battle I did not want to fight. That is, I would be following the will of others instead of my own, which may end up resulting in greater sacrifice.

"You talk about uniting into one will and creating a better world, but is that a world where everyone can live with a smile on their face?"

"What?"

"Even if there is no war, even if there is no starvation, if we are deprived of our free will, what's the point of living? What you are trying to do is to deprive people of their potential! Have you really thought about this properly?"

"Potential? We don't need that kind of thing. If we allow people to be free, they will only go down the path to extinction. It is an act not only against my thoughts, but also against Guy's wish. In that case, isn't it only natural that we need someone to control others so that they do not deviate from the right path?"

"I can understand to a certain extent, and I don't deny it. But is that a world where you can smile?"

What I want to do, in the grand scheme of things, is also to try and manage the human race. But to a certain extent, I also believe that things should be left to the will of man. Overprotection deprives people of the opportunity to grow. I believe that people are stronger than we think, and we don't need to control them from beginning to end.

"Smile? How naive. Whatever the sacrifice, it must be done for the sake of lasting peace. There is no need to ask permission to guide those who do not understand. For the sake of the great happiness to come, some patience will be necessary."

It's not that he wasn't understandable, but that he was incompatible with me. What Rudra was trying to do was not looking at the individual. No matter how I thought about it, it seemed to go against my principles.

"I knew it. Following you will be impossible. I feel that what you're trying to do will only spread more misery. I can't allow you to do that."

"You will be a fool if you do not take the hand I extend to you."

"Then being a fool is fine. Why did you become king? To look like a big shot? Or did you just want to live in luxury?"

"What nonsense. Of course it was for the good of the people."

"You're a liar! I also consider myself a demon lord for the good of all, but I want more people to smile and live. There will be sacrifices, but I'm taking pains to make them as few as possible. I can't think like you!"

I wanted to make the world a better place without any sacrifice, but that was impossible. In the first place, when I became a demon lord, I had sacrificed many people. From my point of view, the other side got what they deserved, and I had no regrets, but the victims' relatives would probably not be satisfied with such an explanation. That was the crime that I would have to bear. Likewise, Rudra should be guilty of a sin that should not be taken lightly. Upon hearing my words, Rudra looked at me with a fiery gaze for a moment. But then, he regained his composure immediately and looked at me while muttering to himself, 'He is young and naive.'.

"Rudra?"

"Don't worry, Velgrynd. It's really been a long time since I've been fervent. I failed to persuade him, but I am convinced that he is too good to be destroyed."

"That's a bad habit, Rudra. Yuuki is there too... I just don't understand your collection addiction!"

"Don't talk about us like we're toys,"---I wanted to complain, but decided not to.

Instead, now that the negotiations had broken down, it was time to prepare for a fight. As I looked around, all of my companions looked ready to go. They seemed to be doing their preparations while I had been speaking with Rudra. I would defeat Rudra here. I was about to open my mouth, having made up my mind. However:

"But it's truly a pity that we failed to persuade Demon Lord Rimuru. And that kid, he's been getting stronger. I was going to punish him a little for not listening to me. But if I'm maintaining 'Parallel Existence', I'm going to give it my all for the first time in a long time."

"Oh? He couldn't be convinced?"

"He won't even listen to me. Well, that's also just like his character."

Unintentionally, I couldn't help but turn my attention to Velgrynd. Veldora was on my mind. I didn't think the invincible 'Storm Dragon' could be defeated, but his opponent was also an unimaginable monster. I was suddenly worried because anything could happen.

"Oh, you're worried about that kid? Then I hope you'll take Rudra's hand. If that's the case, I won't have to torment my cute little brother."

Velgrynd brought up another image. It showed a wounded Veldora fighting against her in dragon form.

"I've been meaning to ask you, how did you manage to tame that one?"

"Huh?"

"I'm asking how you got Veldora to obey you."

No, he doesn't obey me.

"Veldora and I are friends. That's all."

"So then you're not going to tell me. That's too bad."

Velgrynd exhaled, looking genuinely disappointed.

"In that case, I'll show no mercy. That boy, the only thing he has above me is the amount of magicules."

As soon as she said that, Velgrynd disappeared. I was surprised and upset. I knew that Rudra and the others were trying to buy time to defeat and tame Veldora. I understood that, and we were just going along with them because we were also trying to buy time. Velgrynd's 'Parallel Existence' was nearly invincible, but it had its drawbacks. That was the depletion of energy. By eliminating them one by one, you could deplete the divided magicules. Since magicules do not recover immediately, it was possible to weaken the opponent in general.

If the number of divided magicules was small, the user could not perform big moves. Therefore, I thought that Veldora would have an advantage. Judging from the video, Veldora did not seem to be able to defeat Velgrynd's 'Parallel Existence' alone. On the contrary, through 'Soul Corridor', Veldora's impatience could be felt. On the screen floating in the air, Velgrynd, who had been fighting against Testarossa and the others, disappeared. The three demon girls had been trying their best to stall for time, but it all ended in vain. I knew that this was a bad thing. Velgrynd's power was beyond my expectation. She had seen through our intentions and used them in a mocking way...

"Do you mind? Well, I'll give you one more chance after this battle is over. You'll change your mind once you see how foolish you are."

Rudra's voice sounded distant. I felt sorry, but there was nothing I could do about it now. Now that Velgrynd was gone, perhaps it was time to take Rudra down, but for some reason I have a bad feeling about that. And so, I decided to watch Veldora's battle to the end.

In the second image screen Velgrynd left behind, a crimson dragon roared. The clash of the century between the 'True Dragons' would only intensify.
