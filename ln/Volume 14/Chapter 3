# Chapter 3: Capital in|Turmoil

The darkness of the Imperial City ran deep. Thanks to the benefits of scientific civilization, the streets of the Imperial City were now illuminated by streetlights that used natural gas. Even so, there still existed backstreets that were hidden from the public eye. Although the Imperial City continued to develop, it would be a long time before all the darkness was exterminated.

Misha was quietly walking in the darkness of the capital. This darkness was the place where Misha had been born and raised. Rather than fear, she felt a sense of comfort and calmness. This was the woman named Misha. In the days since she reported to Yuuki, Misha has been busy preparing for the coup d'état while hiding in plain sight.

Currently, the Imperial Army was on an expedition. It was dangerous for Misha to go out in such a situation. If she was regarded as a fugitive from the enemy, she would be executed, and in fact, it would not be wrong to do so. Misha, however, was a dignified person, and there was no trace of fear on her face. Misha's confidence in her knowledge of the dark side of the capital was evident in her demeanor. In the first place, Misha was often involved in behind-the-scenes work, but she was also an excellent fighter. Although she was not as good as Vega and Damrada, Misha was also a good leader.

She was a master of intelligence gathering, and she was proud of being superior to the dark side of Dwargon and the intelligence agents of Blumund. Therefore, Misha believed that she could hide from the Imperial Intelligence Agency. In fact, she had survived in the Imperial capital until now. Misha was heading to her destination as usual. But she seemed to have made a mistake. Although Misha had not been careless, a man appeared to block her way.

His name was Tatsuya Kondou. He belonged to the Imperial Intelligence Agency, and was called 'the monster who ate up information'. Although Damrada did not disclose this man's name, it was assumed that he was the leader of the Imperial Guardians. At the very least, Misha was sure that he was an opponent that she could never win against.

"Where do you think you're going at this time of night?"

Kondou's cold voice echoed. Misha smiled in reply, though she inwardly clicked her tongue.

"Oh, isn't this Lieutenant Kondou? Are you working late at night, Lieutenant Kondou?"

On the surface, Misha made a counterattack without hesitation, but on the inside, the situation was undoubtedly the worst.

*He is definitely a monster to have sniffed me out in such a remote place in this spacious capital. I don't think I can win in a fight, and the guards won't be able to buy much time.*

Kondou suddenly appeared in front of her, but it seemed that he was acting alone. Misha was not optimistic about the situation and tried to find a way to escape from the situation.

"You are Misha, the Chief of Staff to the Commander of the Calgurio Corps, right? Why are you back in the capital during the war operation?"

Kondou asked Misha in a very serious tone.

"I was scared, Lieutenant Kondou! Actually, I have received a secret order from Calgurio to return to the capital."

Misha replied, thinking that she could fool him anyway. At the same time, she searched for any signs around her surroundings without any caution. There was no one in the narrow alley. That was fine, but the problem was that the guards had disappeared.

*He's already taken care of them? How much of a difference in ability is there that I didn't even notice any signs of battle?*

In a split second, Misha grasped the situation. Although She and Kondou had not met in person until now, there was no way that he did not know about Misha. It would be difficult to get through this situation with words, though it was still unclear as to how he saw her. Now that the guards had been taken out without question, she should assume that there would be no room for deception. Misha decided to ask for help from Damrada, whom she was scheduled to meet. But then, a bad thought came to her mind.

*How did they know where I was? Yuuki-sama has decided to trust Damrada, but can I really trust him?*

It was Damrada who had designated the meeting place, and today's discussion was to inform the group of the secret meeting with Demon Lord Rimuru scheduled for tomorrow.

*Oh, this is not good. A possibility of Damrada's betrayal---no, I don't think so. I am also indebted to Damrada, not to mention Yuuki-sama's judgment.*

Misha and Damrada had known each other for over twenty years. As the leaders of the secret society Cerberus, she knew more about Damrada than Yuuki did. This was the reason why Misha was so confused. Damrada was a rational man with a cool-headed side. Judging from the information he had given, there seemed to be no reason for him to betray Misha and the others. Not only did Misha want to believe this, but she was convinced by Yuuki's explanation. If this was the case, now was not the time to hesitate, but to trust in her companions to the end. Misha settled her mind and looked at Kondou.

"I thank the great Majesty Rudra for the good fortune of meeting you here."

"Oh?"

"Lieutenant, right? The one who disposed of my pursuers. I thought it would be tough to take on that many men by myself."

"I see, so that's how you want to play this out."

"Oh, am I being suspected, by any chance? I have come back from that hell to deliver the information I have obtained."

Misha continued to perform with aplomb. She flirtatiously walked up to Kondou and leaned against his chest. She would use her charm as a 'Lover' to her fullest to seduce the man. This was Misha's specialty. She used 'Curse perfume' and 'Charm' to influence the target's thoughts. The idea was to make the target captivated by Misha by stimulating their instincts and inhibiting their ability to think. The deeper the mind and body were in contact with each other, the more dependent the subject became with Misha. Once this happened, it would be as if they had been dominated by their partner, just as she had planned.

She had been negotiating with Calgurio, and had almost completed her captivation with him after having made him near her several times. Not just Calgurio, but many other men had fallen for Misha's tricks. For Misha, who had never failed in her career, this was the strongest trump card she could play. Even if the opponent was superior in strength, they would fall before her in the face of carnal desire. Misha was convinced of this and put her supple hands on Kondou's back. She pressed her ample breasts against Kondou and flaunted her charms. Then, she looked for his reaction. Suddenly, she could feel Kondou's attention relax. Misha giggled.

*Fufu, thank goodness. He may look serious, but Kondou is still a man after all.*

The response was more positive than she had expected, and she figured she could make it work.

"Hey, let's go someplace better, okay? Perhaps someplace more private than this...?"

She put her lips close to Kondou's ear and whispered softly. As if in response, Kondou's right hand moved, and a murmur of 'Okay' reached Misha's ear.

*It looks like this is going to work. The best thing to do is to meet up with Damrada at the destination. If that's not possible, then I can find a way to take Kondou, and then we'll be together again...*

That was Misha's last thought. There was a dry thud. Misha crumpled to the ground. Bright red blood flowed from the left side of her head as it bled into the ground. In Kondou's hand was Nambu automatic pistol that he had drawn out without being detected. The smoke rising from the muzzle of the gun asserted itself as the weapon that had shot Misha in the temple.

Kondou did not change his expression and put the gun away as if nothing had happened. The information had already been collected. With his Unique Skill 'Decipherer', he could read the thoughts and feelings of the target he is in contact with. Misha's purpose, Yuuki's plan, and even the fate of the Imperial Army that went on the expedition. It took less than a second for him to decipher all of this information. And even though he had read such important information, there was still no change in his expression. He merely looked bored as he spoke in the darkness.

"---A coup d'état? Foolish. Are you still going to do this and claim that you haven't betrayed His Majesty?"

In the darkness that should have gone unanswered, a man emerged. He did not answer Kondou's question, but instead walked up to the fallen Misha. It was Damrada.

"Kondou, you didn't have to kill her, did you? This person, too, could have been of use to you if you had trained her properly."

"No, there was no chance of that. This woman would have been about thirty-seventh in the pecking order, at best. If she were within the tenth rank, she would still have had a chance, but she wouldn't have been of any use to His Majesty."

"I went to all the trouble of leaving myself defenseless, and she couldn't even get past my defenses," Kondou said coldly.

Damrada heard this and shrugged his shoulders. If Kondou said so, then it must be so, and he agreed without any further rebuttal. He only had mixed feelings about Misha, who had been his companion. Damrada knelt down next to Misha and held his hand to the left side of the body. A soft light sealed the wound. He pushed back Misha's protruding eyeballs and closed her eyelids. Finally, he wiped the dirt from her face, trying to restore some of her beauty. Damrada could not bring the dead back to life, but he at least wanted to let her rest in peace.

"What a waste of time. If we leave her alone, the body will be disposed of before the night is out. Instead, answer my question."

"I'm not like you. I can't separate myself from these things as easily as you."

"How naive."

"You're the one who's weird. At your young age, how can you be so thorough in suppressing your emotions?"

"I have no feelings. That's all there is to it."

"Stupid..."

"I've seen hell. His Majesty Rudra saved me from that hell. If you are planning to be his enemy, I will not tolerate it."

"I am His Majesty's loyal servant. I would never betray him."

"That's hard to say. Remember, you've also fallen in my hands. If you want me to trust you, then prove it with your actions."

With that, Kondou left without looking back. Damrada also took one look at Misha's corpse before leaving. The night was long in the capital. There was still work to be done.

![break]

After that...

Misha's body was disposed of by the men in the Intelligence Bureau without leaving any traces. The darkness of the night was deep in the capital, and the whole event was buried as if it had never happened.

![hard scene break]

Kagali moved immediately upon receiving Yuuki's instruction. In order to execute a coup d'état, careful preparation was essential. A message was sent out that day, and within a few days, the leading figures from all over the world were assembled.

Nearly 30 executives crowded into Yuuki's mansion in the capital. The people they had summoned this time were those who had sworn absolute loyalty to Yuuki. Since some of them, such as Vega, were undercover in other corps and could not participate in the meeting, around half of them were present.

The plan for the coup d'état itself had been in the making for quite some time. The participants in the meeting waited for Yuuki's words with a feeling that the time had finally come. All of them were very capable people. They were all making a name for themselves in the military, relying on their own strength. Their loyalty to Emperor Rudra did not exist from the beginning. Some of them were even excited to bring about a revolution in this country. Visitors from another world. Interracial species who had mixed blood with other races. Experimental subjects who had been repeatedly subjected to atrocious experiments in the pursuit of strength.

Yuuki had trained them to be first-rate adventurers. There were also slave warriors collected by Damrada, and majin protected by Misha. They believed in violence and strength. This was the belief system of the Mixed Corps.

![break]

Up a staircase in a large atrium floor, there was a large room designed for meetings. Yuuki made his entrance n with Kagali just as everyone sat down on chairs.

"Hey, guys. Thank you for coming."

In his usual cheerful tone, Yuuki greeted them with a smile.

"A meeting with Demon Lord Rimuru is scheduled for tomorrow. I have sent Misha to call Damrada, so we will discuss the details when Damrada arrives."

Upon hearing this statement, the audience was in an uproar.

"We aren't doing this on our own?"

"Demon Lord Rimuru is cunning and tricky. Can we trust him?"

"No, wait. That said, we are still at war, aren't we? Demon Lord Rimuru is a faction of the war, so there's no way he could take the time to come here."

The voices were heard from various places in the hall. Yuuki's smile deepened.

"The Imperial Army has been destroyed. It's said that Rimuru-san killed all the 940,000 Imperial troops that invaded the city."

"Nonsense!"

"That's too quick. Based on the travel time, it must have been only a few days since they made contact with the enemy..."

The audience was in an uproar at the unbelievable story. Yuuki laughed and gestured for everyone to be quiet.

"To overthrow an Empire, combat power is necessary. That is why I decided to join forces with Rimuru-san."

Hearing this, some of them begin to understand Yuuki's statement, even if they did not agree with it. Shrewdly, they began to shift their attention towards whether the information was reliable or not.

"Was this information brought back by Misha-sama?"

There were people in the audience who belonged to Cerberus and knew that Misha had served in the military. That is why they asked the question.

"That's right. I think Misha would have been killed too if we had not been allies beforehand."

"Misha-sama?"

"I didn't realize it was that bad..."

Misha was often behind the scenes, but she was well known. The name of Cerberus was not just for looks. Because only meritocrats are present here, they gave due credit to their colleagues. In a strange sense, they had a lot of trust in Yuuki because they did not value those who could not meet their expectations.

"I see. In that case, I am in favor of the alliance. Although I am not happy about the concealment thus far, I'm sure the boss had his own reasons for keeping quiet about it."

"It's not so much a theory. It's just that Guy beat me to it and forced me to make a promise."

"Guy? Don't tell me it's Guy Crimson?!"

"Did you fight the Lord of Darkness? Boss, you are too reckless!"

"No way. I'm surprised you survived."

The audience was in an uproar in a different sense, but Yuuki silenced them once again.

"I know you have a lot to say, but I don't have time to explain it. I'd rather discuss the arrangements for tomorrow's meeting and how to proceed with the operation."

The only official forces remaining in the capital were the Intelligence Bureau and the New Legion. Although the top-level officials of the Intelligence Bureau might be a threat, the lowest-level officials need not be counted in the strength of the forces. The New Legion, though numbering as many as 100,000 men, was too weak to be a threat. They were not troublesome in terms of strength, but merely troublesome due to their numbers. There were about 20,000 other guards stationed in the city in place of the police, but they were no match for the military in terms of equipment. The difference in strength between the military and the police was so great that it was akin to making adults deal with children. At best, they could only serve to stall for time. However, the Emperor still had the strongest force in his hand, the Imperial Guardians.

"The Intelligence Bureau also has a royal guard in its midst. So, strictly speaking, it is only the near guard that we should really be wary of."

"Indeed. They've been hit with a few rank battles, but the top ones are really strong."

"Oh, come on, you're just boasting. There are also traitors like you amongst the royal guard."

"Well, I guess so. I believe only in power, and I have no allegiance to the Emperor who only shows himself off."

That was where the laughter came in. Three were people of their own among the Imperial Guard. By reaffirming this fact, they realized how much of an advantage they were in. The man who started this trend was a little small but with an arrogant attitude. His name was Arios. Although he was an otherworlder, he was not a summoner, but a wanderer.

"So, will Demon Lord Rimuru's reinforcements be ready by tomorrow?"

A dark-haired girl asked Yuuki a question. Mai Furuki, an otherworlder. She was a Japanese high school girl who had been summoned to this world. Mai had been picked up by Yuuki, who was the grandmaster, and he had helped her in various ways. Because of this, she trusted and admired Yuuki.

"That's right. If they're coming with an army, it's going to take them a long time no matter how fast they go. If they're flying, they won't actually come then, will they?"

As if to cover Mai's question, a large muscular man spoke up. His name was Torneot, who was once a slave fighter. If Damrada had not found him, he would have been a slave in the mines to this day. Torneot had been thrown into the army, educated, and soon discovered the joy of learning. That is why he was apparently well-informed and held the position as a general staff officer in the Mixed Corps.

"Flight magic is extremely psychologically draining. It may be okay for demon lords, but it doesn't necessarily mean that even the other monsters can do it."

Agreeing with Torneot was a small girl. Her name was Aria, a wizard and a heavy warrior. Her appearance did not match her age, and she was a unique person who had undergone remodeling surgery on herself while she was an apprentice of Master Gadra. Torneot replied to Aria with disgust.

"Not just that. There's a surveillance net over the capital too. If they come in from the sky, they'll be noticed even if they land far away."

Aria's face turned red and she felt ashamed of herself when she was told a surprisingly accurate point. Aria was unusually short-tempered and thoughtless for a wizard.

"All right, all right, it's important to have different opinions. Analyzing things from different angles helps us to see things from various perspectives."

Yuuki quickly interceded and pulled the agenda back on track.

"Rimuru-san has contacted me through old man Gadra and said that only a few people are coming tomorrow."

The contact with Rimuru was made through 'Magic Communication', which Gadra kept secret. Even if the Imperial Intelligence Bureau had intercepted the message, it would have been impossible to decipher it because it was encrypted. Gadra only communicated the gist of the message, but he had not yet decided who would go to the meeting. If Rimuru was confirmed, who would be the escort?

*It seems that Rimuru-san has decided that there is no point in making a demonstration against Rudra. They are going to ensure quality rather than quantity, and I am sure that only the executives will come to Rudra.*

Yuuki estimated that there would be at most about ten people.

"That...is that them underestimating the Empire? Or are they mocking us as allies?"

A slender and beautiful woman, twisting her body gracefully, tilted her head and asked a question. It was not so much a question rather than an expression of her thoughts. The seemingly natural-looking woman was a warrior named Orca. In contrast to her appearance, she was an extraordinary person with a number of hidden skills.

"Orca, that's not true. As I said before, a large army takes time to prepare, and everything takes time. I think they decided it was better to go with a small elite force."

Once again, Torneot provided an explanation. Yuuki smiled at him as if he had just saved him a lot of trouble.

"That's right. That's why we need to set up our own plans."

Rimuru would arrive with only the best of the best---the question was, who would deal with whom?

"We will hear what Rimuru-san thinks at tomorrow's meeting. That's why we need to put our thoughts together. For example, what to do about Emperor Rudra."

Yuuki's statement could be seen as arrogant. He was looking only to a future where he was the winner, not to a future where he had lost. It was unusual for him to be discussing the treatment of the Emperor before the coup d'état had even started. However, no one pointed this out. Even Torneot, who has the tendency to poke and prod, smiled and was ready to wait for Yuuki to speak.

"The Dwarven Kingdom is aware of the situation. That's why the Mixed Corps forces that are currently deployed can also launch themselves toward the capital without worrying about their own backs. If only the forces remaining are in the capital, it should be a piece of cake, right?"

"Yes, indeed. So the only threat is the Imperial Guard?"

"I suppose so."

Yuuki responded with a smile. In truth, he knew that the real threat lied elsewhere. There was an unknown entity known as the Marshal. And if one considered the meaning of Guy's decision to let Yuuki live...

*Why did Rimuru-san move this time? He is normally a pacifist who hates to initiate attacks on other countries...*

Perhaps it was to avoid any regrets, however, he could not help thinking that this was not the only reason. Yuuki then put the pieces together one by one. Then, he imagined the shadow of Guy appearing behind Rimuru. If that was the case, he could only come to the conclusion that there was a monster in the Empire who could be Guy's opponent.

"Depending on the circumstances, it is inevitable to kill the Emperor, right?"

"You're getting ahead of yourself, Arios."

"That's right. It's not good to take all the credit."

Those gathered were excited, and some of them even began to talk about the Emperor's murder, or the murder of his people. Yuuki thought that it was too early to talk about the Emperor's fate, but he reminded himself that it was a good thing to be so full of vigor. In fact, the treatment of Emperor Rudra would be discussed in tomorrow's meeting. Gadra was against killing him, and Damrada's loyalty was to Emperor Rudra. Since these two men were important collaborators, Yuuki did not want to make a bad impression on them. Before that, there was a high possibility that Emperor Rudra was the one whom Guy was worried about. If so, it would be suicidal to make a move against him.

*Let's just wait and see. There's no need to take the risk of picking up chestnuts from the fire. I'll just hand the Emperor over to Rimuru-san.*

Yuuki made his conclusion. The details of the meeting would be discussed after Damrada's arrival, but they now had a rough outline. The main body of the Mixed Corps would take control of the Imperial City. The Imperial Guard, who would be in the way, would be taken care of by those present here. The men Yuuki had selected here were as good as any Imperial Knight in terms of ability. Although they were not as good as the elites, they had an advantage in numbers.

If several players were to challenge one person, it was possible to overturn such a gap in strength. The opponents of monsters such as Rudra and 'Marshal' could be left to Rimuru, who had taken the trouble to participate in the battle. Since Rimuru was probably planning to do so anyway, this proposal was expected to be accepted. No reinforcements would come from anywhere to defend the capital.

Of the three major corps, the Armored Corps was destroyed by Rimuru. The Magic Beast Corps was far in the sky. Even if they rushed to the defense as soon as they knew the situation, all the battles would have been settled by then. The last of the legions, the Mixed Corps, had defected.

Now that the plan had been advanced to this point, they were in a position to win the game. The victory was close at hand with no need to rush. However, Yuuki could not shake off the uneasy feeling that he had overlooked something. What was it that he was missing...?

"Thank you for your patience."

A calm voice echoed in the heated hall. Upon hearing his voice, everyone shrank back as if they had been doused with cold water.

"At last, Damrada."

The man---Damrada---had arrived at the venue.

![soft scene break]

Damrada was not wearing his usual disguised merchant uniform, but rather, unusually, an imperial military uniform. At that point, Yuuki felt uncomfortable.

"What happened to Misha?"

"She died."

The hall fell silent. Everyone felt a sense of disquiet and was on the verge of war. Those of them who were there had been through a number of such situations, so they were sensitive to such signs.

"What do you mean, Damrada?"

"It's just like I said. Misha was killed by Kondou."

Upon hearing this, Yuuki felt the lingering lump in his chest disappear. He had felt uneasy, as if he had overlooked something. And now he realized that he had finally found out what it was. The relationship between Yuuki and Damrada, though not long, was very deep. They had shared a countless number of wrongdoings that could not be revealed to the public. It was with Damrada's help that Yuuki had been able to destroy Echidna, which had controlled the underworld of the Empire. After that, he had established the secret society Cerberus and kept working for it as its leader.

Yuuki had thought so, but it seems that he had been mistaken. Everything had gone as the Empire wanted it to go. The secret society Cerberus was an organization led by the people Damrada had gathered. Its purpose was to sort out the talented from the incompetent. They had been searching for the best and the brightest by spreading information networks all over the world. Protecting strays was a part of that.

This was not a recent development. It had been happening for a long time, ever since the days when Echidna had been on the rampage. In this way, it was possible that Yuuki himself must have been one of those very people who were discovered by Damrada. They found the strong and brought them onto their side. It was Yuuki who had caught the eye of Damrada, who had been moving along with such a goal.

Damrada himself would be too conspicuous if he appeared in the public. Yuuki was chosen to be nothing more than a stand-in. In other words, he had been used by the people who he thought he was using. That being said, this did not mean that Damrada had betrayed them. Damrada's loyalty was genuine. Someone was manipulating Damrada to make him trust the naturally suspicious Yuuki, and this answered the doubts that he had been feeling. Realizing this, Yuuki let out a sigh of disappointment.

"I've been fooled. Since when was it?"

"...? What are you talking about?"

Damrada replied in an indifferent manner. It was the same tone of voice as usual, but it made Yuuki feel that something was definitely off. He was not pretending to be confused, but rather was sincerely unable to understand what was being said. This meant that Damrada himself was unaware that he was being manipulated.

*No wonder I didn't realize it. If he was unaware of it, there is no way I could detect it.*

Thinking this way, Yuuki recalled the last time they had talked. At that time, Damrada insisted that he had not betrayed them. He felt that he was sincere, and in fact, it was possible that he might have done something after that. If Yuuki believed his intuition, it felt to him that Damrada had only been manipulated recently.

*That's right. I am the one who decided to believe in Damrada. I'm not going to say much about that at this point, but the important thing is the purpose of whoever sent Damrada here.*

There was someone controlling Damrada. This was a definite fact in Yuuki's mind, and if he took that into consideration, he could guess that their current situation was very severe. The siege against Yuuki and his group would be completed even as they were dealing with Damrada. Yuuki became lost in his thoughts. Beside him, Kagali was quietly analyzing the situation. However, the energetic young people in the hall were agitated by Damrada's attitude.

"Damrada, you are being disrespectful to Yuuki-sama!"

Aria condemned him. Torneot then asked him what was going on.

"Damrada-san, what are you thinking? Are you planning to betray us?"

"Betrayal? That's a curious thing to say," he replied aloofly. "My allegiance is unwavering and dedicated to His Majesty Emperor Rudra from beginning to the end."

"Che, that's called betrayal!"

Arios spat out fiercely Damrada was famous for being dirty with money and was looked down upon by some of his friends. Because Damrada was such a person, many of them were more angry than surprised at this situation. The first to make a move was Torneot. He grabbed Damrada by the neck with one hand and spoke threateningly.

"Don't be so damn coy! You got me. You were the one who said I should live for the cause rather than die a slave in the mines. I was grateful to you. So why are you doing this?"

Torneot's actions were actually to protect Damrada. He was trying to find a way to get out of this situation before others made a move. However, for Damrada, this seemed to have been an afterthought. Damrada gently squeezed Torneot's wrist back, manipulated the flow of force, and in turn restrained him.

"Torneot, do you remember what I said?"

Damrada's eyes were so cold that they chilled the calm Torneot to the core.

"Wh-what?"

Torneot answered while holding his wrist.

"Didn't I teach you back then to be strong for the cause? Is this all you've got?"

Torneot's wrist crunched as all the forces converged on a single point. And just like that---it shattered.

"Ah, my wrist, in an instant..."

Groaning and rubbing his wrist, Torneot moved away from Damrada. He took out a restorative he had on hand and healed himself. Damrada stood calmly, not bothering to attack Torneot. He was not letting his guard down in the slightest. In this world where some monsters could heal a broken bone in an instant, one must not let their guard down until they have neutralized their opponents. Without such an awareness, one could not survive in this world.

Yuuki's eyes narrowed as he watched Damrada. He knew Damrada was strong. Since he was in the top of the Single Digits, it was no wonder that he was stronger than the others gathered in this room. The important thing was whether or not he had an Ultimate Skill. And, also, to what extent he was being manipulated.

*In the end, the real question is whether my 'Anti-Skill' will be able to disarm it or not.*

Depending on that, Damrada would have to be killed. Yuuki deliberately did not stop his companions in order to find out.

"So you were just the Emperor's dog. I had thought you were just a money-grubber, but I was fooled. Even so, to come in here and expose yourself all on your own, it was a foolish act...unlike your usual cowardice!" Arios shouted, and that was the start of the situation changing.

"That's right, Damrada-san. I have been in your debt, so I'm going to kill you myself in a way you won't have to suffer."

Torneot, now in full swing, challenged Damrada with all his might.

"Too slow."

Torneot swung his mace with both hands, but Damrada dove past the mace with ease. With a natural movement, he drilled into Torneot's chest, gently pushing out his left palm. A heavy impact hit Torneot, not indicative of the lightness of his movements.

![full page image](image7)

Spiral penetration break---a technique that forces one's fighting aura into the opponent's body. The fighting aura penetrated through armor and muscles and destroyed the target from the inside. Its power was proportional to the amount of fighting energy, and Damrada's spiral penetrating attack would be a killing blow that could surpass the power of a tank gun. Torneot could not withstand it.

"Goof!"

He vomited blood and cried out, cowering in place. He tried to stand up, but his legs were weak. Of course they were. Torneot's internal organs had been destroyed by the blow.

"I-I didn't know...you were this strong..."

"Well, well, well. To judge a man by his looks is the haughty pride and arrogance of the strong. Perhaps, because I hired you as my bodyguard, you mistakenly thought that you were stronger than me?"

"Kuh."

"I told you to be strong and not look down on people. Even if one does not rely on a Skill, they can still get stronger with training. Just like me."

As soon as he said this, Damrada shot backward with a spinning back kick without looking back. The assailant who had aimed at Damrada from behind was unable to react to the kick, and was killed instantly with his neck broken. He was killed too easily, but it was still Arios who had been one of the strongest people whom Yuuki had recognized.

Arios had the Unique Skill 'Murderer', and also possessed the 'Silent Movement' and 'Presence Concealment' abilities---all traits that made him suitable for assassination missions. It was a skill structure that specialized in killing, and he had been a man worthy of the forty-fourth rank. It was expected to be a battle favorable to Arios, but Damrada had easily buried him.

"It is not enough to rely on Skills. The only thing you can rely on in a critical moment is your own body and spirit that you have trained. In my opinion, you are useless."

Damrada's words were harsh. Those who had never been mocked even by their instructors in the art of war were outraged to hear them. They were furious at Damrada's words, which sounded like a warning to the weak. All of them became fretful and unleashed their murderous intent on Damrada. Under such circumstances, Yuuki was calmly analyzing the situation. He came to a conclusion.

*I knew it. Damrada did not betray us. He's being manipulated by someone. Arios was an Imperial Guard, so he may have been on the Emperor's side. The fact that he did not kill Torneot and didn't go easy on Arios is evidence of that. In other words, he still has some of his free will, but he can't do anything that is detrimental to his ruler, right?*

It must be a very powerful controlling force that was manipulating Damrada. Yet Damrada was trying to get through to Yuuki somehow. Yuuki followed his judgment and came up with the optimal solution.

"All right, everyone pay attention! Right now, let's move to the retreat! I give full authority to Kagali, and you will join up with the Mixed Corps as fast as you can."

"Boss? We don't have to run away. We'll deal with the traitor, and then we'll go right back up..."

"No."

Yuuki rejected Aria's proposal in a single word. He smiled with a comfortable expression as usual, but his eyes looked around all of them seriously.

"Damrada is just trying to buy time. That is why he's explaining at length, because that is what's still allowed, right?"

"'Allowed', you say?"

Kagali asked. Nodding his head, Yuuki answered definitively.

"That's right. Damrada is not betraying us. He's being manipulated. And then he's going to exterminate us right here."

The reactions to Yuuki's words were varied, but they seemed to have the effect of restoring calm judgment to his fellow workers. They suppressed their killing intent toward Damrada and focused their attention on his second-in-command, Kagali. Kagali's judgment was similar to that of Yuuki's. Her instincts were ringing alarm bells, and Kagali knew that she was in a critical situation. When Yuuki gave her the instructions, Kagali understood what she had to do. The situation was urgent. Kagali, who had no time to argue with Yuuki's instructions, took action.

"We're abandoning this site and heading for the Mixed Corps encampment."

"But what about Yuuki-sama?"

"Don't worry about me. I don't think Damrada will let me go, so I have to deal with him."

"So go," Yuuki said, turning his back on everyone and confronting Damrada.

"Let's go."

" " "Understood!" " "

Everyone knew what they had to do. Whether Damrada was a traitor or not did not matter anymore. Just by watching Yuuki's back, they came to an understanding. They, who were strong, understood that what they needed to do now was not to argue with each other, but to try their best to survive. Aria carried the fallen Torneot. While it was funny to see a small girl carrying a big man on her back, no one laughed at her. The wielder of the healing spell healed Torneot and joined the back of the group. And then, in an orderly fashion, they departed into the darkness of the night.

A few minutes later. Yuuki and Damrada were the only ones left in the large conference room.

"Even if you run now, it will be too late. You were always too late. Yuuki-sama underestimated the intelligence bureau."

"Maybe. But if you persist, you might be able to find a way out of it, right?"

"Ridiculous. This is not child's play."

"Of course. I'm always serious."

"Along with your dream of world domination?"

"Of course! And you're the same way too, aren't you?"

Hearing this, Damrada laughed as well.

'Yes, that's right,' he said with deep satisfaction.

![break]

Yuuki Kagurazaka was a good master to Damrada. He had a cool-headed side to him, even though his thoughts were still childish at times. He was very calculating and never bored Damrada. That is why Damrada trusted Yuuki. He thought that Yuuki would realize that he was being manipulated by Kondou.

.........

......

...

Damrada's loyalty to Emperor Rudra was real. He admitted this to Yuuki, but it was nothing to Rudra. In the first place, the two were not even comparable. Emperor Rudra was everything to Damrada. And Damrada was acting in accordance with his promise to Rudra. Fulfilling that promise was the purpose of Damrada's life. Damrada had known Rudra longer than Kondou. Therefore, it was undeniable that Kondou would also be careless enough not to touch Damrada.

He was aware of his suspiciousness, and therefore he was cautious, but Kondou seemed to be a more dangerous man than Damrada had thought. Soon after he said farewell to Misha, Damrada's will was put under Kondou's control. The method was unknown, but Damrada was unable to break it by any means. Damrada's consciousness remained intact, but Kondou had taken control of all his actions.

.........

......

...

*Kondou, I never thought you could manipulate me as well. That guy is very cautious, but I didn't think he would go this far. Even so, as expected of Yuuki-sama.*

Since he could not disarm this by his own strength, the only hope left was to rely on Yuuki. This meant that Damrada needed to make him aware of the situation, which was a very difficult task. It was very difficult for Yuuki to be made aware of Damrada's situation because he seemed to be betraying them by all intents and purposes. Damrada himself had been about to give up, thinking that it would be impossible to make people believe in him. However, Yuuki recognized it beautifully. Damrada was moved by this fact and said only what Kondou allowed him to say.

"Yuuki-sama, as Deputy Commander of the Imperial Guardians, I will show you what the second rank in the pecking order is all about!"

This rule was by permission only, and restrictions were placed on Damrada's actions. Despite this situation, Damrada attempted to pass on as much information as possible to Yuuki. One of them was to give him his title. If Yuuki knew all the information that could be given to him, he would be able to make use of it as he liked. Damrada was convinced of this and intended to leave the rest to Yuuki.

*All that is left is for Yuuki-sama to kill me. Yuuki-sama will fulfill the promise to His Majesty Rudra. It is a pity that I cannot see it with my own eyes.*

Damrada was sure that Yuuki would succeed in inheriting his will, because in order for Yuuki to fulfill his ambition, he had to fulfill Damrada's will as well. Damrada did not hold out on expectations that were too high.

"Don't worry. There's still a lot of work to be done. I will help you."

"Hah! Saying such naive things won't help you defeat me."

The joyful feelings that welled from his heart could not be extinguished, even if he was being manipulated. Damrada unleashed his emotions to his heart's content...

![hard scene break]

More than thirty warriors ran wildly down the main street of the capital. Under Yuuki's orders, Kagali and the others attempted to escape from the capital at night to meet up with the Mixed Corps. The location where the Mixed Corps was encamped was near the border of the Dwarven Kingdom. It was about 500 kilometers to the southwest of the capital, a distance that would take a peddler more than ten days to travel.

A person with high mana could use the 'portals' that stretched around the capital. It was the result of a superior magical technology that enabled them to travel between the cities in an instant. However, it was not something that could be used by a hundred people at once, and since it was an important facility, it was heavily guarded. It was obvious that barging in at this late hour of the night would lead to a fight.

Kagali, without any hesitation, chose to go on her own. She decided that the first priority was to prepare her forces, rather than to start a dispute here. In this group, everyone was a superhuman beyond the level of normal human beings. If they keep running without a break, they could reach the destination in a few hours.

"Is Kagali-sama okay?"

"Yes, there's no problem. Thanks for your concern, Teare."

Kagali thanked Teare, the masked girl running beside her. Kagali was an ex-demon lord who wandered around in a spiritual body for decades after being defeated by Demon Lord Leon. At that time, Kagali---Demon Lord Kazalim, who was not a spiritual body, had to do his best just to maintain his own ego. Overcoming such a past, he finally got a homunculus body thanks to Yuuki. And without any problem, he had been training it powerfully. So now, he had acquired the fighting ability comparable to that of a greater majin. Even in the midst of this group of strong men, she was not lagging.

"Yeah? Well, that's good. I just wish Laplace was here at this point..."

"Yes, Laplace could have won against Damrada."

"Hohoho. The boss is strong too. He will surely come back to us with a victory!"

"Yes!"

"Yes, you're right."

Kagali smiled as she answered, but she was also aware of the growing impatience inside her. The alarm bells had been ringing nonstop since a few minutes ago, and Kagali's anxiety was getting bigger and bigger.

*---Not good. This is not good.*

It was an instinctive intuition, but she didn't know how many times it had saved her life. Therefore, Kagali knew that something had to be done, even if there was no evidence to support it. She turned her attention to Teare and Footman, the people she trusted the most.

"Call Laplace."

"What?"

"Tell him to come back."

Teare and Footman could communicate with Laplace by 'telepathy'. No matter how far apart they were, the clowns were connected to each other.

"Laplace is on his way as the messenger..."

"I don't care. Hurry up!"

The alarm bells that only Kagali could hear were getting louder. There was no time for explanations. Judging that there was no time to explain, Kagali left Teare alone and tried to give her next order.

"Everybody, spread out from here! Use your own judgment and put survival first."

She was not able to say a word until the end, telling them to join the Mixed Corps. She realized that it was already too late.

"---That's amazing. I thought I had completely covered my tracks, but I'm surprised you noticed."

With these words, a man in military uniform emerged from the darkness. It was Lieutenant Kondou. Not just Kondou, but also others descended soundlessly from the roofs of the buildings facing the main street, one after another. There were about fifty of them. However, they could feel an overwhelming presence from each and every one of them.

"Imperial Guardians..."

"That's right. Stop your futile resistance and surrender. Then you will have the honor of dying for the Emperor."

"Yes, I'll admit it. Lieutenant Kondou, you are the Commander of the Imperial Guardians."

Kondou kept his expression blank even after being pointed out. He neither denied nor confirmed it, but that was enough for Kagali. Kagali and the others were crowded near the knights who stood in a circle around them. Now that the situation had come to this, a battle was inevitable. The Imperial Knights were fully armed with legendary-grade weapons. Even though they were equal in strength, there was a big difference in equipment. Although they were at a huge disadvantage, none of Yuuki's subordinates would give up at this point.

"Hah, let's do this! It'll save us a lot of trouble!"

"That's right. Let's see what the Imperial Guardians can do!"

Torneot, who had almost died a few minutes earlier, threw up a flare, and Aria took advantage of it to make a big show. As if she had supernatural power, she had no intention of admitting defeat without doing anything. Kagali was trying her best to analyze the situation. The probability of everyone's survival was close to zero. The tactical victory goal at this point was to have as many people join up with the Mixed Corps.

In order to do so, they needed to stall for time. Until Yuuki defeated Damrada. Until Laplace came back to help. Buying precious time---this was Kagali's mission.

*Well, I hope one of you can make it, but we'll see what happens.*

With this in mind, Kagali stepped forward to Kondou.

"Huh? You're going to be my opponent?"

"Yes. Let's see how powerful the head of the Imperial Guard is."

Kagali replied, but she knew that she was not as good as Kondou. Kagali's goal was to use herself as a decoy.

*If winning is impossible, then at best, we can buy time...*

With this determination, she took a stance towards Kondou. Kondou, on the other hand, seemed to have no interest in Kagali. He sighed in frustration at the battle that had begun around him.

"I hate useless work. I'm not going to play along with your stalling tactics, and you should understand that you can't win a war with mental will."

"What do you think? I was hoping that if I prayed, a miracle might happen."

"Hmph, ridiculous. An ex-demon lord talking in his sleep."

Hearing this, Kagali also gives a click of her tongue. Only a few of her friends were supposed to know about her original identity as an ex-demon lord. Kondou had revealed it so easily. In other words, he had judged that such information was a trivial matter.

"You're underestimating me."

"No, I don't think so. I'll tell you something else. You're trying to join up with the Mixed Corps, but it's no use. The Emperor himself has already organized a strike force."

"I beg your pardon?"

It was an unusual situation for the Emperor to go to war. But Kagali's concern was with the word 'strike force'.

"Of course, only the strong matter. In the first place, whether or not people are loyal to His Majesty Rudra matters, because we have no need for small fry who have no chance to awaken."

"What kind of..."

"Don't you understand? You are alive today only because there remains the possibility of evolution. Everything is going according to His Majesty Rudra's plan."

"What nonsense! Are you trying to say that our plans have all been seen through?!"

Kagali was incensed. Kondou took one look at Kagali as if unamused.

"That's a foolish question. Did you really think you were deceiving my eyes here in the capital?"

A faint flame of emotion lit up in Kagali's heart. The name of that emotion was humiliation. With the Unique Skill 'Schemer', Kagali had been making various plans and succeeding in them. Despite her continuous failures because of Rimuru, Kagali was proud of being Yuuki's schemer and his strategist. Kondou scoffed at her.

"How could a human..."

"You mean Yuuki Kagurazaka, right?"

With a blood-curdling rage washing over her, Kagali felt as if her eyes had gone blank. Even so, she also saw that this was part of Kondou's plan. If she let her emotions get the better of her in anger, she would lose a battle that could have been won. As proof of this, Footman, perhaps provoked by Kagali's anger, attacked Kondou as if he had lost all reason. Footman, who boasted the greatest offensive power among the clowns, was firing extremely large mana bullets without any concern about destroying the city.

Kondou dodged the attack, but an alarm sounded in the city, and it seemed as if a big commotion was about to break out. At this rate, not only Kondou's group but also other guards and onlookers would rush to the scene. Now that this had happened, there was no need for Kagali and the others to be concerned. They should regard anyone who disturbed them as an enemy and kick them out. However, she was sure that Kondou and the others were well aware of such a situation. In that case, why were they tolerating the current situation? That was Kagali's question.

*Settle down, and think calmly. He's just trying to make me angry...*

Since she knew what Kondou was planning to do, she would just have to go along with Kondou. Thinking of this, Kagali stifled her anger. She suddenly felt uneasy, as if she had overlooked something serious.

*Wait...? Damrada was being manipulated by someone. If it was Kondou---*

Not only Footman, but also Teare was taking part in the battle. Around them, the Imperial Guardians and Yuuki's companions were fighting each other to a terrible extent. Kondou did not change his stance even in such a situation. Before she knew it, Kondou was holding a pistol in his right hand and a sword in his left to deal with the situation. Footman and Teare, the two majin who were more powerful than demon lords, still maintained their composure.

![full page image](image8)

Although she had expected him to be strong, this was more than expected. Without a doubt, he was stronger than Damrada. Kagali felt this way, and realized once again how scary Kondou was. Kondou only held up his gun and did not show any sign of shooting it. He was fighting Footman and Teare with only his sword.

The sword was, in Kagali's eyes, a great sword. In fact, unbeknownst to Kagali, the sword was made in the style of a naval sword, but the blade was a beautiful work of art with a lovely blade pattern that fascinated any who saw it. It was a family heirloom that had been passed down in the Kondou family for generations, and was not a cheap item that an amateur would be able to own. Naturally, it was not a weapon to be handled with one hand. Nevertheless, Kondou handled it with only one hand, gripping the lower part of the handle with his left hand. This was an ordinary style, and it was obvious to onlookers that he had not been showing his true ability.

*This man is dangerous. Taking on those two as opponents, but not fighting seriously... So why? If he wanted to kill them, he could have taken them more seriously. If he isn't doing that, does he think we'll be of some use to him? I guess that's...*

And then Kagali arrived at the answer. Kagali shouted.

"Watch out! Kondou may be able to manipulate others in some way!"

"Ho, you're right."

Kondou did not deny it and instead admitted it honestly. Kagali thought this was strange.

*This man revealed his hand? No, there's no point in denying it, since we already suspect him. On the other hand, if he affirms it, it will make us more cautious, so I don't understand. Why did he...*

Kagali was skeptical. She could not understand Kondou's thoughts and could not see what the right thing to do was. Since she could not win by fighting, it would be best to follow the original strategy of stalling for time. That's what she thought, but she couldn't understand why Kondou was going along with this strategy.

*No, this is strange! How can this guy say he doesn't want to help us stall for time, but---ah! Oh, that's right, that's right!*

Kagali finally realized how scary Kondou truly was. She realized that each conversation had a meaning, and that he had completely controlled the flow of the conversation by interweaving lies.

"You're stalling for time as well..."

"You finally figured it out? I'm the one who's been playing along with your stupid stalling games."

"Kuh."

"It is easy to decipher what you think."

Even though she tried to keep her cool, Kondou's provocations irritated Kagali.

"I'll tell you what to think..."

"Do you know why they call me 'the information monster'?"

"..."

"You said it yourself earlier, didn't you? That I can control others. Then why didn't it occur to you that it would be easy for me to gain the knowledge of those I manipulate?"

What is he talking about?---Kagali wondered. It would be too childish if this was a lie, but if this was true, it would be tantamount to divulging important secrets. It was hard to believe that this careful man would do such a thing as reveal his own hand.

"What a pain in the ass. It's not like I have all the answers myself. I was planning on making contact with you guys when I got out to the city. I'm not happy about the damage to the capital, and it's a hassle to deal with you in this way."

"You're holding back?"

"Hohoho, we've been underestimated!"

In response to Kondou's words, Teare and Footman were enraged. It was just a trick of their opponents, and in this case, it was a bad move. Kagali was impatient because she understood this.

"Calm down, you guys! Don't let his words disturb your emotions!"

She shouted and tried to stop their outburst. Kondou took one look at Kagali, as if uninterested. Then he glanced at his gun and put it in his pocket.

"It's too much trouble. Let's just take away your fighting strength without killing you. Come on."

As soon as Kondou held up his military sword with both hands, the air changed completely. It was an atmosphere that only a master could wield.

"Teare, can I take over here? Let's do this, human!"

The presence of both sides swelled up, and even those who had been fighting stopped fighting as if pressured. Kondou assumed the eight-phase posture and quietly waited for his enemy. Footman, on the other hand, was ready for a suicide attack with no consideration for defense. He covered his whole body with fighting aura, transformed himself into a huge bullet, charging at the enemy. He moved with an agility unimaginable for his fat body, moving as if he were rolling. Footman began to leap around Kondou, accelerating as he bounced off the ground. He repeated his erratic movements, accelerating faster and faster.

"Hohoho! Try and see this move if you can!"

Convinced that he had accelerated to his full strength, Footman unleashed his final technique on Kondou. Footman's power was called the Unique Skill 'Amplifier'. The essence of this power was amplification. Whether it was waves or masses, he could increase them at will. Just by bouncing, he could accelerate, and his weight would keep increasing, making him heavier than he looked. If someone was hit by this kinetic energy, they would be crushed to pieces no matter who the opponent was.

"Take this---'Angry Splatter'!"

Footman approached Kondou with absolute confidence and destructive power. Kondou, however, did not change his expression at all as he unleashed a sword attack.

"You should be honored for me to have used this, 'Rumbling of Heaven and Earth'^[This is one of the sword techniques from the Haze (oboro) style that Hakurou and Gazel used.]"

It was only after all was said and done that his voice was quietly heard. Footman's hands and feet had been severed in that instant. It was an unnoticeably quick operation. It would have been impossible for him to do such a feat without an overwhelming difference in strength. Although his neck was still connected to the body, bright red blood was spurting out of it. Even so, Footman would not die, but it would be difficult to continue the battle.

"Teare, was it? Bind his hands and feet, and stop the bleeding in his neck. We don't want him to die yet."

Kondou told her flatly. In his right hand was a pistol once again, and he reverted to his initial style. This gesture was a sign that he did not want to play with them any more.

"W-what are you thinking...?"

"I will not kill you. Especially you, Kagali---no, ex-demon lord Kazalim. You still have use, which is why I can't kill you."

"You fool, you think I'm going to cooperate with you after what you've done?"

"I don't need your permission. I told you, didn't I? I can manipulate others."

Kagali turned her eyes of hatred towards Kondou, saying he was a hateful man. The way he said everything was annoying to say the least. It made her feel uneasy that she was wrong, even though she was sure that she was right. Every word Kondou said irritated Kagali. At that moment, Kondou's pistol flashed a red light. Upon seeing this, Kondou's mouth relaxed. It was a small, small smile. At the same time, Kagali wondered if this man could even laugh while the biggest alarm rang in her head.

*Stalling for time...so it was true after all!*

It was too late to realize it now. Although she hated herself for being played so much, Kagali continued to search for the best way forward. What to do, she did not know, but it was certain that Kondou had all the cards in his hand. It was impossible for her to escape from this situation, and it seemed difficult for her to gain more time. In that case, there was only one path to take. Kagali was left with only one option---to nip in the bud any danger that may be posed to her fellow companions.

In other words, suicide. By choosing death, she made a decision to prevent leakage of information. However, Kagali, an undead elf, would never be truly destroyed. Although she would lose her body, she could live on by inhabiting someone else once again. Footman and Teare would sense Kagali's intention. They were also undead elves, and like Kagali, they would never really die. By setting up Kondou at the same time, the three of them would be able to accomplish their goal without Kagali thoughts being known. Even if they lost their bodies, they could avoid the worst as long as they escaped. That was Kagali's decision, and it was her trump card.

*It is an abomination to do this after Yuuki-sama had obtained this body for me. It took some time to settle into it, but it's better than losing everything. Footman and Teare will be dragged into it too, but next time I will prepare a stronger body for them.*

Kagali made a decision. Laplace would take care of the rest. Unexpectedly, Kondou was too strong. In Kagali's opinion, Kondou and Laplace were evenly matched at this stage. No, there was a possibility that Kondou was slightly stronger than Laplace. Since victory was not assured, it would be foolish to risk Laplace's victory even if Kondou and Laplace were able to meet each other at this point. Kagali decided as such. What she was worried about was how Kondou manipulated others. She wanted to find out before escaping, but it was dangerous to be too greedy. Kagali left her hesitation behind and took immediate action.

"Good grief, how am I always played as a fool by human beings? Footman, Teare, stop playing around and let's give them everything we've got. We'll show him the taste of my true power as a demon lord!"

Kagali spread her youki all over her body and exerted herself beyond her limits. Her temporary body could not withstand such a reckless act, and she had only a few minutes at most. On the other hand, she believed that this would prevent people from suspecting that she committed suicide. Footman and Teare also understood the strategy when they saw Kagali's condition.

"Hohoho, losing a limb won't stop me!"

"I'm ready for this! It's been a long time since I've really put my back into it, so I can't stop my excitement!"

As if matching Kagali, Footman also began leaping, curling his body into a circle. And Teare, like Kagali, began to release her youki. In the center of the capital, a huge youki swelled up. If Kondou thought that it was a suicide attack to kill with youki, Kagali and her team's plan would be successful. However...

Kondou did not even move his eyebrows even though he was in such a situation. He calmly put away his sword and checked the condition of his gun. Then, in a casual tone, he made a remark that made Kagali and the others feel as if cold water was dumped on them.

"I've heard that undead elves can survive with just a spiritual body."

It was a statement that could not be ignored. Among those who knew of Kagali's race, Yuuki was the only one. Even Damrada did not know this super-secret information, and there was no way that even Kondou could know of this.

"How did you..."

"The battle was all over before it began. The Armored Corps was wiped out because they underestimated the enemy and neglected to gather information. Running wildly without knowing the certainty of the situation is like a promise of defeat. Don't you think so?"

"......"

"Come to think of it, your person was also a disappointment. I let him make a move at the best time, but then he lost to the new demon lord. I can't believe he was a demon lord too."

"What?"

"Well, it was still better that he lost. We now have a better idea of what happened there, and we have a more interesting person than Clayman."

"What do you mean?!"

Kagali's anger exploded. Her thoughts of keeping calm were erased, and she was overcome by hatred for the man in front of her. Lieutenant Kondou. Kondou's statement was an admission that he had been manipulating Clayman. Clayman, as she recalled, had been running rampant for some time. Laplace reported that this tendency had increased several decades ago. Kagali had thought that it was due to the stress of becoming a demon lord, and that she was overthinking things, but if it had been Kondou's fault, that was a different story. The fact that every operation they had planned had ended in failure was unforgivable if he had been disturbed by Kondou's interference. And above all, with the death of her beloved Clayman, if Kondou had been manipulating him...

*I will not forgive. I will never forgive him.*

Kagali's anger was not something she could control. Footman, who was sensitive to the emotion of anger, also reacted to Kagali's anger and amplified it. It was ironic that everything turned out the way Kondou had wanted. No, this is exactly what Kondou expected.

"How naive. In the middle of a battle, you get emotional. It's that kind of determination that makes it so easy for you to fall into a trap like this."

Kondou told her and pulled the trigger.

"Ah!"

A small 'pop' sound was heard, and Kagali jumped. There was no blood. It was a very special kind of bullet, one that affected the mind, not the body. It was called the Dominion Bullet. It was a treasure given by Emperor Rudra, and was one of Kondou's most powerful tools.

The 'Dominion Bullet' contained a part of Rudra's power, and had the effect of controlling and manipulating others. However, it could affect only one person at a time, and a strong-minded person was likely to resist it. Although the number of the bullets was large, it was necessary to be careful about how to use it. If he failed to do so, he would expose his hand to the enemy and lose one of his pawns. If he wanted to dominate a demon lord, he had to aim at his sleeping state or make him overcome by emotion. They could be dazzled by their desires or overcome by negative emotions such as anger or sorrow. By shooting the 'Dominion Bullet' after putting the target in such a state, domination was finally possible.

"It took a while, but it's all going according to plan. Kagali, tell your men to stand down. You're a cautious one, so you've already carved a curse on your summoners, haven't you?"

"Yes, Kondou-sama."

"Don't call me that. You can refer to me as a lieutenant."

"Yes, Lieutenant Kondou. As you command."

Thus, Kagali fell into Kondou's hands. And just as Kondou had predicted, the souls of Yuuki's companions had been inscribed with a curse, so Teare and Footman were no longer able to resist Kagali's words. There were others who did not have a 'curse' inscribed on their souls, but they, too, realized the disadvantage of their situation. Fighting amongst themselves was a dog's death waiting for them, and they decided that it was better to be captured than to resist.

![break]

The silence of darkness returned to the night of the Imperial Capital.

"If you are going to hate, hate your own powerlessness. Justice exists in as many people as there are people, and it is united by a stronger will. The same is true of ideals. Your ambitions were lost before the will of His Majesty Rudra, that is all."

This was the absolute rule, survival of the fittest. Kondou knew it well.

"However, those who are unaware of being trampled on are not even qualified to have ambitions. Therefore, let me remember your regret."

Kondou himself lived with determination. That is why Kondou did not make fun of Kagali and the others. He understood from his own experience that he would suffer the same fate if he lost.

![hard scene break]

Yuuki and Damrada clashed their fists and engaged in a fierce battle. For what seemed to be the umpteenth time, they exchanged their attacks. Yuuki, who was aiming at the vital point of the face without any hesitation, caught a back fist with his palm. He tried to grip Damrada's wrist, but Damrada did not allow him to do so. Damrada tried to get his hands on Yuuki's wrists, but Yuuki did not allow him to do so.

Anticipating the hand blows, Yuuki threw a double kick while turning his upper body backward. Damrada, sensing this, sank down on the spot and executed a foot strike, but Yuuki, perhaps reading this, leapt up and tried to cut off Damrada's head with a spinning kick. However, the kick only pierced the sky.

Damrada had already moved away and was standing up. A sophisticated exchange of martial arts beyond the human realm repeated over and over again. The movements were now so regular that it was as if they were in a well choreographed action scene.

However, the speed was too fast for the eyes of ordinary people to follow. It was a pity that there were no spectators, though it would have been difficult to find a person who was good enough to appreciate the performance. It was a combat match between masters, performed only with their own well-trained bodies. But that was not all that was actually taking place.

Yuuki was trying to communicate with Damrada through 'telepathic communication' instead of conversation. Damrada responded to Yuuki's attempts by assisting Yuuki's actions. The reason why there was so much unnecessary physical contact was that they were exchanging information in that instant.

<Well, well, well. Damrada, I didn't expect you to have gained an Ultimate Skill. I didn't think it would be this hard to convey my 'thoughts' to you. Did you have it since the time you met me?>

<I borrowed it. Of course, I have owned it since I met Yuuki-sama.>

Damrada followed up with a simple remark: 'You probably didn't notice it because I don't use it very often'. As for Yuuki, he could only laugh. Now that he himself had been awakened to an Ultimate Skill, he was aware of the absolute difference in 'rank' between that and the Unique Skills. In that case, Damrada's reply contained some words that he could not ignore.

<Borrowed? What does that mean?>

By nature, skills were acquired by oneself. There were those who could create them, like Yuuki, but even then, they could not create something out of nothing. They were merely changing the form of a 'soul's power' by feeding on their own desires. That is why he could not ignore the implication that a Skill could be transferred. Damrada replied:

<It's just as it sounds. My power was only given to me by the His Majesty the Emperor.>

<How is that even possible?>

<I understand your skepticism, but I am a witness. I have no choice but to make you understand that it is possible.>

<I see... I guess you're right.>

Yuuki had no choice but to agree with him. Then, the next question arose.

<Well, I wonder if it is possible to transfer the Skill to anyone?>

'No way', laughed Damrada.

<No ordinary person can be a vessel of a Unique Skill, let alone an Ultimate Skill. It takes a lot of energy just to accept the power. Therefore, one must change their body like the otherworlders.>

<That's a relief to hear. I was afraid that Emperor was having a bargain sale on Ultimate Skills.>

<Hahaha, that hasn't happened yet. Though that is what His Majesty intends to do.>

'I see', Yuuki understood.

<So that's why you're gathering the strong.>

<That's right. Humans, too, evolve through practice. The race itself changes and becomes a sage. If it is Yuuki-sama who has become a Saint, you must understand this, too, right?>

<Sort of.>

Yuuki had a real feeling about it. It was impossible to go from a human being to a Sage, and then to a Saint, by simple ordinary training. Even of the 'Ten Great Saints' who had the title of the strongest in the Western Nations, only two of them, Hinata and Sare, had reached the level of saint in the truest sense of the word.

<It is only when people evolve into a Sage that they can break away from the framework of human beings, who are unable to live without communicating with other human beings. From there, it is possible to connect with the world while remaining an individual. Those who have reached this stage are gathered together in the Imperial Guardians, and have passed the minimum requirements for the selection of His Majesty Rudra.>

<The minimum passing line is at the Sage level?>

<Yes, it is. If Yuuki-sama had fought against Guy, he would have understood the strength of his opponent, right? Even if one is a Saint, there is no chance to win.>

<Well, that's true.>

Guy's strength was extraordinary. He knew that very well, having actually fought him. A mere mortal would never be able to take on the Demon Lord Guy Crimson.

<The minimum requirement to beat the Guy is to have awakened to the ultimate power.>

<So that's an Ultimate Skill.>

It was a story that made sense to Yuuki. He himself had gained an Ultimate Skill, so he felt it even more strongly. Someone who has an Ultimate Skill can only be defeated by another Ultimate Skill.

<That's right. His Majesty Rudra knows this very well. That is why he gives trials to those who have reached the Sage level, to encourage their further awakening, and to train them into vessels worthy of the ultimate power.>

<That's absurd. But I would do the same thing.>

<Thank you for understanding so quickly.>

Yuuki and Damrada laugh at each other. Yuuki saw that the method made sense, even though it might have been incomprehensible to ordinary people. Once the methodology was established, they would be able to gather many people who were awakened to the Ultimate Skill. Although he was annoyed that they were a step ahead, Yuuki was willing to admit what he should admit. The more important issue was the peculiarity of Rudra, who was indispensable for this method.

<The fact that Rudra can give ultimate power to others, though, is a surprise.>

<Fufufu, that is an example that proves the greatness of His Majesty Rudra. Those who have reached the Saint level are given the Ultimate Enchantment 'Alternative' by His Majesty Rudra.>

Damrada's 'thought' was proud. Yuuki couldn't help smiling as he felt his respect for Emperor Rudra. Damrada may still be loyal to Yuuki, but his feelings for Emperor Rudra were different. Even though he knew this, Yuuki still thought that he should hide it a little more. However, since Damrada usually did not make such a mistake, he must have already known it and done so deliberately.

<So Rudra started a war to awaken his men?>

<I suppose so. The last war was also thwarted by Veldora's interference, but that was a good thing. Some of us evolved into Sages, and we were able to replenish our forces beyond what we lost.>

Yuuki was jealous but impressed at the same time thinking that it took a lot of patience. They exchanged information through 'telepathic communication' even as they fought. Finally, Yuuki's power broke through Damrada's psychological barrier.

<Oh, we did it. I found the core of the power that's controlling you.>

<That's good. So, are you going to be able to disarm it?>

<Yeah, no problem. But, won't Kondou find out if I deactivate it?>

<They will find out, but that's okay.>

<In that case, I'll go for it at once.>

Yuuki and Damrada were not fighting pointlessly. Damrada knew about Yuuki's 'Anti-Skill' and believed that it could break Kondou's 'control' over him. Yuuki also recognized Damrada's idea and had been searching Damrada's state of mind without being prompted.

Then, Yuuki tried to restore Damrada with his newly awakened power. Yuuki's Ultimate Skill 'Greedy King Mammon' was specialized in taking. With 'Steal Life Palm', he could steal energy just by making contact with an opponent and he could accumulate damage to an opponent just by fist-fighting. The nature of the energy, such as mana or physical strength, that could be taken away depended on the opponent. However, the fact that he could use the stolen energy remained the same. However, against Damrada, the 'Steal Life Palm' did not work.

Damrada's strength was excellent, and he maintained his best condition even though he was controlled by Kondou. He was doing his best to block Yuuki, regardless of his intention. This was made possible by the power of the Ultimate Enchantment 'Alternative' given by the Emperor. Damrada's soul was protected by this power. An absolute psychological barrier that nullified any kind of mental attack. Absolute physical destruction that penetrated all defenses. With these conflicting forces as its two wings, Damrada had become an undefeatable entity.

Kondou was able to dominate Damrada because the 'Dominion Bullet' given to him by the Emperor was set higher than the 'Alternative'. That's right. If 'Alternative' had not been a borrowed power, Damrada would not have been controlled. In order to break such a troublesome 'Alternative', Yuuki has been using 'Anti-Skill' to break down Damrada's psychological barrier. Finally, he found the 'Dominion Bullet' that pierced Damrada's soul. As soon as he got the confirmation from Damrada, Yuuki concentrated his power at once.

<Steal Life.>

Yuuki's palm strike struck Damrada in the chest.

![full page image](image9)

The blow was precisely controlled, and it shattered only the bullet. It was a very simple move, but it set Damrada free.

"Thank you for your help, Yuuki-sama."

"I wish people would stop relying on others. I'm more worried about Kagali and the others. I'm going over there, but what are you going to do?"

"I'll go with you. We're meeting with Demon Lord Rimuru tomorrow anyway. Since we're going to stage a coup d'état with that momentum, it would be more dangerous to go back down to Kondou."

"Well, of course, there's no need to hide things."

Yuuki laughed, and Damrada laughed back.

"Shall we go then?"

"Yes, I suppose so."

Yuuki turned on his heel and headed for the door, and Damrada, who nodded, tried to follow him. But at that moment:

"Why are you playing around with the infidels, Damrada? Are you sure you are not going to betray Rudra-sama?"

A cold voice was heard, and Yuuki tensed and stopped moving. The real crisis was about to begin.

![soft scene break]

Not a sound was made. Before he knew it, she was standing there. The presence of an overwhelmingly powerful person. An incredibly beautiful woman with blue hair. Although he had never met her before, Yuuki knew the presence of this beautiful woman. It was the presence of the one who was on the other side of the curtain. The person who was called 'Marshal' and sat next to the Emperor.

"Ve-Velgrynd-sama..."

Damrada's muttering was heard loudly.

*Velgrynd? You don't mean...?*

At that moment, Yuuki became aware that his face was scrunched up. In front of the 'True Dragon', the strongest being in the world, he compared his own power with that of the True Dragon's.

*Oh, no. I didn't feel it when I saw Veldora before, but this is not on a level of winning or losing. Fighting head-on against such a thing is nothing but a suicide mission.*

Yuuki, however, did not give up. If the front door didn't work, he could attack through the back door. Yuuki still had a special card hidden in his bag of tricks. He felt that he could win the game as long as he could make good use of the cards he had in his hand.

"I never thought that Her Excellency the 'Marshal' was really a 'True Dragon'. Now I know why Guy doesn't move on his own."

"Wow, that's unusual for a human. I commend you for not being intimidated by me."

"Thank you. By the way, it would be nice if you left me alone."

"I don't care. It's not me who's looking for you, but my dear lord."

As soon as she answered, Velgrynd took a step back. Then, for the first time, Yuuki noticed the man's presence. He opened his eyes and stared at him. Standing next to Velgrynd was a man in very luxurious garments, seemingly to be of astronomical value. His face was one that Yuuki knew well.

"...Masayuki? No, it can't be. Perhaps you're the one who..."

Yuuki thought that he was a duplicate of Masayuki, but he noticed some differences. The most noticeable difference was the color of his hair. This man had shining blonde hair. Masayuki, on the other hand, usually dyed his hair blonde, but his natural hair was dark brown like a Japanese. If he looked closely, he could see a difference in their eyes. While Masayuki's eyes were somewhat dull and vacant, this man's eyes were full of a strong and all-seeing gaze. He could not believe that they were the same person, because of the man's spirit, which would consume him if he let his guard down.

*It's a different person, isn't he?*

Convinced of this, Yuuki came to realize the man's true identity. If Velgrynd called him her dear lord, it could only be one person.

"---Emperor Rudra?"

"That's right Yuuki-sama. This is the Emperor, Rudra-sama, the pinnacle of the Empire."

It was Damrada who answered. He knelt on the spot as if to show that he had no hostility towards Rudra, not caring if his clothes were soiled. Yuuki could not blame him. He knew without being told that Rudra was more important to Damrada than he was. The more important question was why Rudra was here.

"I'm surprised. I had no idea that Your Eminence would travel to a place like this. Are you that free?"

Yuuki asked as if teasing Rudra. Rudra did not get angry at him and answered normally.

"I'm very busy. The game with Guy is about to be over, so I don't have time to play around."

It was Damrada who surprised him. He had not expected Rudra to talk to someone inferior, nor had he expected Velgrynd to allow it.

"Well, then, no need to be lazy..."

"I don't care what you say. Become my subordinate. By doing so, I will not deprive you of your free will."

It was an order. From high up above, commanded to those who crawled on the ground. It was the type of person Yuuki hated the most, but for some reason he could not resist it.

*Is this 'thought guidance'? It's similar to the 'domination' of Mariabell, but much more powerful than that.*

It was an abominable force. However, Yuuki still had 'Anti-Skill', so he could ignore the commands derived from Skill. It was supposed to be that way.

*No! This is not such a simple power!*

Almost bending at the knees, Yuuki understood with a shudder. This was divinely inspired charisma^["カリスマ"---one meaning is divine power and the other meaning is transcendent leadership charisma. But in the following, it can be seen that Rudra did not use this ability when speaking, and it can be seen that Yuuki took this innate temperament as a skill and thought of it as a divinely taught ability, i.e., the misunderstanding in Yuuki's mind was directly expressed in words. This is a double entendre, so it's up to you to understand whether it's the effect of an ability or natural temperament.]. The unimaginable, overbearing domination of a ruler who could subdue all things. Yuuki resisted with all his might.

"Phew, you're good. I didn't expect you to attack with such a bogus move from the very first turn."

Yuuki spat out blood and was indignant. Manipulating others was his specialty, and being preempted made him angry. But he was right. The feeling of anger was proof that he had broken Rudra's hold on him. Yuuki looked at Rudra with a wry smile. Rudra, however, looked at Yuuki with a curious look on his face.

"What's wrong? Are you wondering why your power doesn't work?"

"No, no, no."

Rudra looked back at Velgrynd as if troubled. Velgrynd then smiled and replied to the puzzled Rudra.

"No, Rudra, this child was exposed to your dominance and mistakenly thought he had suffered a mental attack. You must be more gentle with him or you will destroy him before he becomes your subordinate."

"Don't tell me this isn't enough?"

"Yes. It's because you don't have many people you can talk to as equals that it can be difficult for you to control your power."

Rudra looked puzzled. Velgrynd looked happy. Yuuki shivered in humiliation as he heard their conversation.

*Don't play with me! You think I'm not important enough for you? In that case, let me take away that composure!*

Yuuki regained his calm and opened his mouth.

"All right, I'll admit it. You are the rulers of this world. But to have so much power and still be unable to conquer the world is, in my opinion, the height of incompetence."

As usual, he would start with a provocation. Velgrynd reacted to this.

"How arrogant. Come on, Rudra, let's kill him after all. Bringing that brat into the fold won't make much difference in our strength against Guy. It'll just be unpleasant, won't it?"

In contrast to Velgrynd, Rudra was generous.

"Don't say that. Even a worthless opponent to you can be a useful pawn if you let him grow up. And isn't it pleasant to be treated with defiance? A cat that doesn't like you is still a lovely thing. I like it."

It was a complete lowly dismissal of Yuuki. Yuuki scoffed in an uninterested way. As long as Rudra was calm, it was pointless to provoke him. If so, he would have to use force. With Velgrynd in the room, he could not take too much time. He would strike the biggest attack with his first move, and with the momentum of the attack, he would conquer even Velgrynd. Deciding as such, Yuuki took a stance.

"As for being a subordinate, I have no taste for surrendering to those who are weaker than I am. If you want me to follow you, you'll have to show me that you have what it takes!"

As soon as Yuuki shouted that, he began to take action. No more talking nonsense. There was no point in acting. The Ultimate Skill 'Greedy King Mammon' was a skill that converted the size of one's desire into power. Yuuki was proud of his own greed, and he thought it was natural that the power he took from Mariabell was awakened. Therefore, Yuuki believed that he was the most powerful being, having obtained the power of 'Greedy King Mammon'. It was a power of the great sin system, and he had no doubts about himself. Which one should Yuuki target?

He had to choose Rudra. He would control Rudra and take him as a hostage to Velgrynd. If he could get through this critical situation, he would turn this disaster into a blessing. Such bullish thinking was the driving force of Yuuki, and he had been successful so far. This time, too, he would win and make great progress. With this in mind, Yuuki ran forward.

In just a few steps, his fists were within reach. In less time than it took to blink, Yuuki's hand was about to touch Rudra. In his right hand, he activated 'Life Sucker', one of the powers of the 'Greedy King Mammon', and then Anti-Skill' in his left hand was used in conjunction. In this way, a vicious attack that penetrated through the opponent's barriers was created. This was the original use of 'Steal Life'. Unlike the case of Damrada, Yuuki attacked with a force where he did not care if he killed his opponent or not.

If Rudra died, he could concentrate just on Velgrynd. It would be difficult to escape from two strong opponents, but it would not be so difficult to escape from only one of them. If Rudra survived, it would be time to use the left hand. The effect of the left hand was 'manipulation of the mind'. It was a terrifying power that stimulated the target's emotion and even affected their memory. It was a power of domination more vicious and assured than Mariabell's 'desire'. Yuuki was planning to find a way out by using this two-stage sequence. However, this idea was easily crushed.

"I won't let Rudra touch you in front of me."

Velgrynd moved forward with such speed that Yuuki, who had pushed his physical abilities to the limit, could not follow her with his eyes. Then, Velgrynd caught Yuuki's right hand without any difficulty.

Yuuki was astonished. It was a surprise that he had been prevented from striking his right hand, but what was more shocking was the amount of energy that flowed into his hand from Velgrynd. It was such a raging torrent that Yuuki was about to vomit blood. In a single moment of crossing, the magicules had invaded Yuuki's body beyond the limit. Yuuki instantly sensed the danger and twisted his body to get away from it. If he had reacted even a little later, Yuuki's body would have been completely destroyed.

Velgrynd did not do anything. On the contrary, she did nothing except to catch Yuuki's hand. Nevertheless, Yuuki was damaged, which was, in a sense, a self-destruction. It was just that he had taken uncontrollable energy with his 'Steel Life Palm'. Yuuki thought to himself as he vomited blood and shed tears and nosebleeds.

*No way, can it be? It easily exceeded my tolerance level! I currently have a limit to accept a dozen higher spirits. How insane is this 'True Dragon' that the limit can be met in an instant?!*

Feeling like complaining to god, Yuuki grumbled. The truly fearful one was Velgrynd. She was so calm, as if she didn't even feel an itch, even though she had been deprived of that much energy. In other words, it meant that she did not even need to defend herself against Yuuki's attack. Yuuki realized that there was no way out of this.

*Damn, I didn't expect there to be such a power gap. No wonder they didn't care about me.*

This was unquestionably Guy's equal. Seeing this, Yuuki now understood the height of the world. Because he had awakened the Ultimate Skill, he understood the hopeless disparity between the two. It was suicidal to attack by himself. Now, he had no other choice but to wait for the enemy's move.

"Don't be tactless. Since I have come all the way here myself, it would be a pleasure to answer your wish to know my power, wouldn't it?"

"What a bad habit, Rudra. It'll be boring to get hurt, so let me help you."

"Fufu, it doesn't make sense. Right?"

It was a provocation. Yuuki could not keep silent when someone tried to take away his own specialty.

"Hahaha, you know what I mean. If I accept reality, that means that I'll think I've already lost. But you know, I'm not a quitter. Don't expect me to simply surrender."

Yuuki, aware of the fact that he was a sore loser, made a grand gesture. Now that he realized that he could not beat Velgrynd no matter what, the only thing he could do was protect his pride. Even if it would mean his death, he was determined to follow his selfishness to the end. Yuuki glared at Rudra with such spirit. Rudra smiled at Yuuki's glare.

"After all, I'll deal with him myself. Let me tell you first that I am good at 'domination'. If you can withstand this, you win."

Yuuki's eyes narrowed when he heard this unexpected offer. Rudra meant what he said. He truly meant that he did not mind if Yuuki ran away. Although Yuuki could not read Rudra's intention, Rudra's thinking was simple. If Yuuki accumulated more experience, he would be able to gain more power. On that basis, he would be able to negotiate with Yuuki again one day to bring him to his side. Yuuki and Rudra were different beings. Therefore, Yuuki felt that Rudra was creepy and resented that he was being treated as a fool.

*Good at domination, are you? That's what I'm good at, too. I'll bet it all on the power of the 'Greedy King Mammon'.*

Rudra looked at Yuuki with amusement, and his heart was filled with excitement at the prospect of competing for the first time in a long time. If Yuuki could withstand his 'domination', he might be leading a bug into his lion's den. Despite this possibility, Rudra chose to play the game.

*If it crumbles here, then my supremacy will have been just that.*

He did not bother to think about losing. If Yuuki pretended to follow him, that would be a good thing. He was confident that he was a ruler who would rule the world by taming such pawns. Velgrynd had known Rudra for a long time. She understood what Rudra was thinking without being told. Therefore, she understood that there was no use in rebuking him.

"All right. Then, if you lose, I will avenge you."

With that, Velgrynd stepped back.

"That is a needless worry."

Rudra stepped forward with a wry smile. Yuuki, too, forced his screaming body to stand up.

"Funny, you guys. No wonder Guy called you a joker who stirs up the game board."

"...How did you know that?"

"Hoo, was it the Moderate Clown Troupe? Tatsuya just reported in. We have the chairman of the Moderate Clown Troupe. I should let you know that I have all the information about you. You may challenge me with that in mind."

Tatsuya was Lieutenant Kondou. Rudra must have been in contact with Kondou in some way who had reported that he had now taken Kagali. Yuuki, realizing this, let out a deep sigh---it was bad.

In other words, everything about Yuuki's peculiar constitution and the conversation he had with Guy was now known to all of them. Yuuki had told those whom he trusted that he had awakened to his Ultimate Skill. Damrada seemed to have kept the secret, but it was meaningless in this situation. Kagali was Yuuki's confidant, and of course he shared the secret with him.

*Oh, man, what a mess. So then they know everything about me...*

Yuuki felt like giving up everything. However, his pride would not allow him to retreat at this point. And more than anything else...

*Is Kagali not dead too? It seems that Rudra himself is the one who dominates, and Kondou can handle the same kind of power. If so, it would be better to just...*

Yuuki made a plan in that instant. Although the probability of success was very low, he felt lighter than if he had simply taken on the challenge without any plan.

"This is very kind of you. But you know, being kind can mean the death of you!"

"No problem. I'm of the disposition to consider myself completely victorious only when I surpass my opponent's all-out effort. So, you, too, do your best without any regrets."

As soon as he said this, Rudra took another step forward. Then he took a unique stance, unarmed. Rudra was a swordsman by nature. The sword on his waist was proof of this, and he intended to use only the power of 'domination' against Yuuki, as he had declared. Yuuki had already recognized Rudra's character. He was honest and sincere in his fight, which was not typical of a ruler. That was why he was easy to read.

*Frankly, it's impossible to win in any honest sense. Even if I could manage Rudra, there would still be Velgrynd. Since escape from this place is impossible, all I can do is to nullify Rudra's 'domination', right?*

No, Rudra was expecting that. He had overwhelming confidence that he could control Yuuki. Then, the only thing Yuuki could do was---

"Come on, Rudra!"

Yuuki risked everything on a small chance.

"---Regalia Dominion!"

Rudra moved in a very beautiful motion, and in an instant, the distance between Yuuki and Rudra became zero. Then he invoked the 'Domination of the Champion'. This was the essence of Rudra's power to subdue anyone---Ultimate Skill 'Justice King Michael'. Unlike the counterfeit one lent to Kondou, this one had no limitations and its power was far superior to any other. There was a difference in the 'quality' of Ultimate Skills as well. It was impossible for the newly awakened Yuuki to resist this power.

![break]

Rudra stood tall. Yuuki crumpled to the ground. The winner seemed clear, but the result was unknown.

"Are you sure you don't want me to kill him? These guys will just pretend to obey you and then try to take your head off in your sleep, right?"

"I don't care. That's the best part. I'll let him off the hook as a reward for resisting my control."

Despite his words, Rudra's confidence did not waver. Convinced of his absolute 'dominance', he never doubted his victory.

"Okay, then."

The winner, Rudra, smiled wryly. Then he turned to Damrada, who had melted into a corner of the room, and spoke to him in a friendly manner.

"Forgive me, Damrada, but I cannot be disturbed by you just yet."

"Everything will be done according to Your Majesty's will."

That was all that was needed for the two of them to communicate.

"When he wakes up, you take care of him."

"Understood."

Satisfied with the reply, Rudra left with Velgrynd in tow. The purge had just begun. As the Emperor moved, the times would change. The capital, too, would not escape the upheaval. It was on that day. The sky turned red in spite of the midnight hour, and crimson rain poured down incessantly, enveloping the night.
